"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	not sure if i can call it satisfying, but it's still a good one in 2003 i wrote a thesis on mortgage backed securities. the whole thing did not make sense to me and told my professor as much, but added: 'what do i know? i'm just a student and wall street guys must know what they're doing.' and then 2008 happened.	732	41748	bmyv30	en1fdkz
"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"late to the party here, but what the hell, 'cause this story is bonkers. back in the early '90s i was in my early twenties and, as people in their early twenties often do, i spent a lot of late nights at my local denny's hanging out with friends and drinking cheap coffee. the late-night wait staff was pretty small, so my friends and i wound up getting to know them pretty well -- socializing with them as well. some of them would hook us up with free fries or sodas, that kind of thing, and every now and again if things were slow, they'd sit at our booth with us. one of the people who would hang out with us was charles. charles was an older guy in his 50s who was very nice to my friends and me, but he was a little. creepy. he would never get overt about it, but he definitely embraced the whole 'creepy uncle' persona, maybe even being a little tongue-in-cheek about it. he'd tell the girls in my group how pretty they were, and how he wished he was still young, that sort of thing. reading between the lines, he was telling them he wished he could have sex with them. but this is not going where you think it is. i'm just setting the stage, y'all. the guy was a little weird, but he *was* a nice guy to us. all the same, i remember telling people ""charles has a secret. he's in his fifties, slinging coffee at an all-night restaurant, but he comes off as educated and sort of worldly. he talks about traveling and living well -- i don't know what it is, but charles is damaged. i bet he killed somebody or something."" i was convinced that the ""nice guy"" bit was a cover for something dark. uh, yeah. so as my group got older, people came and went, some of us fell out with others, some of us got real jobs and couldn't stay up until 4:00am at a denny's, and we eventually stopped hanging out there. never really gave charles much thought after that, for years. then i saw charles on the news. turns out charles was charles rothenberg, a man who, in 1983, was going through a bad divorce. in what i understand was originally intended to be a murder-suicide, he drugged his six-year-old son david, doused the boy in kerosene, and lit him on fire. david survived, but was horribly scarred for the rest of his life. charles continued to get into criminal trouble, and was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison as a result of california's ""three strikes"" law. he's still in prison today, but in the late '90s he changed his name to ""charley charles,"" because sure, why not. in 1988 there was a tv movie based on the incident called ""david,"" which starred bernadette peters as his mother. meanwhile his son david became one of michael jackson's child-friends and eventually an artist. when he was 19, he visited charles in prison, apparently reading a prepared statement to him: ""charles, you are not my father. you are an impostor. parents don't hinder their children from experiencing a normal childhood. i wish that you could experience the trauma and pain that i have gone through."" afterward, david told the press ""he wanted me to know that he loved me. the last thing i said was, 'no you don't.' and i walked out."" in a somewhat bizarre turn, david later legally changed his own name to ""dave dave,"" mirroring the ""charley charles"" name his father adopted. i have no idea if this is coincidental somehow, but the irony is not lost on me, that's for sure. dave dave even appeared on the larry king show to talk about michael jackson when he died. if i recall correctly, he defended jackson against the reports of child molestation and denied he was a victim of jackson's. unfortunately dave dave himself passed away last year, at the age of 42 -- his ongoing medical issues, which were the result of his burn injuries, eventually killed him. and in my opinion, that means charles was ultimately successful in murdering his son. so, yeah. i called it -- charles was harboring something dark when he was getting free fries for my friends and telling the girls how pretty they were. i just had no idea how dark."	2393	41748	bmyv30	en20er1

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"probably too late but i want to share this anyway. the last few months of my wife's pregnancy with my daughter, the little baby would regular as clockwork, around 1030pm, put her feet against my wife's ribs and try to straighten her legs so she could head butt her way out of my wife. bam - headbutt to the inside of your . whatever. my wife would fucking jump up cursing like a sailor every time. it was painful, but also hilarious, reliable, and i guess we knew she'd be an active little kid well before she was born. &nbsp; cut to the evening of her birth - the doctor is telling us around 9pm that things are going well, but he's going to go get dinner because he has't eaten and there's no way this kid is coming out before midnight. i look at my wife, look at the doc, and say ""don't go far, the kid is going to deliver herself around 1030pm, i promise you. you're just going to have to catch her."" he laughed, told us he's been doing this a long time, and he wasn't worried. 1025 he's rushing in and barely gets his gloves and scrubs on before my daughter shoots herself out of mommy like a greased bullet. direct quote from the doctor looking at me as he holds my little darling, ""well, i guess even i can learn things still."" i don't blame him at all - who would believe parents about something like that? but that kid had done so many test runs, on such a regular schedule, i knew there was no stopping her. and fair game, getting headbutted daily for a month or whatever as a trade off to having a *very* short and easy labor? there are worse deals!"	4283	41748	bmyv30	en1xgsh

"the first avengers movie, my husband was wondering why the staff could stop the almighty tesseract. i casually said, ""maybe, they're both infinity stones."" he said, ""nah, the tesseract is its own thing."" because he was more into the comics at the time, i shrugged it off. since then, every macguffin in the movies, down to thor's dark world, i jokingly said, ""infinity stone"" to troll him. you can imagine how pissed he's been since gaurdians."	3336	41748	bmyv30	en1sp35
"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	i've been practicing law in the same venue for many years with the same judges and attorneys. new hotshot attorney out of law school is opposing counsel. it's a death case. my client was not responsible, but opposing counsel would not listen to reason. on the eve of trial, my client is willing to offer a decent amount to settle the case. i call the attorney and encourage her to take it. i told her that if she didn't accept, when we went to trial the next day i was going to have all her evidence thrown out and strike her witnesses. she thought i was bluffing. i assured her i was not. i told her to call any attorney in the area and ask them if i was a straight shooter. she basically told me to fuck and and that she'd see me at trial. sure enough, the judge excludes her documentary evidence (all hearsay) and strikes her witnesses. she has zero evidence when the judge is through with her. her client was in tears. i think she got sued for malpractice. she wasn't at that firm long after that debacle. but i fucking told her that would happen.	1177	41748	bmyv30	en1wklc

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	friend of mine got into a relationship with this girl. he tells me that she cries every time he tries to end their chat. i immediately think to myself, this isnt gonna be good. she becomes incredibly controlling, to the point of our crew only hearing from him once every few weeks. i mentioned how utterly fucked it was to him, but he refused to believe that there was something wrong. claimed he could persuade her otherwise. two years later, no sign of any of his progress. was really sad to watch him slowly fade out of our lives in favor of her. edit: just a quick rephrase for clarity.	3458	41748	bmyv30	en1bgct

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	in high school my best friends little sister (16 at the time) brought home her new 18 year old bf from work to meet the family. i was over at the time and talked to him for a while because we were the same age. after meeting him something was off, i got the impression that 1) he was much older than claiming 2) had been in jail. i wound up saying something to my friend, who told his parents and sister. long story short the family freaked out on my for spreading rumors that weren't true, telling me to mind my own business etc. 2 years later the sister comes home from a date with him in tears. he finally came out and admitted to her that 1) he was 30, not the now 20 he was saying 2) he had spent 2 years in prison, but refused to say for what. i was very quick to point out to the family how i called this years earlier and was basically shamed out of their house. edit: rather than responding to everyones comments i figured it was easier to add an edit on a few things. 1) im really not sure how the family didnt immediately pick up he was a lot older. i can only venture to guess and would rather not speculate. also, this was before the time of being able to google someone and look up their records 2) im still close with my friend and his family, there was a point later on where i got a gee, maybe we should have listened to you. 3) i have no clue what he was in jail for, still dont know. 4) for those who called me insensitive for pointing out i was right almost immediately, i was 20 had previously taken a lot of grief for calling this out and it wasnt exactly let go quickly on their end.	16654	41748	bmyv30	en1k8v8

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"when a penny stock i bought around $0.03/share blew up to over $3. my only regret is not buying a lot more shares. edit: for those asking, here's my take based on my very limited experience with penny stocks. you can usually buy penny stock through your typical broker. you must be particularly wary of penny stocks because they can be subject to the phenomenon of ""pump and dump"": one or more people (likely those who have stake in whatever company is offering penny stock) hype it up and hope that people will buy. as the price creeps up, those stakeholders may decide to sell and thus reap the rewards, while those who naively assume going long is best will hold on to that stock with hopes that it'll blow up. the number of penny stock failures i've invested in far outnumbers the successes. like i've bought hundreds of thousands of shares of stock less than $0.01/share and seen it basically become valueless as the stakeholders have presumably sold their stake before the per share price hits the toilet. it's extremely hit-or-miss, to say the least."	13048	41748	bmyv30	en0yp70

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	my husband is super medically fragile - he's had cancer twice and a bone marrow transplant in the last 9 years. a few years ago he had surgery on his wrist and i had a gut feeling he was brewing an infection despite being on antibiotics. his surgeon's office saw him and switched abx. i contacted the cancer center because i just knew it was going to become more. they blew me off and punted back to the surgeon's office. i knew this was beyond the surgeon's scope. i pitched a tantrumy fit and pretty much told them they were going to see them and i wasn't accepting no for an answer. the triage phone nurse was condescending and telling me it was probably nothing and could wait. we got to the clinic and the nurse there started looking around the incision site. she told me that she believed my gut and pushed to admit him. the ct showed a huge infection that landed him in the hospital for a week on potent iv antibiotics with another surgery to clean out the site. edit: whoa. silver? thank you, kind stranger. adding on - he is followed by a pharmd in his bmt clinic as well as utilizes a pharmacy just for patients like him (it's not a retail pharmacy). he obviously has a lot of other issues too. and i'm just doing what a spouse is supposed to do. i'm no saint and sometimes i lose my temper at both him and the situation. if there's anything i can beg of you all, please check in on older relatives if they're hospitalized or in homes and double check that their meds are correct and their medical history is right. we're lucky enough that i'm not older or confused, and that i'm astute enough to keep up with his info. hell, i've made a few stumbles along the way and i'm reasonably intelligent. i can see how easy it could be to mess things up if someone wasn't capable.	13904	41748	bmyv30	en1ezkk

"oh fuck. well, i don't want to go into too many details, but i was friends with a groomer type. this was a guy who i had celebrated basketball championships with, who i had been to dinners with, who i had gone to parties with. but something felt off. slight disclosure, i'm working in the youth department of a church at the time and he's the youth pastor. the ""i fucking called it moment"" happened when i go to the head pastor to say something's wrong. i think he's messing around with the girls. and i think he's a little unstable, so if someone doesn't put a stop to this, he's going to end up killing someone. i get kicked out for bs reasons. one year later. i'm part of a new church doing good work in the hood and helping raise money, clothing, that sort of thing for disadvantaged people. i get a call from one of the girls from that old church group. turns out my old friend was hooking up with underage girls and ended up murdering one of them. guy's in prison now. edit: i'm just now realizing this thread is about the moment being ""satisfying."" this moment was not satisfying, it only helped take a burden off of me because i thought maybe the head pastor was right and the problem had actually been me. 2nd edit: i'm not giving out anymore details because there are young girls who attended there whose identities would be at risk if i gave the name."	10557	41748	bmyv30	en1dgfi

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"in my 1st year in college, on my level 1 motor vehicle engineering course, we were being taught how to change spark plugs and adjust the timing on engines. so my then friend, we'll call him ryan, is working with me on a 1998 audi a3 1.8 non-turbo. we both agreed that i should do the timing, as i was more confident about it (which makes little sense thinking about it now), and that he wanted to remove the spark plugs. when he was taking out the 1st plug, i noticed that he wasn't very careful about it. for those of you who don't know much about cars, spark plugs are made of ceramic and metal, and the ceramic is easy to snap if you're not careful, and when it does, little pieces of ceramic will end up falling inside the cylinder, which, if the car is started, can cause *serious* damage to your engine. anyways, i tell ryan that he should be careful about taking out the spark plugs. he just says ""nah nah man it's fine, they're made of metal."" i didn't reply as i noticed that he didn't give a shit about the job. so he unscrews the 2nd spark plug and pulls really hard as he can't fully undo it, and right there, i hear the spark plug snap in half. and to top it off, the entire ceramic part of the spark plug fell inside the cylinder. i immediately told him to tell the tutor, which he of course didn't. so then after he moves away from the car, our tutor tells us to move the car to a different spot. i give ryan the keys and say ""go on then"", as i didn't have my license then. so he gets in, and starts the car, and right from the start, me and the tutor can hear that something is knocking inside the engine, and before the tutor could tell ryan to switch it off, we hear a very loud pop, and the engine stops by itself. right there and then, out loud i looked ryan straight in the eyes and said ""i fucking called it you dickhead."" he got kicked off the course since this was *an actual teacher's car* edit: to those of you saying that this could also be my fault for the car getting fucked, you're not wrong. i'm glad i've changed since then."	6267	41748	bmyv30	en14yxl

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"when i was in sixth grade, i became friends with a couple other girls in my neighborhood. we each had completely different backgrounds, but we just clicked. for years, we three did all the things good friends do. the only thing i, personally, didn't like was to stay over at the house of one of these girls, i'll call her brianna. i'd sleep over at the other girl's house, they could sleep at mine, but i always came up with an excuse not to stay at brianna's. she started to get her feelings hurt but i ignored it. then when we were all about 16, somebody go ahold of liquor, and we all sat around drinking. being drunk, we got into a little debate about who is better friends with who, and i was somehow accused of not ""liking"" brianna as much as the other friend because i wouldn't spend much time at her house. since i had zero filter at that moment, i blurted out, ""brianna. it isn't you. it's your dad. he's a child molester, i can tell just by looking at him."" as soon as i said it, everything changed. i apologized, that didn't work of course. both of my best girlfriends dumped me that day. i still had a solid best friend, but i had to get myself a new group for sure. also, they started bullying me a bit, but i just took it because of the horrible thing i said about brianna's dad. i felt super guilty. three years later, i was out of high school, living with my best friend who was still friends with brianna. i got home from class and there was brianna sitting on the living room couch. it was so uncomfortable. i decided to try to apologize again. ""hey, i know you are probably sick of hearing this, but i am so very sorry for what i said about your dad, brianna. please forgive me, i still don't know why i'd say such a thing."" she sort of chuckled and said, ""it's no big deal, he molested all of us."" i never questioned my intuition again, because i fucking called it the second i saw that perv. edit: thanks for the gold by ""us,"" i believe she meant all of the daughters in the family, there were three. i don't know if any of my former friends were molested. last i heard, i was still a shit talker about her dad and i wasn't going to correct them and humiliate her again. i figure she can tell who she wants. no, i'm not proud that i called her dad a child molester. it all came out because her younger sister said something to a church minister, but he was never brought into the criminal justice system and brianna moved out of state. she and i remained friendly and kept in touch for several years but lost contact. i still do feel really bad about saying that about her dad to her, it was a shitty thing to say. i could have kept it to myself and just stayed away from their house but drunk me doesn't do that i guess. i'm surprised at all the people who are responding that they have a similar story. i'd like to read them."	19093	41748	bmyv30	en1gjyz

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"oh boy do i have a good story for this one. in college i went to a theme park with my then-boyfriend, right before i moved away to california (we had decided to break up as he didn't want to do long-distance, mostly his decision). he had driven us in his suv. he has really bad eyesight and had just gotten brand new glasses, i believe they cost about $400. as we're going up the stairs in line for a roller coaster, i said, ""hey, why don't you give me your glasses and i'll stick them in my purse."" he said, ""nah, it'll be fine."" and i said, ""are you sure? you're making a $400 bet where if you win you just get to keep what you already have."" and he said, ""the forward momentum of the roller coaster will keep them on my face."" so i thought, he's an adult, whatever. literally first drop of the roller coaster i hear him yell over the roar of the wind, ""do you have my glasses???"" so we spent the next hour walking around the base of the roller coaster looking for them and leaving a report at the lost and found booth. i then had to drive us home in his suv, which i had never driven before. he had to attempt to navigate while practically blind. so yeah, still pretty smug about that one."	276	41748	bmyv30	en1tnh5
"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	we got a neighbor on our street who just gave me a weird vibe like something was off about him. i kept telling my family who shrugged me off as judging a book by its cover. well about 2 months later we get a letter in the mail from another neighbor who took it upon themselves to alert all parents. turned out he was a child molester of a child under 14. once i opened that letter i went to them and said i fucking told you guys something was off about him. guy still gives me the creeps when i see him.	58	41748	bmyv30	en1mirn
"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	im on the airplane traveling home after seeing family and i keep trying to throw up on landing. i looked at my husband that night and told him that i was pregnant. he was a little shocked that id think that since our other kid was 7 months old, i was exclusively nursing and i would have only been about 2 weeks along at that point. a home test wouldnt have shown anything at that point so i walked into the ob clinic and asked for a pregnancy test. they didnt believe me but humored me, regardless. our second kid showed up 9 months later and the nurse i talked to still couldnt believe that i was right so early in pregnancy.	53	41748	bmyv30	en1nx5i

"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"co worker didn't like the new boss we had to transition under. from day 1 co-worker was openly being insubordinate, talking shit about new boss behind their back. but the thing that put it over the top for me was the day she came into our breakroom ""bragging"" that new boss had asked her to do something and she'd handed new boss back a sticky note with a number of who to call in order to resolve the situation. co-worker was convinced she was invaluable and wouldn't be let go because all of our clients love her so much (they don't). the worst part was that she hated new boss so much she brought the whole vibe of the workplace down to a hell hole. every day there was something new to bitch about. we were all just venting receptacles to her. even though i consider her a friend i was quietly beginning to pray for the day our boss had enough. i told my good friends that worked with us ""yup she's gonna get fired"" and sure enough, a few months later she was let go. when she told me, she called the office crying on the phone and i could barely muster an ""i'm sorry"" because i was so relieved that i wouldn't have to work with her anymore."	50	41748	bmyv30	en1k0bh
"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"i would often hear scraping of furniture over the floor in the studio apartment above mine, sometimes in the dead of night. it had kept me up a few times, but as i didn't have anything going on at the time, it didn't bother me that much. i did once knock on her door to ask what was going on, she apologized and stopped that night. however, for about a month i'd have to get up at 7 a.m. during the week, so i knocked on her door politely asked if she could stop doing it after 11 in the evening. she said okay. there was some loud talking going on in the hallway (sign at the bottom floor clearly states absolute silence in the hallways), went upstairs and knocked on the door opposite to hers just after it closed. it was her again, and the guy who owns the room. i didn't approach it too well, she got pissed and brought up an issue she had with me. fine, that was fair enough. but then she proceeded to claim ""i haven't done it in months"", and ""okay, i won't do it again."" both of which where obviously bullshit. i started to think with the insane amount of cleaning going on, that she had some form of ocd. friend came over, told me he used to date her. he didn't want to mention it, but i was able to put it together and ask about the ocd thing, which he confirmed. (and we're not talking ocd the way that people use it, actually diagnosed ocd.) at that point i felt pretty conflicted. i felt completely vindicated and was pissed at her lies. on the other hand, i know how difficult the issue can be and how hard it probably is to be confronted about it by someone who's mostly a stranger."	51	41748	bmyv30	en1numl

"this is kind of bleak but definitely one of these moments. i have one bio sibling (and lots of step ones), an older brother. he has always been a fucking monster - narcissistic, cruel, unpredictable, threatening, etc. just all around an awful person who treated me like garbage the entire time we were growing up. we were always shuttling between our (divorced) parents houses so even when one family got a break, i was always with him. every time i tried to point out that he was awful to an extreme degree, particularly to me, i was told ""he's your brother, brothers pick on their sisters, he's just doing it to get a rise out of you, ignore him, you're being too sensitive, he's your brother and you have to love him."" years go by, he and i live in different states and even though occasionally i am forced by people like my grandma to spend time with him, i generally just text him once ever few months to assuage my bad-sister guilt but continue to really genuinely believe he is a bad, abusive person, which i know from first hand experience. i make no effort to see him, ever. one day my dad calls me and says they've found out through his old roommate (who has been trying to find him so she can get the rent she's owed) that he has been missing for months. turns out the fbi raided their apartment and confiscated all his electronics because he was under suspicion for distributing child porn. we eventually discovered through credit card records that he is somewhere in montenegro. i was like hey fam, i hate to say i told you so but i fucking told y'all so. he's not just mean, he's evil. that was in 2016 and i have not seen or heard from him since. hope i never do."	43	41748	bmyv30	en2dm9u

what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	"teach yourself to do crazy stuff in excel! i taught myself how to do crazy stuff in excel. my last job was in purchasing and we used a lot of spreadsheets. i started out learning formulas to do things quicker. then i moved to more in-depth formulas like vlookup, then index-match. i would just look at a process that i was doing in excel, wonder if it could be done quicker or automatically, then google how to do it. eventually this lead to automating things in excel using vba. i have literally no background in technology but it wasn't hard to figure out! before i left that job, i had multiple reports in excel that would open themselves up at scheduled points in the day, update themselves, then email themselves to the correct people. i'm an attorney now, but i run my day through a schedule i made in excel. it has all my cases and times/dates. it has a data entry form that i can use to quickly update the schedule or add to it. if i click on the cell with the opposing counsel's name, it brings up their full contact info plus an option to draft an email to them. the email auto fills the subject line with the case number and defendant's name, automatically has my signature, and starts the email off with ""(attorney name),"". when i add a new case, the schedule creates a new folder for it in a designated location and autofills that folder with templates of word documents that i use for notes and trial prep. if i click on the cell with the next hearing's date, it pulls up a little calendar with that date circled and tells me how many work days i have to prepare. it also tracks how my cases are resolved. i'm working on that today, actually. the goal is to be able to click a button and get a report that breaks down cases by outcome, judge, opposing attorney, and crime. then i can use it to look for places i need improvement. edit: to clear up some confusion, we do have case management software and i do use it religiously. but when i started, i was bouncing between that software, physical calendars, emailed calendars in excel, physical notes on legal pads/sticky notes, business cards, etc. etc. it was a pain in the ass, so i made this as a kind of hub to keep me organized. it basically shows me what cases need worked on in the management software and when that work needs done. and it organizes it all in chronological order while giving me a centralized area that has quick access to things like my notes or contact information. as far as learning how to do things in excel, i found that you will almost always learn more and retain information better if you have a goal in mind. if you go into this wanting to learn how to automate a weekly sales forecast, it will be so much easier than if you go in just wanting to know more about excel in general. i'm trying to reply to comments and questions, but there are a lot! i'm not great at explaining how things work, because i'm still learning. but seriously, if i can figure this out, anyone can."	25318	48921	bsg50t	eon8dru

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	so ive had the same 3 best friends since i was a kid friend 1 has an insanely hot older sister, like absolute smoke show, and me and friend 2 and 3 always thought she was super sexy somehow, friend 2 ends up sleeping with friend 1s said sister, and me and friend 3 know about it, but friend 1 does not one night, we are all drunk in my basement, and friend 1 and friend 2 end up getting in a roasting war. not essentially an argument or anything, just friendly banter and insults. friend 1 (the one with the hot sister) is really digging into friend 2 (the one who fucked the hot sister) and seems to be winning the roasting war. in a last ditch effort to recover from shame, friend 2 proceeds to drunkenly say yeah? well i fucked your sister!! after that, im pretty sure the tension in the room was so thick that it raised the temperature in the room by like 10 degrees. (we are all still best friends btw, friend 1 is still a little mad though but i cant blame him)	361	23706	bm8dfx	emvl46p

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"not awkward for me, but i was the reason for it. i served for a couple years and worked multiple restaurants in that time frame. i worked at a dennys, nightshift, best and worst job for many reasons. anyways there was a regular that came in often, drunk as a skunk and nasty as hell. he tipped really well but was so nasty to us girls. it never phased me so i served him often, he offered many many times to pay for ""extra service"" and tried to get me to leave with him often. of course i never did but a couple months later im working a new place (little more high end) i work mornings here, and this was a sunday morning church rush. guess who was sat in my section, my nasty regular from my last job with his entire family. his wife, kids, parents, the whole group, fresh outta church. the look on this mans face when i walked up and said hello. he was red as a firetruck, and i made it worse by asking if he remembered me. he left me a huge tip, probably because i didn't bring up his nasty mouth and grabby hands from his late drunken nights. ***edit*** i was a waitress, that's what i meant by serving**"	14000	23706	bm8dfx	emunwro
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was a teenager with a boner. pretty standard so far. i walked downstairs and had to tuck it in my pajamas so the head is sticking strait up and the erection is pinned against the body so the boner isn't noticeable. well, when i put my t-shirt on it fell behind the tip so if you looked at my wasit line you could clearly see the tip of my penis. i was talking to my mom for a few minutes and she was flushed red in the face and quickly trying to kill conversation - *not* something my mom is known for. i walked away, saw what was going on and didn't know what the hell to do. we never discussed it but because things were so awkward at dinner, i'm pretty sure my mom knew that i realized it happened as well.	12981	23706	bm8dfx	emur2rw
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i was interviewing for a big promotion at my old job. i had put in the time, the hours, and the effort for this promotion, and i had been passed up a few times, so i was sending out resumes while trying to get this promotion. i go through the first interview, and everything seemed great. they invited me for the second interview. i was so excited. flash forward two days, and i go in for the interview. the interview is with the regional and site managers. everything is going great, they are asking me ""what are your priorities, goals, etc"" at the end, the site manager changes his posture and says, ""would you say that you're a loyal employee, nessabessa34?"" taken aback, i say, of course, i've been here almost 2 years, etcetcetc. and like a shark circling his prey, this dude turns his computer monitor around, and shows me my private facebook posts that i posted that i was in the market for a job in the same field. now, there's no way he could have seen this, as it was a friends only post. someone i work with had to have tattled on me here. he then proceeds to read them to me out loud, not only the posts about my job search, but personal posts about my health situation and questions that i didn't bring up to anybody other than personal friends. i look at the regional manager and this guy won't look me in the eyes, he is shifting, obviously uncomfortable. i tried to say that i was looking just in case this promotion didn't work out, as i am a college student paying my way through school, but he kept interrupting me and saying ""loyalty is key"" he then tells me ""we will think about it"" and points toward the door. the regional manager kind of coughs and goes to shake my hand, but by that point i was already out the door. so i said ""thanks anyways"" and then proceed to have the most uncomfortable walk back to my desk, ( i was wearing heels for the first time in like a year so i stumbled on my way out the door) with coworkers asking for the details if i got the promotion. not as uncomfortable as some of you, but this one was definitely a top for me. edit: i've had a lot of messages/comments about what happened after this. -i didn't get the job. i think the whole thing was just an ""in your face"" type deal. i went on to get a promotion in a different department. i worked there for about another year and a half, and then i moved on to work for netflix, actually. so it all worked out! that manager was unfortunately promoted to regional, but the replacement manager was much nicer and not a huge dickwad."	3642	23706	bm8dfx	emuqp3w

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this poor girl walked into my lecture by mistake about halfway through. this particular professor really enjoys talking to all of his students and was super engaging even with 400+ students in his class. when the girl walked in, my professor stopped teaching, looked at the girl and asked if she was in the class. she said she was and began walking towards the front where the open seats were. this is a fairly large lecture hall and all 200 students (approx how many actually show up to class) were now forced to watch this poor girl walk towards a seat because the professor didnt continue talking and just stared at her. she got close to the front and i think the pressure of the whole room got to her and she said, actually no im not, and turned around and we all had to watch this poor girl climb back up the stairs and out of the hall. i was literally watching my worst nightmare.	10118	23706	bm8dfx	emv6zdy
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i have a regular breakfast place that i had been frequenting on the weekends for about a good 5-6 years. one day i went into work later because of a doctors appointment, so i decided to pick up some breakfast at my regular place. i walk in and i take a look around to find a spot to sit at and i see my dad. hes sitting in a corner spot with some woman i dont recognize. he looked shocked and i decide to walk over. he stands up and gives me a kiss/hug and introduces her as a coworker. it was the most awkward introduction of my life. my dad was an ac repairman and was strictly on the road. no women in his office. i pretended like i believed him, said hello and sat down on my own. definitely one of the most awkward moments of my life that will stand out for a long time. more background: my mom and dad havent been together since before i was born however he was married to another woman when this took place. the waitresses were all my friends and a couple days later when i went for breakfast they proceeded to tell me how he met that lady there every week. i never brought it up to him and pretended it never happened. that was about 14 years ago. i still go to that breakfast place and the girls told me after that day he never came back to that restaurant. in a couple of weeks it will be 1 year since he passed. im glad i got this opportunity to think and talk about him.	782	23706	bm8dfx	emviqkl

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my family's not super religious but, when i was about 13, they decided to go to synagogue on purim for some reason. part of purim involves reading from the book of esther, which has a part about esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on his throne in the throne room and when he sees her, he stands up and extends the golden sceptre. when the rabbi got to that part, my 13 year old brain pictured esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on the shitter and burst out laughing. no one else laughed. instead, everyone turned to stare at me and i had to explain myself to an entire room of people. we now celebrate purim in the comfort of my parents' home.	1741	23706	bm8dfx	emv06ta

"i was once travelling through europe with a group of around 10 folk. we stopped in paris one night and went out, we had a lovely dinner and then everyone was sticking about for drinks after. there was an old man who was sat alone at the table next to us, one of my friends asked him if he wanted to sit with us and he seemed quite happy about that. a few hours on the man had told this whole story about how his wife had passed away last year, she was the love of his life and they had planned to go travelling together but her illness took her before they could go, and he was now travelling around because it was one of the last things she had said to him. he goes around to all the places that they had said they would visit together and he buys post cards to bring home and put in a wee area with photos of his wife back home. now this guy was pretty much speaking uninterrupted, we were just listening to this beautiful story, everyone was a little bit drunk, but out of nowhere, after he had finished his story, told us all about his wife, shed a few tears. one of my friends absolutely blitzed, after a moment of silence goes: ""so! what's a good looking man like yourself doing all on your own?!"" the old guy kind of looks at us and says ""well, if i could be with my wife i would be""friend replies with ""ah c'mon you gotta get out there you know? you should go talk to her"" pointing at a waitress. we were horrified, and are just like 'nooo stop talking' because he had somehow completely blanked out this whole conversation with this guy. and i get up and start to get him up to take him back to where we were staying and he, while moving is just like ""you only live once"" and keeps saying things like that while we walk away. the next day he was mortified and had no idea of the encounter and didn't even remember meeting the guy."	685	23706	bm8dfx	emv89bq

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this was several years ago. i was over at my boyfriends parents house for his dads birthday. im fairly awkward and my boyfriend likes to joke, so he walks up to his dad and tells him i have a present for him. his dad turns to me and says well great! lets see it! i did not have a present for him. i still cringe thinking about having to tell him i didnt actually have a gift for him.	348	23706	bm8dfx	emv27am
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	copied from another question i answered cos i'm too lazy to retype. i worked on a deli counter and that meant having to give customers free samples when they wanted to try a product. let me first say i can be very socially awkward sometimes and i am not a very confident person - i was about 22 years old at the time. female btw. guy in his late 40s/early 50s comes to the counter and wants to try some olives - i go to the cupboard behind the counter and get a small plastic shot glass and a cocktail stick and put some olives in and go to offer the guy the glass. he holds up both arms and shows his hands are full with bags - he then proceeds to open his mouth up, indicating he wanted me to feed him the olive. i was kind of shocked and didn't really know what to do, i wanted to avoid conflict with the customer and have him go away so i just used a cocktail stick to get an olive and held it out towards him - he then ate the olive off the stick but let his mouth close round my fingers - it was honestly one of the most disgusting things that has ever happened to me and for ages after i could still feel the wetness of his mouth on my fingers - i must have scrubbed my hands a million times	639	23706	bm8dfx	emv5e1j

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"when i was in elementary school, i hated using the public bathroom, and would always use the nurses bathroom instead. she was nice and understood this. however, one day i needed the bathroom and she was not around, so i let myself in. shortly afterward, the nurse came back with a student and begun feeding him with a stomach tube. i was horrified. i realized that this was a closely guarded secret and decided to wait in the bathroom for it to end, hoping to sneak out later. but very shortly after it ended, more and more students with secret medical needs kept coming, and the hole kept getting deeper and deeper. finally, after an hour and a half in the bathroom, i walked out. the nurse gave me a horrific glare, and the student looked just as uncomfortable as i felt. when i got back to class the teacher yelled at me in front of everyone for being gone so long, and i panicked/lied by yelling at the top of my lungs ""i had diarrhea!"". all the kids in class laughed at me, and the part that sucked was that i now knew most of their embarrassing secrets."	651	23706	bm8dfx	emv4c7z
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	there was a bridge that was closed off for works so you had to walk around to go underneath it. i had walked underneath and come out the other end when a woman with a guide dog approached me. she said something like how do you get over the bridge? whilst looking me directly in the eyes, so i thought oh, she can see. occasionally i see people training guide dogs around here so i thought she was too. so i said you just go round there, over that bit and head that way whilst pointing. but no, she turned out to be blind.	290	23706	bm8dfx	emuqubk

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was new to the army, i met some people in airborne school, and they invited me to go to new york city with them on leave. i had never been there before, having grown up in a small town, well south of the mason-dixon, in a family without the money or desire to travel to a place like that. of course, i jumped at the chance. the drive up there was fantastic. we all took turns driving, had all the best cd's (this was early 2000's, so cd's were a thing), and lots of snacks. it was a fun road trip. then we arrived, and as it turned out, we were going to be staying with one guy's parents. um. i had been told about all the friends we were going to see, did not expect we would be staying with the parents, much younger siblings, etc. oh, and i was the only female person on this trip also, so i got instant suspicion from the mom of the guy who coordinated the whole thing. i'm just there, like, 19 years old and wanted to see nyc on leave after learning how to jump out of airplanes, ok?? the worst part was that we were stuck there for like four days, staying at this guy's parents' house, and they would have huge arguments, some of which were about why he brought me there, and i really wanted it to be over after about the first couple hours. it was easily the most awkward experience of my life.	933	23706	bm8dfx	emuvbbg

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i've told this story once before, but when i was around 10 years old i was sleeping over at my best friend juan's house. we usually stayed up really late playing and would sleep in until like 11 or 12, which i loved because i rarely got to do that at my house. at about 8 am his dad comes into the room and tells me to get dressed because he needed my help. his dad was a big drinker, so either his breath reeked of beer from last night or he had one for breakfast, either way he was a bit buzzed. he tells me he needs my help picking out a toy for juan as a surprise and we were going to drive to walmart. so we get in the car and drive down to the wal-mart which was like 10 minutes away from his house. it was a pretty awkward ride and he starts asking me questions to make small talk, like how i was like school and if i had a girlfriend yet. we get to the walmart and he takes me to the you section and asks me what toy i think juan would like. i walk around and see darth vader's tie fighter. juan and i were huge star wars fans and even went to go see empire strikes back in theaters when it was re-released, so i knew he would like it. he buys the toy and then we have another awkward car ride back. he thanks me for helping and asks me to keep it a secret. i changed into my pajamas again and tried to go back to sleep, but about 10 minutes later his dad comes in and surprises him with the toy and gives me a wink. i found out a few years later that the reason he had me go on this mission to get the toy was because he had been really drunk a couple of nights ago and hit juan and he wanted to make it up to him. as far as i know that was the only time that ever happened, but i don't really know since we lost touch after 8th grade. it was just a such a strange and awkward morning.	653	23706	bm8dfx	emv3uzf

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my wife and i decided to go on a date night with my brother and sister-in-law. this was our first time really hanging out as a foursome, and i was looking forward to build the relationship, since i didnt really know my sister-in-law that well. we decided to go have dinner about an hour away. my brother drove, and we all rode together and had a nice meal. not wanting the night to end, we decided to go to a club near the restaurant. the club was not what we expected, which ended up being sort of a plus. we were definitely all out of our element and it gave us something to experience together. we were all laughing and joking around and having a good time. some stranger (female), who also was out of her element, made a passing comment to me and my brother like this is pretty interesting and my brother responded with something benign like for sure. wow. never in my life would i expect to see a single, polite response to a strangers passing comment launch the rage of a thousand burning suns, but let me tell you. it did. it was a pretty low-key place, so every head turned when my sister-in-law came charging at my brother in the middle of the place, raining down a barrage of insanity that i could barely comprehend. why dont you go sleep with that girl?, who is she? a girlfriend of yours?, whats her name? huh? whats that girls name?, etc. laced with way more profanity and vulgarity. now, afterwards it seemed clear that there were some deeper problems there. clearly some trust issues. maybe some past issues? who knows. what i do know is this. two hours. they fought in the middle of this place for two hours. they were our ride home. this was before uber, in a small town without taxis. we were an hour away from where we live and there was no one to call to come get us. it was the middle of the night. it wasnt until the establishment finally called the cops, and the police came and told her that she had to leave, that we finally left. and rode home. in silence. for an eternity-long hour. i saw my brother a few days later and he was all bruised and cut up. she drove them home from our house and my brother legit jumped out of the moving car because he couldnt listen to it anymore. that was like 10 years ago, and they are still married and i hear this is a pretty common sort of thing for them. good times.	56	23706	bm8dfx	emw0ngk
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was 19 (f) and moving for college out of my local town. a few months before i had watched football with a guy friend of mine and too make it more entertaining we would switch to porn during commercials. this was well before smart phones and easily accessible porn and i asked to borrow a few after the game as i enjoyed porn. months later im moving and my family (super conservative christians) is there helping me pack up. i had put the dvds in a box in the back of my closet and never watched them or thought of them after that. my dad was in my room supposed to be helping with the heavy stuff and i hear my name yelled loudly. dad: abby! (not real name) me: yeah what do you need? dad: what the hell is this? (holding box with cum guzzling teen porno clearly showing) me: *crickets* dying inside vision tunneling dad: well? me: its not mine i swear i have no idea dad: no father should have to catch their daughter with disgusting material like this (holding up dvd titled daddys little girl) me: immediately grabbed said box and pitched in dumpster. blacked out memory of rest of the day packing. edit: wow silver! thanks awesome stranger!	566	23706	bm8dfx	emv2dx2

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	me and my co workers used to get lunch together. one day they went without me and it went on like that for months which is currently still happening. i dont really care but it did hurt at first. it still hurts when they talk about where to eat next when i next to them. anyway, it was december. the managers had put table together to make a long line in the break room for a christmas party. i was eating there then suddenly the same co workers came to the break room and sat around me. 2 of them had just came back for a soda shop and gave everyone a soda cup except for me. i was just sitting there in the middle being quiet my phone had died so i just played with my food quietly. no one spoke to me. it was very uncomfortable and awkward. and these are just kids the same age as me high schoolers. today, im currently trying to change positions because of them	263	23706	bm8dfx	emv3nfn
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this will probably get buried. not even gonna use a throwaway. so i was a freshman in hs. i forget what the situation was, but basically i had the house to myself in the morning before school. i had also recently discovered some porn that was on on demand through our cable. well, one morning, i decide im gonna enjoy some of that porn before school. pop it on, so my business, done. time to get ready for school. put on clothes, remember from previous times that sometimes after i cum, some leaks out a bit here and there for a couple minutes after. i dont want any to get on my boxers for school. no problem, just pop a rag in my boxers as some sort of cum catcher, right? genius, obviously. rest of the morning goes smooth, catch the bus, on my way to school. get to school, get my stuff from my locker, head to class. walking to class and what do i feel? the rag. its now on its way out of the bottom of my shorts. i dont wanna pull it out, that would be too obvious. so i just walk a little faster. i feel it fall out the bottom of my shorts. extremely embarrassed. i dont even look behind me or around me to see if anyone noticed. just keep my head down and keep walking. pretty sure my face was super red when i made it to class. i was a super shy, awkward kid, with few friends as it was. no one ever said anything or made fun of me for it. so maybe i got lucky? either way, the most embarrassing situation ive ever been in.	131	23706	bm8dfx	emvf7wm
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i was a horny high schooler really enjoying the perks (sex) of being in a relationship. one night i sneaked into my girlfriend's room through her ground level window in order to pork her and pork her i did. after about 10 minutes we hear her dad's door open which is the next door over caddy corner to her room, i hide under the covers and he comes in. she denies me being in there but it's so obvious because i'm a human sized mass under the covers. she says to just come out, the jig is up, but i just stay under the covers (kinda like how you do when you're scared as a child) hoping it will all go away. after some more urging i finally emerge from the sex tent, zip my pants up, and walk right past her dad while muttering ""sorry, sir"" and then run to my car and drive home wishing i was dead."	133	23706	bm8dfx	emvo063
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	back in high school my friend and i went to pick up some speakers i had found on craigslist from a dude in a town about 45 minutes away. during the drive over my friend was doing dumb teenager shit like making weird ass faces at people we passed on the highway (picture sunglasses and skewed hat with the face pressed against the window). i was driving so not doing this but actively encouraging it. one of the people we did this to was a guy and kid in an older truck. when we arrived at the address for the speakers i texted the person that we were there and he responded saying he was almost back. he pulled up a few minutes later and of course it was that guy from the truck. i cringed remembering this.	43	23706	bm8dfx	emv89wb
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i work for a cable/internet service and i had an install at an apartment that is known for temporary housing where apartment is completely furnished and they give us the key to go in and do the install and when all done stop back to the office and return the key. welp i was given the wrong key and ended up in the wrong apartment. i unlock the door and enter. as i'm looking around i'm thinking ok they must have already moved in. there is open soda cans, beer cans, pizza boxes etc. i get to the entertainment center and already see equipment installed. i check my work order and as i realized i'm in the wrong apartment i hear the door starting to unlock and here enters a young lady before she had the door open i announced i'm from the cable company and she's like what the hell? how did you get in? i think i was more fearful than she was. as i'm explaining i got the key from the office my voice is shaky i'm shaky and she's more pissed that the office gave me the wrong key. i apologized and gave her my supervisor's number and called him to explain. she stated she wasn't going to call him but ended up doing so. now anytime i have an install at those apartments i also have a leasing agent with me during the duration.	44	23706	bm8dfx	emvl4xs
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i had the cringe-est first date once. date received tickets to some play. we had no idea what it was but cool. we go. were super high and had a few beers. turns out its a kids play. audience is kids and parents. were the only people without kids there. so you can imagine the production is kind of hokey. anyway we get a fit of the giggles cannot. stop. laughing. parents are shooting daggers at us. main actor actually looks out at audience bc whos the assholes laughing like idiots. omg i was cringing so hard but couldnt stop laughing. ok so well leave at intermission. kids show so its only 40 minutes long and no intermission. we finally noped out of there but it was so embarrassing! dude, why didnt you ask more questions about these tickets??? its hard to describe the cringe factor to eleven but man, it was bad! anyway somehow i gave him another shot. married almost a decade now.	166	23706	bm8dfx	emvl1uj
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was in a reserve infantry battalion in the uk (ta). each year we had to do a two-week training session. one year we did it at a regular army barracks not far from where my grandparents lived. on the middle sunday we were allowed the evening off and headed into the local town for some 'entertainment'. me and my mates wound up quite drunk looking for something to eat. found the only place open - a nice looking restaurant. we were very loud and very obnoxious. especially to the female servers. we were lucky not to get kicked out. the very next weekend after was my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary. it was apparently being held at a swanky restaurant. you know where this is going right . i rode up with my parents and brothers and i quickly realized the streets were disturbingly familiar. we pulled into the car park and i knew exactly where we were. at least two of the servers had been working the night i was there drunk out of my skull. lots of giggling and pointing. my dad says 'i think she likes you.'	86	23706	bm8dfx	emv427h
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?

""did you poop in your diaper?"" and i kept slamming the door. ater 5 minutes a teacher came out of that room and i instantly started crying. she was extremely mad wich made me cry even more. and i sware when i saw her angry teacher face coming out of that door my hart just dropped. it looked like my brain was freezing. and yeah it was pretty awkward ps. sry for my shitty english im from germany."	219	23706	bm8dfx	emv3ix8
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was at my friends lake house when i was younger (maybe 13 or 14), and i was on my period. my applicators were in the trash can in the bathroom. my friends toddler brother decided to go through the trash can and put the applicators he found in his mouth. my friends parents had to ask everyone (we were there with my entire soccer team) who was on their period. i was the only one who was, or at least fessed up, and they asked me if i was sexually active or if i was dealing with any issues down there in front of everyone to make sure their son would be ok.	41	23706	bm8dfx	emvmi24
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was in college we used to hide in a friends bathroom when everyone was leaving the pregame. once they left wed all go back and rearrange their furniture. this time i was picked to hide in the shower while everyone left. then a chick walks in and proceeds to shart all up in the toilet. then 2 of her friends come in, one of whom sits on the edge of the bathtub, with me behind a curtain. they then opened the curtain and saw me, ran out screaming. i was fucked	38	23706	bm8dfx	emvwcp8
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i got my hair cut by someone else because my main girl wasn't there. she fucked it up. i went to get it fixed by my main girl, who ranted about what the last girl did to my hair. took her a while to fix. the other stylist has the chair beside her and was there the entire time and heard everything.	46	23706	bm8dfx	emvy6te
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was in the army and deployed to afghanistan we had an overnight mission to march through the mountains to this isolated village that hadn't seen a military patrol pass through in years and years. we'd gotten intel that a platoon-sized group of taliban were hiding there, so we had to go do a sweep through the village to be sure. we leave in mraps just before dark, pile out on the closest stretch of road to the village and hike the entire night. we get there maybe an hour after the sun comes up and decide to drop our packs and set up our machine gun teams before going into the village, in case there are actually bad guys there and shit goes down. i go to sit down for a minute after dropping my pack and the second i plop down my pants rip all the way from my right knee up almost to my belt. i didn't wear underwear on patrol because it always bunched up, got soaked in sweat and chaffed me like crazy. so now my dick and balls are just hanging completely out in the open as we patrol through this mountain village. the first americans they've seen since the initial invasion back in 2001 and i'm flashing my junk to everyone while their kids are running around. turns out the intel had been complete bullshit and we went out there for no reason, to boot. which was kind of evident when the first guy whose house my fireteam stopped outside of offered us tea despite my balls hanging out right in front of him.	44	23706	bm8dfx	emw0bhu
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this was like 7 years ago. we were dancing at my summer camp and i had very loose shorts on. i tried to do the worm and failed miserably, everyone laughed at me. i grunted then i charged at 30 people thinking i was john wick and my pants fell down.	113	23706	bm8dfx	emuzpp2
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	yesterday, one of my classmates went to high five one of our fellow students, who is blind. she just walked up to him and held her hand out for an awkwardly long amount of time, before taking her hand back and saying, ill high five myself then. the other student then realised what had happened and he said, i cant see. im blind. everyone was kind of dumbfounded that she: a) hadnt picked up that hes blind (he uses a stick to get around, has been featured in the schools newsletter, and also has a seeing eye dog) and b) just walked up and expected a high five without knowing or speaking to the guy first. watching, we honestly had no idea what to do. like, do you slap her hand down and tell her hes blind? were we supposed to tell her hes blind or were we supposed to let him say something? it was so awkward, but i still chuckle when i think about it because part of me is evil and it seemed like something out of a comedy movie.	34	23706	bm8dfx	emvh71e
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	an ex girlfriend convinced me to thrust my crotch against this really huge ass teddy bear while she watched just so she could laugh. her dad walked in and saw what i was doing.	38	23706	bm8dfx	emvic93
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my parents and i walked into an open house. they had a sign out front and even a sign in the house telling you to take your shoes off before entering. we slowly wonder why no one is inside. the owner finally sees us and gets startled. the open house was for the day after. we were casually walking in some person's house. so embarrassing.	34	23706	bm8dfx	emvn99k
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i started getting erections really young, like 10 years old or so. as a kid i thought nothing of it, i didn't even know what erections were so i assumed it was standard procedure. on weekends my morning routine was pretty standard, i'd wake up around 730, and head into the kitchen to eat breakfast with my mom and my brother. around the same time as my newfound morning erections started happening, we also happened to adopt a dog that my mom's coworker didn't have the time to properly care for. he was a pretty chill dog, a black lab/chow mix, he was only 6 months when we got him. one sunday morning i walked out into the kitchen in my pajamas, which were essentially a pair of insulated underwear since it gets cold af in the midwest. i'm sporting some pretty vicious morning wood, and my brother instantly starts cracking up, he's 5 years older than me. my mom is trying to hold back laughter while simultaneously trying to get my brother to stop teasing me. i'm standing there confused and sleepy, when this fucking dog walks right up to me, sniffs my cock, and chomps down like it was a fucking sausage link we dropped on accident. i spent the next few hours in the doctor's office, with some stranger examining my package and reassuring my mother that morning wood is totally normal for boys my age. i had never been so embarrassed in my life.	36	23706	bm8dfx	emw2ur0
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was hitchhiking across the us. which is awkward enough. some guy picked me up and half way through about a 20 minute drive down the road he decided to start talking about religion. okay cool, happens enough, most people try to convert you and such while hitching. this guy took another route by telling me about how everyone thinks islam is a religion of violence and what have you. no, he wanted me to know it was a religion of peace. by yelling it to me at the top of his lungs for 10 minutes.	474	23706	bm8dfx	emuq7p3
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was in some roleplay game with 2 brothers and one of them was the 'game master'. he kept making weird shit happen to the other. pissing while being passed out, leading to a bamboo growing up his ass, then due to immobility getting robbed. meanwhile he kept making my character either offset or unconscious. i was just sitting curled up in the corner of the couch, watching and confirming my suspicions of my then boyfriend's brother having weird fantasies. very weird fantasies.	177	23706	bm8dfx	emuxdir
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was at a treatment center when i was 18. made a holocaust joke, the older gentleman at the end of the table with the numbers tattooed on his arm was less than appreciative.	72	23706	bm8dfx	emv8bt9
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my parents divorced when i was 10 and my father's family completely disowned me and my mother but not my younger brother. thirty years later i attended my brother's wedding and the whole family was there. not only was it awkward just to be there (i am close with my baby bro so did it for him) a whole bunch of these lovely relatives were insulted when i could not identify them. the last time i saw you i was 10, you shits.	74	23706	bm8dfx	emvc2pl
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	to preface i am catholic and have a healthy sense of humor. i was in room with about 7 people i didnt know when i was in college and we were having a tell your best joke competition. my turn i tell this one- a rabbi and a priest are driving down a road and they see a little boy riding his bike. priest says we should fuck that kid rabbi says outta what? turns out every person in the room is jewish and no one laughed. i wanted to kill myself.	71	23706	bm8dfx	emvo2xn
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	having to apologize to my girlfriends father in person by myself at their doorstep for leaving a hickey on their daughters neck. we were one month into our relationship at the time and i barely knew the guy, so i was unsure how he would react. all i knew was he was a traditional kind of guy and the last thing i wanted to do was avoid him for as long as i could so i decided to just own it and apologize to him for disrespecting him and his daughter like that. luckily for me, he told my girlfriend afterward he respected me a lot for the move, and weve been good ever since.	93	23706	bm8dfx	emv8qy6

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	lucked into a threesome with two girls i met at a party. we hit it off, they both were down, hell, they invited me over to make it happen. hooray! wasn't until after a 15 minute drive and clothes came off that i came to the realization that neither girl was particularly fond of each other, so, there was no point during the deed where both women were involved at once. i got one girl off, and she then got dressed and went downstairs, leaving me with the other girl. so, my only threesome was more alternating having sex with girls who i only learned afterward didn't really like each other than it was a scene right out of a porno.	94	23706	bm8dfx	emv1g4u
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	so when i was at school i was talking to this girl and i leaned back in my chair and my head hit a bookshelf and all the books fell out and hit me.	65	23706	bm8dfx	emv5hpg

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was a kid, i thought a guy in the street was my older brother so i jumped on his back and covered his eyes. the man freaked out, just as i realised it was not in fact my brother. i tried to run off, but he held onto me. maybe thought i was a thief.? i felt so awkward i started crying in the middle of the street whilst this random guy was stuck with a crying child and probably felt more awkward than i did.	31	23706	bm8dfx	emviw8d

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	first time ever getting drunk at a very large family social event (was about 16), i jokingly called one uncle a lying mother-fucker in conversation. he did not think it was very funny. he told the loudmouth aunt about my choice of words and fast-forward 10 minutes later the party turned into a giant family intervention about alcoholism while i sat miserably drunk and embarrassed in the middle of the room. never heard about it again after that night. still haunts me 6 years later.	30	23706	bm8dfx	emvr6y6
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	lost my virginity in the middle of a field for many reasons (lived in the boonies, boyfriends parents were conservative christian.), so the next day we decided to have another rendezvous in the same meadow. we put a blanket out under a tree and were a good mile or two from any houses or people. mid doggie-style (again, my first time doing this and second time ever), two middle-aged women approach on horseback. we only notice them when they call out to us to ask how we are and then stop mid-sentence with a horrified gasp. the two ladies start laughing hysterically, apologize, and ride off telling us they are sorry for interrupting. talk about a cock-block.	30	23706	bm8dfx	emvxmi4
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was like 15 yrs old my mom came to me and said she had a dream and we did it in it. i was like the fuck you saying why would you tell me about having sex with me in your dream? i thought to myself. so i said, well you didnt have to tell me that. and she was like why not? we both were on a stage, performing psychic show (shes into spiritual stuff) and we did it together. why wouldnt i tell you?. i just said i dunno. i dodged a bullet right there and i hope she didnt get anything out of my reaction.	120	23706	bm8dfx	emusvdk
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i accidentally bumped into a girl and touched lips with her when i was rushing to class down the stairs. we both just stopped and made a slight noise before looking at each other in shock and embarrassment then apologizing and wiping our lips off and rushing off. probably the only time in my life that i'll ever kiss a girl. even if it was an accident.	58	23706	bm8dfx	emvaao5
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	so im about 14-15 years old at sea world in ohio, back when that was still a reality. im with 4 or 5 buddies of mine, but weve split up and are all over the park. for a teenage guy, im not short or skinny. we get into the line at shark encounter, one of those flat moving walkways through a tunnel full of sharks in a tank. the line is slow moving. i start to feel the person behind me in line poking me in the lower back. my friends are dumb, so i assume its one from another group. im also nervous to react, so i dont turn around. but i keep getting poked. 2 minutes go by. not hard pokes, but consistent. and annoying. 10 more minutes of this and ive had it. i whip around and yell with a thunderous tell what do you think youre doing you little jerk! there should be someone at eye level. there is not. there is, however, a small girl, maybe 4 years old, who looks up towards me with tears and a terrified expression. the crowd is silent, stunned. so they can all hear her say. i thought you were my dad. through pained small child tears. how could she not tell? you ask yourself. well, she was blind. two questions i should have asked in that moment. 1.) wheres her dad? 2.) whys she in line at shark encounter? but those questions never come to mind, because all i hear is the entire line in unison saying boooooooooooooo. i look down, horrified, and say i am so sorry. i then run out of the line to a chorus of boos, and sit in the back row of the shamu pavilion for the next 3 hours reconsidering my life choices.	59	23706	bm8dfx	emvbbbq

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	so a couple of my friends and i where at a block party in college. after stopping by a few friends houses we walked into a different party next door. i should note that my friends and i are all white and have relatively short hair, couple of them have shaved heads. this new party was apparently being held by a bunch of the defensive players at the school, who were coincidentally all very giant black dudes. we walked in, the music stopped, everyone turned and looked at us and we just slowly backed out of the house. fun times	27	23706	bm8dfx	emvn7uw
what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i was camping with a bunch of friends and i went to bed in the tent some of us were sharing. my friend came in to go to bed or so i thought, that is until i heard him making out with someone. at the time i thought ""oh god this is awkward i shouldn't say anything they're like 5 feet away from me"". however hindsight is 20/20 and i should have said something. it got much worse, i heard a zipper go down and my stomach dropped. for the next 15 minutes i heard the noises go from muffled moaning all the way up to sloshing and the occasional queef. they finally finished, the lady left and i asked my friend ""how was that it sounded like you had a lot of fun"". i kind of scared him since he thought i was asleep and a couple seconds later he burst out laughing. he still brings it up to me lol"	25	23706	bm8dfx	emvtar2

what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	probably not the most awkward ( i have a gift) but years ago i was a store manager for a large chain musical equipment retailer. i had a young man apply for a store credit card to purchase a new amp. he was pretty young and i doubted it would get approved due to lack of credit history but i ran the app and it was declined as i expected. so i went to shred the application as you do, and i happened to be holding his license in the same hand as the credit app i was feeding into the shredder. as soon as the paper shredder grabbed the application it yanked it out of my hand. along with his drivers license. everything went into slow motion as his drivers license flew in a perfect arc right into the hungry maw of the shredder and was instantly obliterated. so i had to let the customer know that not only was his application declined but i destroyed his dl. he was in disbelief when i explained what happened. he was not amused. i did offer a huge discount on the amp and he paid via debit but it was crunchy	23	23706	bm8dfx	emvxzxy

gamers of reddit, if you could remaster any game so it had today's graphics, which game would you choose?	"fallout 3. why? it's quite simple. i'm german. when fallout 3 was released, our government had several massive sticks up their collective asses about ""killerspiele"" ruining our children with all of the violence. as such, fallout 3 was censored before the german release. unlike literally every other censored german release ever, they somehow decided ""hey if this is just going to be released on the german market, obviously every single buyer will be happy with german voices and text"". so fallout 3 is 100% german, and i can't even fix it, because technically speaking i don't own the english voice files, so downloading them separately would count as piracy. new vegas had the same problem, but when it got rereleased as a goty edition, it was fixed. fallout 3 just needs a re-release and i can finally enjoy it properly!"	21	21751	bmhwr8	emxk7vo

what was your schools huge scandal?	my school district gave all high school students laptops that they could bring home with them to use for school work. they could also remotely activate the webcams and spy on students (although of course they didn't tell us this). one kid got caught smoking weed this way while he was in his room at home and i think was going to get suspended. he sued the district in response for invasion of privacy and won the case. it got national media attention for a little while	2125	18722	bue7cv	epbwpmp
what was your schools huge scandal?	the assistant principal died in a car accident. there was a big, somber school assembly in his honor. his wife said a few words, and then his 14-year-old daughter came to the microphone to say a few words. she sort of snapped and unloaded about how he was not a good guy, he was a monster who had been abusing her and her little sisters and using them for kiddie porn for years - and she was glad he was dead. i've never heard a room full of people grow so silent, so fast.	7343	18722	bue7cv	epbvkl5
what was your schools huge scandal?	everyones favorite teacher was in fact banging that student he always hung out with, who would sit in his lap and would visit him after she graduated. they could not have been anymore obvious. edit: for everyone asking this was a performing arts high school in san diego, from about 2005-2008. edit: i dont know if this is allowed but [heres](https://m.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/news-ticker/2011/dec/21/failure-to-report-student-teacher-sexual-relations/) a link with pertinent info. she got a $1.25 million settlement because no one acted.	6545	18722	bue7cv	epb818g
what was your schools huge scandal?	my high school districts's superintendent hired a relative who wasn't qualified for the job, increased the salary of administrators every year, used the district's credit card to buy meals, groceries, gas, personal electronics, and gift cards. when the state audit went through they said that the overpay of administrators and the personal spending cost the school district around 1.1 million dollars. her husband was also an administrator. when she eventually got caught, she just retired and for some reason never faced federal charges. when she retired she had a $260,518 salary. my favorite part is that the state audit discovered that the district's credit card was used to purchase logging equipment the same month the superintendent's husband filed paperwork to open a timber company. everyone knew there was corruption in the school district, but no audits or investigations happened until someone was threatened by the superintendent's husband on facebook.	8705	18722	bue7cv	epb8wal
what was your schools huge scandal?	a year after i graduated hs, a woman was stabbed 40+ times with a pair of scissors while jogging on our track on a sunday. one of the guys in that years senior class wound up hanging around the track over the following days, obsessively pestering investigators with questions and theories, so naturally some suspicion fell on him. when the womans description of her assailant (she survived!) matched him spot-on, he was arrested, and both the scissors used and his bloody clothes were found at his house. dude was sentenced to 10+ years in prison. end of story, right? wrong. two years after the trial, the jailed kid is ordered released after his little brother, one year younger and a dead lookalike for his big bro, is popped for violent sexual assault on a woman, and confesses to the stabbing during questioning. turns out the older brother took the fall for him, falsely confessing so that he could keep his younger sib out of jail. dude never told anyone, but did admit the lie after his younger brothers arrest and confession. i knew both kids when i was a student there. both brothers were definitely thought to be weirdly intense, but their behavior was attributed to their military dads strict style of parenting, and not anything darker.	2262	18722	bue7cv	epbnjla

what was your schools huge scandal?	i went to a small christian high school that also had a middle and elementary school on the grounds. the principal of the high school had a child that was in my grade. one day he comes over the intercom and announces that he's stepping down from his position. he then goes on to talk about how he and the female gym coach had been having an 'emotional affair' for the last few months. this announcement goes through every speaker in all three schools. i remember everyone in my class looking over at his daughter who had a look a complete surprise on her face. from what i gathered this was the first time she was hearing about all of this. &#x200b; shortly after the gym teacher also left her position, but the most interesting part? the gym teacher had no idea this was going on. she was just doing her job and thought she was friends with everyone. the principal read more into their relationship and decided to go to the church with it and they made this decision. the gym teacher left her job out of shame and had to spend a lot of time explaining to her husband what exactly was going on. &#x200b; edit: adding information that others have asked about. the gym teacher's husband took a little time to realize that there was no actual affair that went on. after that they rumors and gossip in the area got to be too much and he ended up getting a different job pretty far away and moved them both to start fresh. &#x200b; the principal and his wife got a divorce within a day or so of the announcement. the wife got custody of all three kids, plus i think eventually their house and a fair amount of money. the former principal took a job selling either cars or furniture, i can't remember which, and pretty much faded from the radar. i don't think his eldest daughter had anything to do with him after all of that. i wanna say that she intentionally made sure he stayed away from her wedding.	6494	18722	bue7cv	epba3fc

what was your schools huge scandal?	there was a male and female high school pe teacher that essentially shared an office. they always got along really well, and kids would always joke that they we were dating. we were just dumb kids, so we never really thought anything of it. after a couple years, they both started acting weird around each other, and there were rumors that he left his wife and kids for this pe teacher. this wasn't actually true though. what actually happened was they added on a bedroom to their house and the pe teacher moved in. the kids pretty much just had two moms and everyone got along wonderfully. it was strange for about a year, and then it was business as usual. i guess they're going on about 15 years strong.	6309	18722	bue7cv	epb7wil
what was your schools huge scandal?

what was your schools huge scandal?	a girl in my year lied about having a sexual relationship with a teacher (in gross detail might i add). we all knew that she was straight up crazy and was making it up, but the school board obviously had to take it very seriously and the teacher was fired. worst part was that the teacher's wife was also a teacher at the school, and so, even though she wasn't fired, she pretty much had to leave her job as well. the school board eventually figured out the girl was lying and offered both teachers their positions back, but they both declined.	14845	18722	bue7cv	epb5ysi

what was your schools huge scandal?	a girl in my grade died of a brain tumour a week before the year 12 formal. they buried her the day before the formal. it was fucking horrific. the scandal wasn't so much with the school as with the local hospital - the fuckers had told her the migraines she was suffering were just normal stress symptoms, so they didn't pick it up until just before she died. she passed while on the plane to a hospital in the nearest major city. less than a year later, a teacher also got brain cancer. before that, the fittest and smartest man i've ever met. like, crazy healthy. a few other students and teachers have had cancer in the years since, and it's not a big town, so it's a bit weird. there's a part of me that's surprised there hasn't been a scandal about a cancer cluster tbh.	1235	18722	bue7cv	epbflsp

what was your schools huge scandal?	there were two teachers at my school who were in their late 20s early 30s who were married. the husband cheated on her with another teacher in her late 40s. their affair was known by basically everyone, they were even caught in the same car after a school excursion by passing students, they were on the same seat. eventually the wife found out and her office was right next to the mistress apparently and they moved them to opposite ends of the teacher offices. also the husband and wife kept teaching at my school for the entire time i was there and the husband wound up engaged to his mistress. apparently the principal was totally on the wives side and she got days off to prepare for court whilst the husband didn't. how do nearly all the students know all this? apparently teachers like gossiping as much as students.	3041	18722	bue7cv	epb1d7s
what was your schools huge scandal?	i recently learned that principal of a school i used to go to got fired. i was kinda glad because he was a dickhead. the reason he got fired? after communism was abolished in poland apparently if you wanted to have administrative job you had to sign a document that said you didn't work with communists. recently it came to light that he in fact did work with communists. &#x200b; edit: since this blew up a bit i did additional reading up on this. you have to declare if you worked with communist police which can mean anything from just being a low rank worker up to being a snitch for them. declaring you did work with the police doesn't disqualify you from the position but you have to be accepted by a public vote for the position. &#x200b; he's still working as a teacher. details about his work with the police are not released but since he's not in jail it wasn't anything bad. punishment for the fact that he decided to lie about this is being banned from administrative work for 3 years (max is 10) and of course instead of his public opinion will be that he probably is a shady person since he lied instead that of an honest person.	3678	18722	bue7cv	epb5snu

what was your schools huge scandal?	ill preface this by saying i went to a private christian school in mississippi which is a scandal in itself. when i was in the 6th or 7th grade, one of our coaches got fired and arrested for sleeping with a girl under age. problem was her mom found the messages from him to her and she denied it all. he is still in jail to my knowledge and she transferred schools. there was another coach doing the same thing and he just left our school. a few years later at a basketball game we were talking to some friends from that school about the whole situation and it turns out the coach that left was now coaching at the school we were playing. we unintentionally got him to leave that school as well. &#x200b; runner up: a girl got pregnant her senior year and was not allowed to come to classes but instead had to sit in the pa room and listen to her classes over the speaker and pa system. it was cruel and unusual and her classmates had a sit in to allow her to walk during graduation.	2022	18722	bue7cv	epbaqph

what was your schools huge scandal?	man i wish i wasn't so late to this party. around 1998, someone took a dump in a toilet at my high school. this turd was (no joking) the circumference of a coke can, and the length of a size 13 shoe. it was so big that it couldn't be flushed. this shit made it's way around the school quickly, and there was a line out the door to that bathroom for an hour at least before the facility caught wind. from what we heard, it took the janitor 4 flushes after breaking it down with a plunger. fast forward a couple weeks to the real aftermath. someone managed to take a picture of this turd and created a website dedicated to this mammoth shit. the person that made the site was dumb enough to use his name on the site and the school threatened him with expulsion if he didn't take the site down. he said no. so he had to go in front of the school board to make his case about how it's his right to have a website dedicated to a massive shit. this made the local news and made my junior year extremely funny.	738	18722	bue7cv	epcebaj

(i live in the deep south btw) long story short, the trip got banned and the teacher wound up stepping down after receiving so much hate for ""trying to make the kids muslim"" even though she was a white, christian woman. i went to a predominantly white high school, and all the white moms basically teamed up to complain to the school about her and tear her to shreds. i think the teacher is doing govt work now, she totally quit teaching after this. god i fucking hate my hometown"	165	18722	bue7cv	epcegcr

what was your schools huge scandal?	a 7 year old kid was found dead in the school's washroom, bearing brutal knife slashes on his throat. it was a national news for many many months during which the investigation was ongoing. initially it was claimed by the police that one of the bus drivers was responsible for the murder. he confessed of the same, a day later, claiming that he was going to sexually assault the kid but when he resisted, the driver killed him. but the kid's parents were not convinced that that was the case and claimed that the school was hiding a bigger conspiracy, since many of the evidence in the crime scene were tampered with before the police were notified and arrived on the scene. they pressured the government to involve the cbi and let them investigate instead of the local policemen. later on, giving in to the rising pressure from the whole country, including a supreme court ruling, the cbi was called in to investigate. the cbi are basically the indian equivalent of the fbi. during the investigation, the cbi found out that the driver was just a scapegoat and was forced to confess, which was claimed by other drivers since the very beginning. the driver later said that he was forced under police torture to admit to killing the child. as the investigation continued, it turned out that the murder was committed by a 15 year old kid, who apparently wanted to postpone the upcoming parent-teacher conference since the parents were gonna be notified of his recent bullying attitude towards his classmates. so this guy decided that the best way to get them delayed was for kill someone and cause a police investigation in the school. his name was never publicly announced, but the students obviously knew who the guy was. i knew him personally and i could never have guessed in a thousand years that that guy could do something like that. it's also unbelievably scary to think that he also almost got away with the murder. i don't know how the rules work in regards to this, so i don't know if i should post a link for a news report on this, but i'll do so it anyone asks for it.	278	18722	bue7cv	epceafe

what was your schools huge scandal?	"our it teacher was having a chat with a female student after class, about how he was concerned about how short she was wearing her skirt. he pointed and poked her leg just above her knee, saying that that was the school regulation on the minimum skirt lengths. obviously that sort of contact between a teacher and a student isn't appropriate, but he was a fantastic man, and he didn't mean anything by it. the girl wasn't even the person who got him in trouble. she apparently told her friend, and the friend made a big outrage about it. anyway, the teacher got suspended for a few weeks and was told to apologize to the girl. instead he offered to apologize in front of the entire school during assembly. i respect the hell out of him. it was a bad decision on his part, but it came from a good place and he handled the consequences head-on. edit: changed the word ""touched"" to ""poked"". i think people are getting the wrong idea about how he touched her. also, my school had a uniform, and they were very strict about dress lengths."	1029	18722	bue7cv	epc527h

"english teacher was a few mcnuggest short of a happy meal. her husband worked at a large chain grocery store as a manager (relevant later) and she talked about his work a lot because she was a boring woman nearing middle age teaching english in a town of 800 people. she used to go absolutely ballistic for little-no reason. 8th grader with messy writing? better belittle and berate him in front of his peers for 10 mins straight and then bitch at him for disrupting her class. someone coughs during an exam? better go off on a long-winded tangent about how disrespectful it was to make so much noise when their classmates were writing an exam that they were ""probably going to fail anyway"" stuff like that. this was in the early days of ipods, well before every kid had a smart phone. a few of us just start skipping all her classes. mostly fly under the radar, it's 8th grade and they were under a no-child-left-behind type mandate so even if there was something worth learning going on, we'd get a passing grade for existing anyway. one day, a friend tangentially part of our little circle of delinquents starts skipping class with us. suddenly the vice principal hauls him down into the office to give him the gears for skipping class. he breaks down about how he doesn't want to go to class because this woman was targetting him specifically for a lot of the most colorful screeching. he's told to go to class or he's suspended. he opts for suspension. his mom calls our parents and wants to talk to us (weird because we were the ""bad influence kids"" that she hated her kid being around) and asked us about what was going on and why we were all skipping class. we tell her. a few days later, she rolls up with a bunch of off-brand chinese knockoff ipods that have microphones in them. she tells us, go to class, leave these going on record in your desks and act normal. she gets them back from us, rips the audio to a dvd and goes to the school board. the next two weeks there's this old bald dude in a suit sitting in quietly in our classes. she's completely changed. he leaves, she goes back to her crazy self. new recordings are ripped, handed in and suddenly this whacko whose husband worked at a grocery store was moving to the other side of the country mid-semester because her husband is an rcmp officer transferring to a different detachment. bitch got canned."	209	18722	bue7cv	epbpb7u

what was your schools huge scandal?	we had a few actually. the biggest one was a huge fiasco where some news stations across the us thought it would be worth covering. every year at the first game each school in our district plays against each other in football, the bands trade a food basket if some kind. well one game our school gives a predominantly black school in our school district a fruit basket that contained a small watermelon. it by far wasn't the defining feature of the basket and wasn't meant as anything. just a member of the basket. well the band after the game was eating from the basket and a parent saw the watermelon and freaked out calling our school racist for giving their school a watermelon. she ended up calling a bunch of news channels and they came and reported on it. in the end all of the kids who gave the basket lost all of their scholarships for college for the next fall and some even had their offer of admission taken away. all because a mom thought a heartfelt gift was racist edit: to those searching and finding the story online. there was a pack of watermelon gum in the fruit basket with other packages of gum and candy. just clarifying that while there was more to the story there was also more not told. i just simplified it a little	3890	18722	bue7cv	epb5rmc
what was your schools huge scandal?	okay, so there was this random facebook account that popped up and started adding everyone from my high school (i had graduated a few years prior, but he was adding current and former students). and the account's first post was something basically saying if this girl that went to the school didn't apologize for what she had done, he was gonna shoot up the school. so school closed down for a day, but no arrests were made. so then the evening after school had been cancelled, this dude posts again, still demanding this girl apologize. and then he started posting provocative photos of her. it was close enough to christmas break that school just shut down a few days early. &#x200b; over break, things got progressively more nuts. this dude was threatening peoples' lives, demanding an apology from this girl that apparently did something to him, posting photos and videos of her, and also taunting the authorities that they couldn't catch him. and they didn't. several arrests were made (including the son of a manager that worked for me at the time), but everyone was let go. &#x200b; i think the height of it for me personally was when my wife and i were eating at a red robin across the street from our town's outdoor mall, and i saw a post from this random account that said he just found out the female student was at the mall, and he was on his way with guns and pipe bombs and stuff, and if she didn't publicly apologize, it was going to be a bloodbath. so from red robin, while i'm pounding this prime chophouse burger, my wife and i watch emergency vehicles rush to the mall. the guy never showed though. &#x200b; at some point, the posts just kind of stopped. and an arrest hadn't been made with the suspect being proven to be this guy. then several months later, there was a tumblr post where this guy was taking credit for the whole thing, saying he hacked a random girl's icloud account and did his social media terrorism from there. but i still don't think he was caught at that point (and i'm not even sure that he ended up being the culprit). a few months after that, the guy was finally arrested in california, and i remember reading that he was only caught because of some personal information he had put on an email account he had set up to use for this whole thing. &#x200b; but yeah, it was crazy that a random person could put an entire town on edge like that. i remember that for those few weeks, i just kept wondering what this girl did to upset the dude that bad.	925	18722	bue7cv	epb1c7o

what was your schools huge scandal?	kinda long but my junior year of high school we got a security cop, he was a real cop but he was just kinda there. we were a small school so there was never any issue that a cop would need to resolve. anyway he was kinda creepy on some of the girls and as i got into my senior year he got creepier. i was an office aid that year which was basically just helping stock stuff and running passes to kids in class but the officer usually hung out in the office too. he would always talk to me and the other girl that was an office aid and he would say the most creepy things and touch our shoulders and just made us feel very uncomfortable. we had heard other stories about him being really creepy on other girls so we decided to tell our principal, he didnt really say much and nothing happened with the officer. two years after i graduated i found out that the officer had sex with one of the students who was underage and the student filmed it. everyone found out about it and so did the principal but nothing was ever said about it, they didnt call the cops or anything. the officer the next day quit his job at the school and as a police officer and never got in trouble. im guessing the school didnt want the story attached to their name? pretty crazy for a town with only one stop light.	69	18722	bue7cv	epbtdyd

what was your schools huge scandal?	"oh boy. story time. once upon a time, mtv produced a reality tv show called ""[made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/made_(tv_series))"". each episode was about some teenager who wanted to self-improve in some way. maybe some kid wanted to become a cheerleader, or a dancer, or an actor, or an athlete, or whatever. mtv would set them up with a life coach / fitness trainer / tutor / whatever, and capture their progress as they were ""made"" into the better person they wanted to be. my classmate, ""beans"", had no such lofty ambitions. he was a total fuck-up. all he wanted to do was *graduate high school*. he had already failed at this (yup, he was a super-senior). mtv picked him. i still can't imagine why. so my whole senior year, mtv camera crews were roaming the halls of my high school, mostly following beans, but others were capturing other shots of the building and the students. beans had a mentor assigned to him. some tough-as-nails wannabe drill sergeant to push beans in the right direction. someone to get beans to study, stop partying, stop doing drugs, stop getting in trouble. beans didn't change one bit. he kept doing drugs, he kept partying, he kept getting in trouble, he remained a delinquent. he and his idiot friends even went out joyriding around town and bashing in mailboxes with a baseball bat. local police caught them. we'll come back to this later. despite the fact that beans legitimately should have failed his senior year again, the faculty caved to mtv's pressure and gave him barely-passing marks. beans walked last in the graduation ceremony so he would get an extra-big cheer. it was all dreadfully fake and cringey. a couple months after graduation, the episode aired. beans, stupid stupid beans, flat-out told the mtv camera that he had lied to the local police that night when he had been bashing in mailboxes. after the episode aired, and his self-incrimination made national television, *the police came back for him*. i don't know how it all ended (i moved on with my life and out of that town), but from the sound of things he was in deep trouble. he never stopped being a fuck-up. he never self-improved in any way. he never stopped being a druggie loser. and because of the legal ramifications, season 2 episode 4 of ""*made""* never made it to reruns, to the best of my knowledge. tldr; my high school's ""scandal"" was that it was the nexus of the lost episode of mtv's ""*made*""."	183	18722	bue7cv	epblc17

what was your schools huge scandal?	i got one that made the news. it happened one semester before my first. one of my professors relayed the story to my ootl ass, so i'll try to stick to how she told it. tl;dr at bottom. my university has a faculty union. around 10 years ago, they noticed the spike in university shootings and wanted to do something about it. at the time, all the buildings on campus had outside locks on their classrooms and each professor had a key. in an active shooter setting, professors would have to lock the door. that meant that they would have to step outside the classroom, find the key on their key ring, get it in the lock with their undoubtedly unsteady hands, and step back inside the classroom to close the door and block it. this, of course, is extremely dangerous. it's time consuming, puts the professor in immense amounts of danger, and by extension, puts the students in danger as well. if a shooter sees this, they can shoot the professor and stride in to massacre the students. the union decided that they wanted a solution: installation of simple lockable thumbturn deadbolts on the inside. that way, all they would have to do is close the door and turn the lock. no stepping into the path of a shooter, no fiddling with keys, nothing. the union approached the higher-ups with this idea and they were declined on the basis of expense. they asked the next year; nope, too expensive. they asked the next year. and the next. and the next. over a decade passed. finally, with the parkland shooting earlier in the year, something had to be done. if a shooter comes into a classroom, what would be the best item to use to defend yourself? well, ideally, a weapon, but the university has a no weapons policy. the next best thing? something small, heavy, easy to aim and throw, and guaranteed to stun them. something like a cue ball or.a hockey puck. with the help of some local businesses, the union bought over 2500 hockey pucks and distributed them across campus. students were told to keep them in their backpacks and to use them as a last resort against a shooter. while news outlets quickly picked it up and assumed that they were serious about using them to defend against shooters, there was a deeper purpose to them. each of them had a code on the back that would lead students to a donation page to purchase indoor locks. it was seized within the day. many outlets had articles about it, interviewing students, professors, campus police, etc., who all played along with their initial assumption. the message was clear: because they wouldn't protect us, we had to take our defense into our own hands. here's a couple articles: [https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/us/hockey-pucks-oakland-university-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/us/hockey-pucks-oakland-university-trnd/index.html) [https://www.wxyz.com/news/ou-professors-trained-to-fight-active-shooters-using-hockey-pucks](https://www.wxyz.com/news/ou-professors-trained-to-fight-active-shooters-using-hockey-pucks) and here's the snopes: [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hockey-pucks-shooting-defense/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hockey-pucks-shooting-defense/) the best part? when she found out, the university president was in a meeting with other university presidents across the state. she had no idea that the union's idea had been blocked for so long. the next day, when professors arrived, indoor thumbturn locks were being installed. tl;dr: frustrated union lets the country know that my university apparently doesn't have enough money to protect them from shooters.	55	18722	bue7cv	epc5ham
what was your schools huge scandal?	there was a kid in our hs who was popular but during a track meet he pooped his pants. the guy was 16 and everyone just saw a log roll out of shorts right as the whistle blew to start the race. it was like slow motion and everyone was at the meet. word got around and people bullied him for it. he began going to our alternative high school because of it. a few years later he hit me up on facebook wanting to go out on a date. i looked into him a bit more and it turns out he had also been accused of rape at the alternative school and was doing a lot of drugs. i think the bullying really messed him up.	49	18722	bue7cv	epcbcyd
what was your schools huge scandal?	(im not so good with words and english isnt my first language) when i first got into gymnasium (something like middle school and high school combined) there was a scandal where three dudes (13-14 years old) bought alcohol right before school at a spti (little store mostly owned by foreigners who dont really care) and got super drunk. well, one the dudes passed out in class and the school called 112 (911) . the ambulance came and that guy was flown to the hospital by a helicopter. (dont remember what happened to the others) after that there were some articles about the incident and the spti also got shut down. (reopened after two years lol) but beside that nothing major really changed.	260	18722	bue7cv	epbb5th

what was your schools huge scandal?	at our 6th year graduation, we all (parents, friends and teachers) go to the nearest pub about 5 minutes walk away. one of the student teachers (around 24/25) that a few people think was really good looking ended up getting a blow job in the bushes next to the pub from one of the girls that just graduated. we still had two weeks of school left after the gruadtion and our exams. that was fun times for a lot of us, not her though. edit: 6th year graduation is just before you go to college so everyone is about 18 years of age, and consent is 17 here.	97	18722	bue7cv	epbc4p8

what was your schools huge scandal?	ok so. we have a horse statue at our school that is super realistic (by realistic i mean it has a cock) and one day for senior prank someone painted the dick purple. so the janitors had to clean it and the only way they could is with some white soap. they had to run it back and forth to get all the paint off it so that's the reason why senior pranks are banned at my school.	50	18722	bue7cv	epbpf91
what was your schools huge scandal?	principle got accused of doing some inappropriate stuff by a girl who had been a student several years before. later it was found (she admitted) that she was lying and just mad about something else, but the guys whole life was still ruined. best teacher/ principle ive ever had, just a wonderful guy who devoted his life to teaching. he had to move away from his whole life and family and get some factory job in the middle of nowhere. he can never work in education again even though he literally didn't do anything. poor guy is probably about 70 now and hes still doing manual labor at a factory to make ends meet.	51	18722	bue7cv	epbs6a6
what was your schools huge scandal?	"i'm in college now, but one my friends is a high school senior. a few weeks ago this kid was mad about someone behind him kicking his desk, so he told the teacher he had to go to the bathroom. came back with diarrhea in his hands, threw it at the guy, but some of it missed and hit a few other students. the guy chased him down the hallway and beat him up pretty bad, but he was alright a few days later. so he got iss, and claimed to have learnt his lesson, but the next day he did the same thing, only this time it got all on the teacher, and he said ""fuck you. blah blah blah. cunt."" the police had to be called but he was not charged because he has mental issues. apparently there's way more insane things this kid has done but this story is the one i know is true."	46	18722	bue7cv	epbuv8z

what was your schools huge scandal?	"the lifetime movie ""the fab 5: a texas cheerleading scandal"" was based off mean girls i went to school with. &#x200b; edit to add details: basically, these five girls were terrible teenagers. the ""head cheerleader"" was the principals daughter and they were never punished for anything. they constantly drove their cheer coaches to quit or get fired. the main part of the scandal was they posted pictures on their myspace, in uniform, of them in a sex shop. under uil rules - this is grounds for removal from any after school sport but since it was the principals daughter they weren't punished."	93	18722	bue7cv	epc6f8j
what was your schools huge scandal?	the guy that taught gym class my freshman year of high school had chaperoned a school trip back in the late 80's where he slept with one of the students and got her pregnant. he ended up marrying her after she got out of high school (she was a senior when it happened and i believe 18.but still) and this guy was still able to teach until he retired after my freshman year. he was the biggest creep ever and was not surprised when i heard this story. there was a lot wrong with my school but it always really struck me as crazy he was allowed to remain, but after some of the other things that happened there when i was in school, nothing can really surprise me about that place.	42	18722	bue7cv	epbdwut
what was your schools huge scandal?	"there was a girl who was having sex for money with boys at my high school, and one day she and one of her ""clients"" went to a pizza place close to the school and proceeded to have sex in the bathroom. this was not the first time it apparently had happened there, but this time someone walked in on them. everyone found out, it spread through the school like wildfire and i believe she was expelled."	42	18722	bue7cv	epbkroj
what was your schools huge scandal?	this girl accused a teacher, who had been there for over 40 years, of sexual assault right before her entrance exam. it was a really good private school so you needed to take a test to be considered for admission. the accusations were investigated and were completely unfounded, but the actions of the school were even worse. they kept him in the dark for two months after the investigation was completed and were refusing to allow him back because of their insurance. then a campaign was launched by a bunch of alums and he finally got back to teaching, until his death a few years ago. he was a great guy too, i had him for a political theory class and he was really nice. he and his wife, aside from having children of their own, took in foster kids all the time and he did a lot of other volunteer work.	405	18722	bue7cv	epbcmqi
what was your schools huge scandal?	a few girls in my class was gonna leave school and not going to colleges or universities to join the jehovah's witnesses. this was because they attend some jehovah's witnesses meeting held by another girl's church. teachers, parents, the principal freaked the fuck out. they try convincing, talking some senses and then down right harassed the girls into reconsidering. all of them decided not to join and go to college.	78	18722	bue7cv	epbnajw
what was your schools huge scandal?	we had quite a few. the school has been burned down by students, twice, in 1997 and again in 2008. in 1991 a student stabbed another to death, that person was just released from jail. and the great school fights of 2007 and 2009, where like 50-100 student fights occured with dozens being suspeneded. a teacher was caught in 2016 with child porn, and was taking indecent photos of the students in the school, he had been teaching there for over 20 years. in 2013 a student high on 25i (synthetic acid) jumped off a balcony to his death after the school ball.	109	18722	bue7cv	epbcn9m
what was your schools huge scandal?	little late to the party but here it goes: the latin teacher at my school ran a school sponsored charity where they would pack backpacks full of canned food and school supplies for food-unstable elementary school kids. the program received funding through the high school. the principle removed money from the program and put that money into the football program to buy new uniforms. when the latin teacher found out, she took it public. the whole school knew about it. in response, the principle cut funding to the foreign language department and fired her.	80	18722	bue7cv	epcagr5
what was your schools huge scandal?	one young football player was found with the principal's daughter's nude photos on his phone, it was found out that he was not the only one to receive naked underaged pictures as half of the football team as well as many other guys had phones confiscated and looked through ended up being around 20 guys with various different pictures and videos. no charges were pressed but the principal made the whole school listen to an outside group to tell us how nudes aren't cool.	39	18722	bue7cv	epbc6iv
what was your schools huge scandal?	like 30 kids at my high school got suspended for making a twerk video on campus, during school hours, with school equipment lmao. one guy told a lot of girls he was filming a dancing through the eras video, and everyyyy girl just happened to be the twerk era hahahahaha	40	18722	bue7cv	epbt0dw
what was your schools huge scandal?	our latin teacher was already under suspicion for posting some risqu material on his facebook. students did a little more research and found out he was acting in male adult films. some of the students attempted to blackmail him into having sex with him upon discovering this. he ended up telling administration and stepping down to pursue his career as a gay porn star. it looked like it worked out well for him from what his twitter shows, hes traveling europe and has a huge following. last i checked he was doing some really kinky role play shit where he dressed as a dog and fucked the mailman, so that image was burned into my mind forever. as for the latin program at our school it was already very hard to find teachers and the few they found werent cutting it so all the students taking latin had to switch to another foreign language and we dont have the program anymore. since he was the only latin teacher a lot of his students got close to him and they still message him to catch up and for advice. honestly was a great guy but i dont think teaching at a high school was for him.	38	18722	bue7cv	epcaydp

what was your schools huge scandal?	i went to a catholic, all-boys high school. after i graduated i still heard some of the news of what happened in there because my state is pretty small. i think a few years ago, our disciplinary principal was hooking up with the daughter of the french teacher in the old irish christian brothers' residency. this sounds bad but what makes it worse is that the *last* sister who taught there was the one who caught them!! obviously she told staff and i believe both of them were fired from their jobs (the daughter was an english teacher i believe) and the disciplinary principal's wife divorced him afterwards. &#x200b; crazy shit happened there. bonus story: as a senior prank in the 70s/80s, the seniors managed to take one of the faculty's cars, disassemble it and reassemble it in the indoor gym. i'm pretty sure that's why we had a hard metal divider between the doors to the gym. my senior prank was dumb though. they took out all of the desks from one teacher's classroom on the second floor and installed an inflatable pool with some pool floats and toys scattered about. would've been a nice prank if the pool didn't leak all over the floor.	125	18722	bue7cv	epb2mha

what was your schools huge scandal?	war between the rednecks and lgbt students/allies. we were asked to wear purple during spirit week to represent an anti-bullying campaign. it also represents support of lgbt youth. a mass text went around saying to wear camo if you dont support the campaign. we knew it was going to be a mess the next day at school. it was an all out brawl, hordes of students wearing camo and punching/spitting on lgbt students and their friends. i got called to the principles office for calling a kid an asshole because he spit on the girl next to me (nothing ever came of it and i let the office have a piece of my mind when i got there). that was the only time i was ever called to the principles office in my life. looking back, it was absolutely insane. i cant believe law enforcement wasnt involved. school went on the next day like nothing happened. literally dozens of students were injured or spit on. this was 2011 in a rural virginia town.	61	18722	bue7cv	epbk5dl

what was your schools huge scandal?	i mean, that one student being arrested for the rape, torture, and murder of a former classmate was pretty scandalous, i guess. it took a while for any of the teachers to admit that he might actually be guilty, but it eventually became clear that he definitely did it. other things that happened that same semester: 3 students were injured in a hit and run with a stolen car, and only 2 of them survived. and the fan belt in the auditorium exploded at 7:30 on a monday morning in december, leaving all 2000 students standing outside in the freezing cold, huddling together for warmth because we weren't allowed to bring our coats outside if we weren't already wearing them when the alarm went off. all this in the first semester of 9th grade. my high school was kind of a piece of shit.	31	18722	bue7cv	epbmn7p

what was your schools huge scandal?	"in high school i knew this girl that liked to brag she was fucking the assistant principal. she told /everyone/ and we all just kinda brushed it off like ""yeah yeah sure"" because she was the type to say anything to get attention. i'm sure some teachers heard about it but thought the same thing, i'm serious when i say she told everyone. about a year after i personally heard about it and rolled my eyes it turns out they were fucking on the regs and had been since she was in 7th grade. the dudes wife apparently had suspected it but didn't have any proof, and then she overheard them talking on the phone and she hopped on his facebook to find pictures and detailed conversations about their hookups. why she waited years of suspicion to check his facebook if she had open access to it i'll never know. but the best part imo of this story is the local newspapers article on it. it, for some reason, randomly mentioned one of their hookups where he took her home after school that day instead of her riding the bus and she blew him in his car. at the end he offered her a travel sized mouthwash. i have no idea why this was so specified in the news article but i found it hilarious. he, of course, lost his job, lost his wife and kids, and i think he went to jail but i'm not sure. we all knew she was doing it and noone seemed to care because she bragged about it instead of like. seemed traumatized or upset, she was totally willing through the whole thing so i'm not sure what happened as far as charges being pressed and all that. i'm sure her parents freaked out and tried to send him away forever but because she was consenting even under the age of consent the legal stuff got messy really quickly and i stayed the heck out of it."	31	18722	bue7cv	epbslgc
what was your schools huge scandal?	my teacher was caught sleeping with a student in the back of his car. to make it worse, her husband also worked at the high school and they had small children. she was exposed and vanished from the school/city without any prosecution because the student was 18. my senior year i had her husband as my teacher and while he was teaching statistics his example for the lesson was the probability of your wife cheating on you.	31	18722	bue7cv	epcdgca

"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	asking people about their plans to have children. i'm only 21 and i am sick to death of being asked 'what will you do when you have your own kids?' or 'you'll understand when you have a baby'. nobody ever considers that i never want children, and god forbid i mention that fact to anyone because then i'm a monster. if people want kids, great, good luck to them, they'll make amazing parents i'm sure. but i won't - i don't want kids and i don't see how that is anyone else's business, or why people feel the need to try and change my mind. it's also incredibly intrusive and insensitive too. edit - wow this blew up while i was asleep, thanks for the silvers!	3173	25561	bltmmq	ems40k5

"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	5-day school routines. when i went to community college, i had tons of paperwork and studying. it was ati hcp and was extremely dense amounts of material. we had fridays off to study, tested on monday, clinical/hospital all day on thursday. really, lecture was only tuesday and wednesday. the more i think about it, the more energy i had to go to class & participate because i *actually* felt rested and prepared. the semesters *flew* by. it went sooo quickly! i loved it. i didnt have boredom because the lectures moved fast. i enjoyed taking my time all weekend and still having time for church. it was great. im not sure what the public school system believes what exactly they need to pull off anymore. everything is changing so much, that i dont know how much time they need in a week. but, the older you get, the more it seems to be this: priorities fall back on your own free time, anyways. you dont really learn in class as much as write/type or something like that. my opinion in college was that they simply read the lecture & ask if theres questions. they also point out priorities for people to learn and explain assignments. as soon as you get home, you have to start teaching it to yourself, really. sometimes time in class feels like a waste because. ultimately, you have to learn it on your own through memorization. it also made me think that really there are a lot of students who struggle with applying themselves with homework. if monday through thursday moves that fast with that heavy of material. theres not really a choice but to be responsible on friday. it actually totally teaches self-discipline and accountability. its amazing what you can pull off when you just dont have any choice but to pull it off.	27	25561	bltmmq	emsdfzf

"wrote software for a large, interactive art piece. it was presented in such a way that it encouraged self-discovery of how it was used, but it wasn't difficult and most people picked up on the main operation of it very, very quickly (as it should have been). there were three stations that interacted together but separated by some distance. i see some guy very flamboyantly operating the device (it created music, lights, and fire) and explaining how it works to a small crowd around him. i'm intrigued so i walk over to hear him. he's ""figured"" it all out and basking in the adulation of those around him. but, he's wrong! like, way off. so, after listening a bit, i gently, and politely, point out how it differs from what he is saying. he looks around at ""his"" crowd, and tells me i'm way off and don't get it; that i just don't understand. this is more perplexing because simple operation and observation contradicted what he was stating. anyway, i again, politely, explained a bit more to further illustrate where he was wrong. he told me i just didn't know what i was talking about. i hesitated and considered just thanking him and walking away but then thought better of it. i looked at him and told him i wrote the software for what he was doing, and had been writing and running it on my laptop at home every night for the last 6 months. the crowds attitude changed, people thanked me, and i wandered off. it was weird how invested that guy was in being right and the center of attention. at least he was polite at the end."	593	44253	bkkoq2	emhpgk5
whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	i work in lightning protection here in the states. i do the estimating and the designs for the largest company in the southeast. have for going on 7 years. certified through our industry's certification company. the amount of engineers and architects that love to argue with me about the code is astounding. i live that code. being i estimate and design systems, my main job is to know that code. the worst was the army corps of engineers. we had a project that their designer designed that was in the bid package drawings. pretty standard, pick out the materials requested and ignore the incorrect design. that is how we bid it, won it, and designed it. this would have provided them with a fully certified system. in our business, a u.l. master label certification is as close to a requirement for every job as anything can be. two weeks after we submit our design it comes back with a revise/resubmit stamp and a very snarky demand from the corps that we change our design to the one provided in the bid package. i went back and forth on email and calls with the engineers trying to explain to them that their system would not work, was potentially a dangerous hazard, and ultimately could not be certified or warrantied. the came back basically with we don't care what you say, we know better, do it. so i did. designed exactly like they had and put a disclaimer on the drawing saying there would be issues and we were not responsible. a few months go by, its installed and ready for certification. they call the inspector out and he fails it without even getting on the roof. the army is pissed and tried to come back at us. i politely forward the countless email chains to the officer in charge. now they scramble to get it up to code. as a consequence it resulted in us issuing a change order to bring it up to code that was around 75% of the original cost of the project. edit: this has also now been posted at r/maliciouscompliance. so go show the love over there and thanks for the advice. thank you for the silver!	6185	44253	bkkoq2	emhp906

whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	a new house gets built next door to mine, and shortly after the owners move in, they knock on my door to complain that my house is built too high. i explain that my house was/is built on flat ground and their builder has built their house lower, and undercut my fence. the guy proceeds to give a long winded spiel about how earthworks are done and my house is too high and i have to fix it. i then explain that i do earthworks for a living, have done the earthworks for 300+ houses in my suburb alone, and around 1200 in the local area. i name his builder, site supervisor, engineer, the exact floor levels in the street, and the law that says that he has to pay to fix my fence. he still hasn't paid, and legal procedures are beginning soon. edit1: earthworks in this case is the removal of topsoil and any mud/clay/organic matter from beneath where the house is going to go, and replacing it with clean compacted sand, trimmed dead flat to within 10mm. edit2: because his block was lowered and leveled to suit his engineer, he is responsible for retaining the land around him, which is now higher than his. edit3: i was prepared to let it slide, because his place being lower now helps my drainage in heavy rain. but when he wanted me to pay for his retaining wall responsibility, and would not pay for his half of the fence, i decided that i had enough bluster and bullshit. time to pay up.	13569	44253	bkkoq2	emhq35t

"in the netherlands we have different sized glasses for our pilsner. they all have a different name. the smallest, 0,18l is called a flute (fluitje), the middle a vase (vaasje) and the large, 0,5l we just call ""half a liter"" or pint. sometimes the bar has a medium of 0.33l as well, that doesnt really have a name. anyway, most people drink flutes or vases. you'd order ""a flute, please"" or ""a vase, please"" and you'll always be served the house pilsner (moest well know one is heineken, of course) in the size you ordered. &#x200b; as you might have guessed by now, i am a bartender. i was at work in a bar and had a group of 5 dudes drinking vases, a lot of them too. thing is; is you order ""a beer"", you'll be served a vase of pilsner as a standard. everyone knows this, it's common knowledge (in the netherlands) and noone ever objects to it. these dudes had been ordering ""5 beers, please"" the whole night. they were served vases (so 0,25l) the whole night. when time came to pay, i gave them their bill and it said 35 x vase pf heineken. then they tried to argue with me that the glass i served them, the 0,25l one, is not a vase but a flute, that a flute was 0,25 and not 0,18 and that a vase is 0,33l. i told them dudes i was not going to argue about something as ridiculous as this, as anyone who drinks beer in the netherlands knows what a flute and a vase is, and everyone know what size they are. but they refused to pay, so i told them to google it. they did. they found a website that listed the sizes and names of the glasses, but they wouldnt believe it because ""the website must be owned by heineken"" sure, a flute and vase conspiracy, that's a new one. they told me the bar next door serves a vase of 0,33l for the same price we serve a 0,25l one, so they weren't going to pay. i told them to cut their crap, that i work in that bar too (i do) and that the price of a 0,33 was higher than our 0,25 and that it's not called a vase. he didn't believe me and looked up their drinks menu (as if it would even matter what the prices next door were, even if they would be lower). he found out that, once again, i was right, but had some bullshit excuse as to why i was still wrong. in the end i told them to pay or i'd call the cops, so they paid but said they were going to write a complaint e-mail which i encouraged them to do. at this point even other costumers were telling them to stop being ridiculous cunts. i kindly asked them to never return again. they came back in a week later, but i told them they would not be served, they tried ordering drink from my co-worker but he told them to fuck off too so they just stood at the bar for a while and left. fecking idiots."	2727	44253	bkkoq2	emho5so

whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	im an ornithologist and have handled literally thousands of baby birds. someone in the neighborhood was asking on our neighborhood facebook group what to do if a baby fell out of its nest. i told her to put it back. a guy hops on (no idea who i was) and went off about how the mom would never return if you touch the baby and that she should just try to raise the baby (not easy if you dont know what you are doing and dont have the supplies). i informed him it was an old wives tale, of course the mom would come back. that fired him up and he went on about how i was an idiot and didnt know anything and i should just shut up. i informed him of my job and added a picture taken that day of me holding 4 nestlings. i added in an article about me for good measure. he decided to double down and continued to tell me i was clueless and he knew for a fact it was true and people should believe him because he was right and i should change professions because i clearly didnt know what i was talking about. ugh.	175	44253	bkkoq2	emi4rfl

""well, you have to make sure all those whales get to eat. when do you go feed them? it must be expensive to have enough food for them all."" this woman thought that every day, our boat captains would drive around the channel, tossing fish to dolphins and whales until they were all fed. i have no idea where she got this, considering she'd come over on that very boat. it took me a little while to politely convince her otherwise."	5555	44253	bkkoq2	emhm0ac

whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	i worked in orthopedics as a medical assistant for over 13 years. in the last practice i worked there was a surgeon who was always right and could never admit to being wrong about anything. he also always had to point out if someone else was wrong; you know the type. i had worked up a patient and took her history regarding her hip issues. if a patient had any prior x-rays or other images we would pull those images up on the computer. this lady had previously had a fluoroscopic hip injection so i pulled up the images from that procedure and documented it in the office note. after the doctor in question had seen the patient he was at the computer work station making more documentation into her record. i was standing there at the desk along with a couple of other medical assistants. the doctor says, oh by the way that lady has not had a fluoroscopic hip injection so i took that documentation out of her note. as i said earlier i had been working in ortho for 13 years and i knew a little bit about it. so me being the hard headed person i am began to argue with the doctor that yes indeed this woman had had that procedure. he argued right back. i said i pulled the images up in the exam room. he said sometimes you can confuse a hip injection with an si injection. no. no you cant. you can literally see the needle going into the hip joint. and.it was also labeled. so then he said ok lets go back and look at those images and ill show you. so we went back to the exam room and i pulled the images back up and he sat down at the computer to look at them. i stood there and watched him look at those pictures for at least a minute as he realized he was wrong and didnt want to admit it. he finally stood up and said you were right, ill add the documentation back to the note and he stormed out of the room without another word. i hated that asshole!	3402	44253	bkkoq2	emhogbh

"tl;dr: nascent coffee enthusiast guy tries to teach his barista roommate how to make coffee. not me but pretty close. i (male) live in an apartment with two other people one male, one female. the other guy tends to be act in lowkey sexist ways towards our female roommate, which is obvious to me because he will treat her differently even when we do the exact same things. anyway, this girl was a barista for three years. she knows how to make coffee. in the last month or so, the male roommate started getting really into coffee. he got a fancy grinder, fancy espresso machine, and started buying really good whole bean coffee. as his suitemates, he said we were welcome to use his equipment any time. one day, female roommate starts decides to make some coffee. male roommate immediately starts hovering, looking nervous, and trying to correct her when a) she had done nothing wrong b) he knows she was a barista, c) his coffeemaking experience was limited to the last few weeks at best, and d) she reminded him of these facts. he gets defensive, talking about how ""i dont want you to break it"" and ""its pretty complicated i dont know if you know what youre doing."" of course, he has never said any of this to me, despite the fact that i've never used anything more complicated than a french press. guess who i asked for help when i needed it?"	72	44253	bkkoq2	emi0jp9
whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	im a stage manager who looks a lot younger than i am and volunteers in youth theatre. i dont think many young actors know what i actually do as the big important star actors will often take charge and tell me things that i had decided for the show. eg. no bags in this area, no talking past this area, sign in at the desk.	69	44253	bkkoq2	emhoibc
whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	"i specialise in mental health, and a friend tried to argue that bulimia is ""the throwing up thing"". after explaining that bulimia consists of the binge purge cycle, and that even though vomiting is a common purge method it's not the only one, she still didn't quite get it. she seemed to think that because it was a common method of purge, it must be present to be diagnosed as bulimia. i've had to make clarifications to many people about many different mental health issues, but that one stuck out, i think because of how certain she was that she was right - wasn't the first time she'd refuse to believe she was anything other than right. edit: a lot of responses have asked about other methods of purging, some include: abusing laxatives and dieting aids, abnormal amounts of exercise, periods of starvation to counter the binge, and using syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. edit: i just wanted to clarify the differences between anorexia and bulimia. someone with bulimia will likely have a very normal diet, but when they experience a depressive or anxious episode, they'll go on an uncontrolled binge. in more severe cases this binge could be higher than 2000 calories, on top of their normal daily intake. following a binge, the individual will feel enormous amounts of regret, anger, and/or fear about the binge, and they'll begin trying to purge it from their body in whatever way they choose. with anorexia, the individual will likely have reduced their daily calory intake to below 1000 calories, they may engage in compulsively checking the calory content of their food, and perhaps weighing foods that otherwise don't need to be weighed out. additionally, an indiviual with anorexia may also purge as an aid to their weight lose intentions."	1378	44253	bkkoq2	emhgnkb

"i don't know if this really counts, but in 8th grade i had this taiwanese classmate suddenly speak to me in random mandarin. being korean american i had no clue what this guy was trying to say so i told him that i didn't understand anything he was saying. he started teasing me and calling me ""a disgrace"" for being a chinese person who didn't know any mandarin at which point i told him i was korean. for whatever reason this blew his mind and so for the next 10 minutes this *taiwanese guy* who only understood like 5 korean words due to kpop tried to quiz me, a bilingual *korean american*, on korean. i ended up speaking korean to him for the rest of the class and i finally convinced him that i was korean, not chinese. later i learned that he thought i was chinese because, get this, he overheard me on the phone calling my mom ""ma"". literally every language in the world refers to their mom in some variation of ""ma""."	59	44253	bkkoq2	emhsnbp

whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	i dont specialize in it, but i figured i would include it anyway since it pissed me off. ive been studying the korean language for years and years. last year, i moved to south korea to take a one-on-one accelerated course with a korean tutor. (i am hoping to someday adopt a korean child [not an infant] and move him/her to the u.s.; therefore, i want to make sure i can fully communicate.) because of this, i was pretty serious about paying the bigger bucks for a private tutor. with her, i studied for an average of 20 hours per week, plus an additional 10 or so on my own time. i dedicated a lot of time to my studies, in addition to practicing newly acquired skills with the locals. i would say i learned a lot. when i returned to the u.s., i discovered my co-worker (who is one of those know-it-all, entitled people) started talking to me about how shed taken up an interest in korean as well. mostly because of that one k-pop group. which is fine and all, cool. i really didnt care. but its when she started going off about how she learned how to read the alphabet but got confused with some of it that ticked me off. i literally took all of my lunch break to sit down and explain it to herbecause i knewbut she kept telling me it didnt seem right. no matter how much i told her, she said it was wrong. shes the type who always has to be right. even if shes wrong, shes right. even her opinions have to be superior. because i hate debating, i would usually just drop the subject. but this time i was so. enraged. which i never get. after a few minutes of listening to her thinking out-loud, i said: look, i went to this country, studied my ass off with a tutor, and youre telling me its not right? sure, go ahead and learn it wrong. if thinking youre right helps you sleep at night. . . we dont talk about it anymore.	485	44253	bkkoq2	emhknyg

whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	im a teacher. in any given class, i have limited english proficiency (lep) kids, i have 504 kids, and i have special ed kids in addition to regular ed kids. this means that when we take a test or quiz, there are several different versions. some are longer, some are shorter, some are simplified, all sorts of things. i had a parent call and accuse me of giving her kid the harder tests on purpose because i didnt like him. i had to pull in a principal who eventually got her to understand the situation. she wouldnt take my word for it. keep in mind that a students 504/special ed information is very private, so i cant just say, kids who get xyz test are special ed, and your kids not. she was miffed that her child had to share a classroom with different kids and im just like. ?	46	44253	bkkoq2	emhqvls
