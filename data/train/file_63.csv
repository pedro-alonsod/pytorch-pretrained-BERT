"i mean. porsche didn't change the name of its flagship car. edit: yes of course i know that porsche isn't an american brand. and i also know that they would never bother changing it because there is so much history behind that name. this comment was a joke to draw reference to a brand that actually does use the term ""911""."

108	64715	2371	bvgvkh	epp7z0q	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	my youth soccer team was called the bombers. i liked it because i'm a big yankee fan, and the yankees are sometimes referred to as the bronx bombers, so youngster /u/the_timminator liked to pretend that he was playing for the youth soccer version of the new york yankees. after 9/11 happened, the league deemed our team inappropriate, and made us change our name. our coach decided to change our name to the tigers. the tigers are a real baseball team. the tigers suck. i refused to play a game for the tigers, thus ending my short soccer career. i'd imagine if 9/11 happened on 7/11 instead, corporate would decide to change their name to the tigers too, and i would continue to not work there even harder than i do now.

114	64715	249	bvgvkh	epp7lhf	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	honestly i bet the attack wouldn't have been labelled as such.

119	64715	232	bvgvkh	eppd276	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	9/11 would not have been called 7/11 because there was already the store's name present in their mind when ever they hear the words 7/11. instead it would be called something along the lines of twin towers attack.
120	64715	65	bvgvkh	eppgv7q	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	probably nothing. a few reasons. * the name of the store is not 7/11, but 7-eleven. * the corporation is japanese owned, and japan has more stores than any other country (japan = 20,700 vs. us = 7,854). even though the date of 11 september 2001 is remembered as a dark day for most in the us, to the rest of the world it was just another day. * the japanese, as do most countries in the world, write their dates dd/mo, rather than mo/dd as in the us. in most of the world, 9/11 is seen as the 9th of november, rather than the 11th of september as in the us.
121	64715	55	bvgvkh	eppdiwk	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	i don't think 7/11 would have to do anything. i don't think people would have called the terror attack 7/11 to begin with since the brand already existed and people would know it's confusing to call the attack the same thing as a major brand. people would pick a different name for the attack.

124	64715	37	bvgvkh	eppehs7	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	"it wouldn't be called ""7/11"", it'd be called ""the july tragedy"" or something."
125	64715	214	bvgvkh	eppcwat	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	pushed for america to use dd/mm like the rest of the world, lol.
126	64715	35	bvgvkh	eppb42x	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	people wouldn't name the attack after the date it happened. they would just say twin towers or something like that.
127	64715	96	bvgvkh	epp7a3v	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	"rebrand themselves as 7-1-1 as in ""seven one one"". the phone number 9-1-1 has the same numbers yet 9/11 is not invoked when mentioning it."
128	64715	31	bvgvkh	eppc2ua	if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	this feels like it would make for a better showerthought than an askreddit.
