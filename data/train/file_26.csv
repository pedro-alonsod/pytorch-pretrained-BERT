"i used to tell my kids not to take off their shoes and socks in the car, especially on short trips. just leave them on so that we don't have to spend 5 minutes finding and putting them back on before we run into the store. imagine a single dad with two young kids running around the car trying to re-shoe my children in the grocery store parking lot in the middle of an arizona summer, yuck. one day we went to the store and my daughter was missing her shoe. it was nowhere to be found. ""daddy, i didn't want you to be mad that my shoe was off so i threw it out the window."" made sense to a 5-year old i guess."

5421	32219	1557	bkjqjj	emh75wv	parents on reddit, what was your  i raised an idiot moment?	not a parent, however i feel like this belongs here. when i was about 3-4 years old i stuck a pinto bean up my nose while at preschool. there was a [sand box](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/sand-and-water-table/s278226?localedetail=us&a=1552&campaignid=1712429706&adgroupid=67277874376&targetid=pla-528299727589&pla_sku=278226&pcat=hsw&ag=kids&scid=scplp278226&sc_intid=278226&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=cjwkcajw8ltmbrbceiwabhh-6jngikhqktvkxzvw_piojefyqpfzniw0lsjdv2qohpqkj93ukdxttbocbjsqavd_bwe) that instead of being filled with sand was filled with pinto beans (im guessing they did this because beans make less of a mess) that was filled with toys for kids to play with. while playing at the table, i thought it would be fun to stick a bean up my nose, so i did exactly that. if i remember correctly, i was able to stick it up my nose and take it out successfully the first few times that i did it, but then it got stuck. so me being the smart little kid that i was, i decided not to tell anyone about. me not telling anyone was due to a mix of me being worried about what my parents would say, and not knowing how id convey to them that i had stuck a bean up my nose and couldnt get it out. eventually, a whole 7 hours later while i was taking a bath i decided it would be the right time to tell my parents what happened. i dont remember much after me telling my parents what happened, but from what theyve told me they were both highly amused and incredibly concerned as to how they ended up trying to get pinto bean out of their soaking wet childs nose. sadly, they couldnt get it out and so off to the er we went.

"not a parent, but i have a story from when i was little. my grandparents lived in our home with us for many years. i used to be with them all the time, they picked me up from school etc. i was probably 5-6 years at this time. my grandmother said to me one time ""never walk down the stairs with your hands in your pockets"". at first i obeyed. but this one time when i was running around our house and playing i proceeded to our stone-stairs. they are outside and lead down to the yard and my grandparents front door. they are pretty ""rough"". i thought to myself that i'm not stupid or incapable of walking down some stairs. and i put my hands in my pocket, just to prove to myself (and later tell my grandmother) that i can walk down the stairs with my hands in my pockets. of course i tripped almost immediately and half of my head was completely scratched up from the rough stairs. i never walked down the stairs with my hands in my pockets again :)"
