8211	18364	462	boi2wy	enh5g2n	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	whenever people like jack bauer just call for some 3d building plans to be sent to his cell phone. typically, architecture/engineering firms don't send out their cad files to anyone. and if they did send those files out, there's no reason for some government agency to have them unless the building was owned by that agency. and they probably wouldn't be 3d (though that is becoming more popular). in reality, jack's friends would call up the building owner, who would put them in touch with the building engineer. then the building engineer would act like he's too busy to help with anything. at some point you *may* get some drawings from him. they will be scanned pdfs. a lot of them will be illegible. they will also most likely be out of date. then when mr. bauer is crawling up around in the ductwork, he'd probably find himself face to face with security bars that are in place to keep people from crawling in the ductwork. and that's if the ductwork is even big enough to have a full grown man in them, let alone able to support the weight. &#x200b; also, government labs. they aren't high tech, black-walled, futuristic super lab. they are nondescript brick buildings with no windows and furniture from 1985.

8216	18364	3529	boi2wy	engj45s	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	that strangling people kills them in a few seconds. a guy can strangle someone to death in 15 seconds and move on. in reality, it can take full minutes of strangling someone to kill them. they never get tired from all that effort. when the btk killer started out, he tried to strangle a family to death one by one. but instead of killing them, he was just knocking them out so once he moved on to the 3rd person, the 1st was waking up again. movies just make those scenes last a few seconds because it would be a boring scene to watch.

8244	18364	839	boi2wy	engqy0p	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	"how easy it apparently is to snap a person's neck. if our necks were that easy to snap, rollercoasters would be death machines. we aren't birds, our spines' only job is to stay intact so our brain still works. if they're that bad at it we would never have made it this far. also, hitting a person on the back, top, or front of the head with the back of a gun does not easily knock a person out. it causes at least a concussion if not permanent serious brain damage. there are a few select places on the head that won't cause serious damage, and the top of the head is not one of them. in the movies and tv shows, someone sneaks up behind someone and just ""bam"" on the back of the head. that has never, ever worked. and third, getting shot in the shoulder isn't something you just shrug off. you likely won't be able to use your arm for at least a week probably more. in action movies the star will get shot in the arm, then pull someone up with that same arm. the shock alone of getting shot often causes people to wet themselves, not kill the bad guy and save a million people. edit: of course there are exceptions to all of these,my quibble is the fact that in almost every single tv show and movie they get it wrong. the majority of the time for most of these you would die, but there are exceptions. edit 2: cleared up some confusion on my part about the knocking a person out."

8253	18364	347	boi2wy	engurzq	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	i cant watch romcoms any more because they all follow the same formula to a point where the anticipation/anxiety makes me physically ill. 1) main character has problem. problem is not inherently large and would be easily understood if discussed early on in any relationship. 2) mc meets/actively pursues significant other, does not discuss problem. 3) still does not discuss problem. 4) problem resurfaces in a way that mc does not anticipate. so reverts back to pubescence in ability to emotionally handle problem and most likely leaves without any discussion. 5) mc delivers powerful speech about being sorry and how they should be together, so most likely forgives mc.

8272	18364	51	boi2wy	engw3yo	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	scenes depicting violence/fights tend to annoy me. i know people usually point out things like shooting guns indoors and such, but one i find gets rarely mentioned is melee fighting. these are usually just as bad, for different reasons. one of the most glaring issues is how often armor and weapon-type advantages are completely ignored. spears are an obvious example. [range? what range?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdnn5tzu6r8&t=1m49s) [this spear is actually a pointy staff.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm9wwthozcm&t=1m23s) [i have a spear, but i'm going to charge in and kick you instead.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj9uqdkpnqe&t=40s) for reference, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8rwlxlztim) is realistic spear vs sword fighting. you can see the clear advantage the spear grants over the sword.
8273	18364	55	boi2wy	enhfy4k	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	i don't know if porn counts as movies but i once saw a scene where this girl was cooking skittles. like candy on a pan over a stove top. it was funny at first until i realized that i've never seen a porn scene where actual decent cooking was happening. i don't know if it's an industry inside joke or reducing possible burn risk since there are naked people on set.
8274	18364	1103	boi2wy	engmmhm	what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	horror: the person that get rid of the bad guy, always have a haunted, wise, cold personality flip at the end. action: always one specific/special person or group with unique abillities, capabilities or personality, always win. when do the good guys lose everything? sci-fi: humans inferior, aliens superior in any way. humans kick alien ass. humans are always the victims. how about a movie where humans either lost or the humans are the invaders? edit: holy shit! did not expect this to blow up that much! thanks for all the points! :)
