5289	32667	2707	brlti4	eof1g0i	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	i'm really enjoying drops, which is a visual vocabulary app for learning non-english* language. i can hold a conversation in (broken) french due to learning it when i was young, but i'm certainly not fluent and i've learned about 400 new terms/phrases in the past few months. when you learn a word it pronounces it for you as well as shows you a simple graphic representing what the word is, which i've found has really helped my absorption (though i recommend turning on the feature that lists its english translation after you solve each puzzle, because sometimes i would forget what exactly the word i learned meant because the graphic wasn't as specific as i needed it to be). you can play for 5 minutes every 10 hours, though if you maintain a streak you earn bonus time, and after every session there's an option to watch an ad to earn an extra minute. you can pay to get unlimited access but i actually really like having short sessions twice a day, because i'm definitely the type to want to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, and then burn out on it because i didn't pace myself. *edit: actually you can learn english, too!

5307	32667	92	brlti4	eofsp21	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	a few apps that are helpful for anyone, but are very useful for dealing with the daily struggles of my mental health problems: **[daylio](https://daylio.webflow.io/)** (android & ios) - quick daily mood journal. you select how your mood was that day, and then you can check off items/activities that you did (you can include customized ones). gives nice statistics, takes less than a minute to fill out, and lets me analyze patterns in my mood - was my mood better or worse on days i was drinking? days i saw my friends? days i took a nap? etc. **[habit tracker/habitbull](http://www.habitbull.com/)** (android & ios) - a habit tracker/reminder app that isn't gamified like habitica. reminders for daily tasks, weekly, or even customizable for something you do every other tuesday at 9am. gives nice statistics on streaks and % of days you successfully complete the tasks. mostly helps because i need something to nag me into brushing my teeth every night and scooping the litter box more regularly. **[sleep as android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/)** (android only) - very useful alarm. i use mine to let me snooze only once for 10 minutes and then must scan a barcode taped to my fridge in order to shut the alarm off. forces me up and out of bed, and encourages me to take my vitamins & medication, and start breakfast instead of falling back to sleep. customizable tasks for shutting off the alarm if you don't want to scan a barcode - that one just works for me. **app i just enjoy:** **[old school runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/mobile)** (android & ios) - because i'm a nerd that loves runescape, and now i can play it on my phone or tablet :)
5308	32667	4615	brlti4	eofbvph	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	myfitnesspal. the annoying truth is the best way to lose weight is count your calories and treat it like a budget each day. myfitness pal makes it easy to log whatever you eat, and it has almost every kind of food you can imagine, fast foods, everything in the grocery store, even really random stuff comes up to my surprise (like ramen package from japan). you an even scan the bar code of a package to add it. it only takes a few minutes a day to enter stuff and it helps you figure out what to eat to stay at a calorie deficit.

5318	32667	2742	brlti4	eof27kk	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	google maps. i am talking specifically about the option to download offline maps for almost any city in the world. they really help when you are in a foreign city and you try to find some place, as offline maps will show you where you are at currently and where the location is you are looking for, without the need to use data. edit for clarification: google maps is not an underrated app, that is true. i do believe though that the offline map feature of google maps is an underrated and useful part of that app.

5336	32667	920	brlti4	eofaj9s	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"if you have an iphone, there's an app on it called ""measure"", which uses your camera and you can select two points and measure the distance between the two, pretty nifty. &#x200b; edit: since people are asking, it is very particular, like if you try to measure something from a distance, it most likely won't be extremely accurate. to get an accurate measurement, i've found you have to drag your phone along the length of what you're trying to measure rather than simply pointing your camera from point a to point b. so it has its limitations but if you do the first method i find it works rather well, but yeah disclaimer."

5373	32667	16	brlti4	eohr7ye	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"annoyed phone guy here. seeing some bad advice. not sure if ignorance or malice. i'm not gonna call anyone out, though. first big problem i see. subscription apps. this is a big problem on ios, but it's coming to android, too. so what happens is, you have an app that should be free or a one-time payment, but it's a monthly subscription. as in, you will pay that amount every single month as long as you have the app. a lot of weather apps are doing it, even ones that charge you up front. they get the data from public sources, too. these predatory apps are a dime a dozen and they really only exist to rip off stupid people. obviously some subscriptions are justified, like netflix, hulu, spotify, things that are providing constantly updated content. but a weather app, or a shopping list. you don't need to keep paying for that. free is good, paid is fine, subscription is a scam. i have an iphone, and i'll post the best underrated apps i have that i use. with both android and ios, there are usually a bunch of apps competing for the same spot on your phone. the difference between a phone guy and a casual user is one who looked at all the options and found the best (not always the same answer, since we're all different) and the other who just got the first thing they found and made it work, for better or worse. most of these are free, and most are on both major mobile platforms. i'll let you know if they're not. ourgroceries: shopping list. been using it for almost 10 years now. it's on ios, it's on android, and it's on the web. totally free to use, but it has a banner ad. $5 to get rid of it. worth paying on android. if you have an iphone, you should know the developer doesn't care about apple at all. we don't get any of the good features. it's pretty bare-bones. still worth paying if you want that extra quarter inch, but absolutely not necessary. ishows tv: tracks tv shows through trakt.tv. this is ios only. trakt.tv is a website you can use on your desktop (or mobile) browser. on android, seriesguide is the way to go, and it's free. ishows costs $2 or $3. basically, you add the shows you watch, and as you watch them, you mark them as seen and you can rate them out of 10 (five stars but you can do half stars). if the show is ongoing, it will show how many days until the next episode, but if you're behind, it'll show how many aired episodes you haven't seen yet. for anyone who watches a lot of shows, this is good stuff. bing: laugh it up. it's not google. on mobile, it's better. i've checked it out on android, too, and it's just as legit there. microsoft threw everything but the kitchen sink at their app. private searching is front and center if you want to be anonymous. it has maps, weather, news, all kinds of stuff. and the best part of all? while the google app will quite literally tunnel around your ad blocker, if you have one, to get ads onto your phone, bing. includes. an ad. blocker. yes, it has adblock plus built right in. abp is the controversial one with ""acceptable ads"" which means ad providers can pay to bypass it, but this feature can be disabled to make abp a decent ad blocker. look, if you need help with games, ever, you know wikia is a festering shithole of ads. bing your game stuff, you'll see the difference it makes. abp has to be turned on first, though, as it's off by default, though once it sees so many ads, it will tell you about it. google keep: a few people mentioned this already, but it's worth repeating. best notes app ever. once you do categories and sharing, it gets so much better. apollo: best reddit client on ios, and it's not even close. when i used android, i used sync and baconreader. bacon's on ios, too, but it's a different app made by a different team at the same company. there are a ton of reddit clients for both platforms, and most of them are made by redditors who want to make reddit better, so. most of them are somebody's favorite. i just try different reddit clients and find things that they don't do that apollo does. apollo matches my flow. maybe you use reddit differently. in any case, it's worth trying different ones, and it's worth paying for a few different ones. i prefer apollo, but i want to see others thrive, too, because that encourages everyone to do their best. google photos: i saw this mentioned once as ""free backup."" it's more than that. all photos 16mp or less will be backed up for free. above 16mp, you get to make a choice. downsample to 16mp or use your google drive storage (15gb free, with paid plans for more). no iphone has had more than 12mp to date. some android phones have gone over 16, though. my wife's last phone was 20 or 24, i forget which. 16mp is fine, though, and if your camera is less. i always hear about people who lost precious photos. this doesn't have to be a problem. and it's a solution that is free to solve. and there's much more to google photos. scanner mini: someone mentioned camscanner, which has issues, and they were brought to the poster's attention, i suppose, given their edit. the truth is, you shouldn't pay for scanning. google, microsoft, and apple all do it for free. google's is photo scanner. microsoft's is office lens. and apple's is built into notes. i use readdle's scanner mini. it works with documents, their file manager. there is a pro version but i don't need it. documents: almost forgot this because it's on my dock and i'm going by homepage. documents is an ios file manager and cloud manager that plays media and reads documents. it also lets me turn my phone into a wifi drive and share everything with anyone on the same wifi network. i have yet to meet a good android file manager that does that. let me be clear, if we're on the same network, i can take your android phone, open chrome, browse to an address (docsfiletransfer dot com), this will give you a barcode, my iphone scans it, and now your android phone is browsing my iphone, and you can download any file i have on it. if you have an iphone, it's easier, my documents will detect your documents and they auto pair and i can send the file right on over. for android, solid is the file manager of choice. but it doesn't do the wifi drive. there are apps out there that do, but since i don't use android as my personal phone, i haven't really looked into it. movies anywhere: more of a service, but it's also an app. it's disney's movie streaming service, but it has a poorly kept secret. if you connect another streaming service to it, like itunes, it will give you free itunes copies of everything in ma and free ma copies of everything in itunes. well, limited to certain studios, and movies only, not tv, music, books, anime, any of that stuff. there are like 7 services it supports, and if you connect more than a couple, they even give you free movies, and they go to all services. i'll tell you two reasons why this is awesome. one, if one service goes under, your movies still exist on all the rest. two, itunes has good sales and whatever, but you can only really watch its movies on apple devices. if you switched from iphone to android, apple sort of holds those movies hostage. connect ma and google, and now you can watch itunes movies on youtube. yeah. that's huge. youtube is on everything. so is vudu, but youtube is probably something you use more. waze: social maps. shows things like speed traps, and debris on the road. contingent upon people actually reporting these things, and you can report them yourself. pretty nice map app, too, though google maps reigns supreme here. (google owns waze.) chrome remote desktop/anydesk: you know what's cool? running windows on your phone. you can't actually run windows 10 on an iphone, or an android phone for that matter, but if you have chrome remote desktop on your computer, you can access it right from your phone, whether you're in the same room or on the other side of the planet. the possibilities are endless. anydesk has more options, but isn't quite as smooth. but anydesk lets you control an android phone from the computer or an iphone, as long as the app is running (but not the other way around, ios is the only platform that cannot host). so yeah, android on an iphone. this isn't for practical use, it's for helping someone. so if you were having problems with your android phone, you could give me your desk number, and i could take over your phone, over the internet, from my iphone, and use it like i was holding it. there is some input lag, and if you didn't like what i was doing, you could kick me off. good for people with older parents. chrome remote desktop can only host on pc. i prefer crd for taking control of my pc with my phone, but anydesk has uses as well. google opinion rewards: mentioned before, but they didn't mention it's for ios, too. and the ios version pays out, every $2 earned, to paypal. that's because paypal can be used for app store/itunes purchases, but, unlike android users, ios users can cash out their opinion rewards money. also, being an iphone user means your opinion is worth more. that's not my opinion. that's google, giving me fewer surveys than my wife when we both had android (women get more surveys) and now me getting more surveys with an iphone. if *she* got an iphone, her surveys would go way up. opener: this is ios only, because it addresses a problem that android never had. so on android, if you have two or more of the same app, android will ask you which app you want to use. makes sense, right? apparently, apple never figured out how to do that. and it's a damn shame. some apps can choose the app they want to call, but there's no system-wide setting. so something that would open in the app you don't want it to, share it to opener, and opener will do what android does, offer you the choice and let you set it. android expats using ios will enjoy this greatly. edit: broke reddit's limit! one more in the replies."
