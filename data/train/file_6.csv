2906	42575	3796	bvkru1	epq6h14	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i honestly miss video stores. it was fun to wander around them and you might end up renting something you never heard of on a whim.
2907	42575	5693	bvkru1	epq6kls	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	electronic stores where you get stuff for projects i wish i could have gone there
2908	42575	7153	bvkru1	epqgd8d	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	flea markets. yes, i know they still exist. the problem is that thanks to the proliferation of the internet, it's pretty difficult to find a good deal on much of anything, especially games. people check the prices on ebay and other places and just price around that. you could go to a dozen flea markets or pop up shops and the same game will be around the same price at every single one of them.
2909	42575	3814	bvkru1	epq48zq	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	kb toys and toys r us. i grew up with weekend trips to kb. and to this day, as a man, i still *love* toys. it's something i passed on to my own son, and though he's too young to have known kb, i loved taking him to tru, even if just to look around. it was one of our things - our father and son activity. and now, there's nothing that even compares.
2910	42575	4232	bvkru1	epq3etg	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss the former quality of lands' end merchandise. lands' end has really gone downhill since having to compete online - to the point where most of their merchandise is unrecognizable from its former quality and durability.
2911	42575	17336	bvkru1	epqi6xa	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	sales pros in general. a guy selling you a fridge who has sold fridges for 10 years and knows all about them. now i look for stars and try to discern real vs paid vs bot reviews.
2912	42575	1009	bvkru1	epqa3ls	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss magazine stores / newsstands. part of my routine for years on fridays was a walk into the neighborhood newsstand on the way to work. i'd spend 15 minutes perusing the new stuff. i'd usually spend 20-30 bucks on 5-6 magazines. video game stuff, fortean times, games magazine, always that day's sf chronicle, whatever. most of those places are long gone. i suppose i spend less money on that stuff, but i miss it.
2913	42575	18718	bvkru1	epqcoku	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss really good hobby shops. i build plastic models usually world war ii aircraft. those high-end hobby shops have all the closed down, now all you can generally find are rc shops that have a shelf of a couple plastic models here and there, the only exception in the greater portland area is tammie's hobbies but i'm pretty sure their days are numbered for plastic models as well.
2914	42575	9026	bvkru1	epq3t7x	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	chain record stores, like record bar or tower records. wolf camera, where i spent many happy hours indulging my photo hobby in the 1990s.
2915	42575	30549	bvkru1	epq7g4h	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	arcades for sure. my dad used to drop me off at a nickel arcade with 5 bucks. i felt like a king.
2916	42575	4670	bvkru1	epq5p7y	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	hastings. hastings was probably similar to a blockbuster, but hastings had movies and tv shows to rent, books, music, other stuff that i cant remember that you could buy. it was just so good but now their is a tj maxx in its place. it will truly be missed in my heart. edit: i just wanted to say that when hastings went out i had my parents buy me too many coloring books (they were a dollar a book in my defensive) but im still sad that i didnt get all the greys anatomy seasons or the halloweentown movies. edit 2: im kinda new to reddit, but what does a gold medal mean, also thank you to whoever gave it to me?
2917	42575	7875	bvkru1	eppzdme	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	most of the shops in my small country town close because everyone orders everything off of amazon, and now there's many abandoned buildings
2918	42575	11241	bvkru1	epq6b0g	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	used book stores. theres now only one in a 5 city radius that is only open tuesdays and thursdays from 1pm to 4pm. i use thriftbooks now, it's cheap and they have a lot of different books, but it's not the same as browsing through stacks looking for treasures. edit: i've been informed that for the most part used bookstores are booming, i guess the suburbs outside detroit are just cesspools. sounds about right.
2919	42575	18806	bvkru1	epq0i7m	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	the old blockbuster in my town had a game console that somehow always had new and interesting games to show.
2920	42575	13989	bvkru1	epq3a8p	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"i really miss radio shack. i used to always go in there with friends and look at all the remote control helicopters and the crazy tivo devices and everything that i thought was so awesome. its so weird how those things were so revolutionary and now its just like ""oh yeah you can get that at walmart for $5."" edit: the consensus is everyone hates best buy"
2921	42575	8953	bvkru1	epq1r7x	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	borders
2922	42575	23459	bvkru1	eppzkxc	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	12 year old me misses toys r us. my son will more than likley never experience the joy of being let loose in a giant toy store.
2923	42575	435	bvkru1	epq69ic	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	radioshack. i miss looking through the endless drawers of capacitors, transformers, ect. and trying to think up dumb projects and things to make. there are still some radioshacks around, but they're not the same. they're just gutted phone stores.
2924	42575	1046	bvkru1	epq5py1	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss waldenbooks/borders and b. dalton. i go to the mall a great deal less than i used to because book stores we a primary attraction for me.
2925	42575	190	bvkru1	epqgkxd	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	funcoland. pre-gamestop era game chain that really revolutionized the used gaming market. i miss going in and picking up their [monthly printed price list](http://i.imgur.com/matgpli.jpg). you could try anything before you bought it, test it to make sure it worked, etc. if youre lucky your town has an indie game store that somewhat replicates this experience, but gamestop ruined a great thing.
2926	42575	837	bvkru1	epqre2j	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"the crappy little corner arcade. not a fancy beercade or a dave & busters, i'm talking an actual old-guy-with-a-half-smoked-cigar dingy-as-hell corner shop, grimy exterior, no maintenance or effort put in, dim lighting, and a whole bunch of aged arcade machines - never the newest release, always minimum a year old. the city's finest snack bar, offering little debbie snack cakes for 25 cents marked ""not for individual resale!"" and cans of store-brand soda sold warm out of the 12-pack. luxurious duck-tape covered barstools - but he splurged on black duck tape! no silver here, whoa-ho! no bill changer, just a disgusting bucket full of quarters that the machines get emptied into, into which he shoves his fist and grabs $5 worth to break the next customer's bill, some petri dish equivalent of the food chain and the circle of life in twenty-five cent form. that arcade. the real american arcade. not this ""fun center"" crap with tickets and prizes -- nope. just top five scores with names like ""ass"" ""fu"" ""dam"" ""poo"" and, of course, ""ass"" one more time."
2927	42575	266	bvkru1	epq5mg6	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	borders because they sent me 40% off coupons.
2928	42575	2235	bvkru1	epq20qx	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"the sears catalog. i used to love going through that as a kid around christmas and seeing what i wanted to ask santa for. what's stupid is sears could have been bigger than amazon since they already had a head start on the ""order from home"" business, but they just didn't embrace the internet and now sears is dying."
2929	42575	354	bvkru1	epq8dc5	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	all the small bookstores have disappeared in my city. even the second-hand bookstores which were my favourites. oxford bookstores are surviving somehow and everything else is a text book store. i understand ordering online is way more convenient (i do it as well) but i do miss the feel of being surrounded by books and thumbing through the pages and looking for one that might catch my eye.
2930	42575	539	bvkru1	epq4qfo	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	dz discovery zone edit - spelling (genuinely what i thought it was as a kid) also editing to add clarification - it connects with places ruined by the internet because the deeper we got into computer games/internet activity/raised compliance, the lower success places like this have. plus someone just stated dz discovery zone was purchased by blockbuster which went bankrupt because of the internet.
2931	42575	10436	bvkru1	epqgftc	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"did any of you guys have that discovery nature store at your malls? it would have those native american rain tubes, that when placed on its top or bottom had the beads inside sound like it was raining. that and had a bunch of cool ""seen on tv"" toys and books. it was great, then one day it was just gone. wish it was still around today, so that it would still be cool to learn. edit: holy fucking shit, first gold and silver, thank you kind strangers! edit edit: holy dooly in the pooly, what the fuck is this, platinum?! i didn't even know there was one, omg how can i ever thank you cool dudes for this??"
2932	42575	127	bvkru1	epqme8q	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i was a little sad to see my local k-mart go. i went there around thanksgiving last year, just after they set up their christmas section. i don't know whether the plan was drawn up in some regional or national headquarters, or if it was a local effort. but somebody, somewhere, had put a lot of effort into making the christmas section at my local k-mart something pretty special. it was nice looking, lots of trees everywhere, toys, decorations on display, the works. and all i could think was that those had been set up just in time for the store to close down. made me sad a little.
2933	42575	180	bvkru1	epqjyf3	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	magazines in general seem to be part of a bygone era. if you had a specialist interest or hobby a magazine subscription was the best way to keep in the loop and have a monthly dose of excitement. now internet communities are much more plentiful and specified but there's no longer the depth of information as when it was compiled by experts and promoted with beautiful pictures and layouts.
2934	42575	734	bvkru1	epq66y2	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss the big, fat newspapers on sundays with all the ads for local sales. edit: it's not just that i miss the ritual of reading the sunday paper for all of its contents, good and bad. it's also that i miss how it was special. i grew up in the 1970s and 80s. back then there was just less stuff everywhere . i remember the excitement of visiting a city where you could find unique style and products. now, both online and in corporate stores everywhere you can get practically anything and everything in a matter of a quick trip or a click of a mouse.
2935	42575	50	bvkru1	epq8cgy	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	toys r us. im gonna throw out that i always wanted to do the nickelodeon super toy run when i was a kid.
2936	42575	373	bvkru1	epq14ia	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	steve & barry's
2937	42575	98	bvkru1	epql9fh	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	woolworths. edit: to clarify, i'm from the uk.
2938	42575	2438	bvkru1	epq58ou	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	malls. i miss the glory days of malls. being able to go hang out, grab some food, etc. its just not the same anymore.
2939	42575	793	bvkru1	epq0rzw	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	arcades
2940	42575	1093	bvkru1	eppzg3e	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	blockbuster. wasnt alive long to see it frequently but i was inside one and it was cool to see all those movie.
2941	42575	835	bvkru1	epq357q	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	gamestop i know that theyre still around but since theyve changed the way they do business and because they had to adapt to the internet, you dont get the same experience you did versus 10-15 years ago. whens the last time youve been to a brick and mortar store for a midnight release of a game?
2942	42575	191	bvkru1	epq6r0h	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	compusa
2943	42575	43	bvkru1	epqgn5k	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	there was a used bookstore in almost every strip mall where i lived. i miss the abundance of used bookstores. and the beautiful, stale scent of all those old books.
2944	42575	41	bvkru1	epqhkji	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i just miss being able to go into a store and talk to someone who knew anything about what was in the store.
2945	42575	41	bvkru1	epqji0x	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	maybe not killed by the internet as much as home consoles, but 42 year old me really misses arcades at every mall. the arcade was such a magical place to spend a few hours.
2946	42575	45	bvkru1	epqnvu0	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	second run movie theaters. digital killed them off. and also junkyard and pawn shops. theyre still around but not the same. they all price everything by national sales info. yes, someone in topeka may have paid $75 for an oem steel rim for a minivan, but they've got a hundred on the lot that are going to get crushed eventually.
2947	42575	43	bvkru1	epqonn2	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	the print edition of the onion.
2948	42575	43	bvkru1	epqp2a4	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"mediaplay. they were a ""hip and edgy"" multimedia big box where i spent countless hours listening to cds on the sample headsets. my parents used to take my brother and i for midnight book (harry potter and the sorcerer's stone) and movie (o brother, where art thou) releases. they showed kids movies on repeat in a tiny theater in a model steam train, huge fluffy chairs in the book section, every popular console with new releases, a sprawling movie and music selection, and pop culture apparel by the truck load. there was a tjmaxx next door, and rather than taking us there, my mom would leave my brother and i for hours. we'd tell her to meet us by the magazines in the back of the store, knowing full well she would have to pass the new release book rack guaranteeing us an extra half hour. when they closed, everything was liquidated. i got wire shelves for my room and my brother ended up buying a display mannequin for $5. as a huge beavis and butthead fan, he proudly displayed his do america shirt through college."
2949	42575	457	bvkru1	epq312v	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	circuit city was always the best electronics store
2950	42575	350	bvkru1	epq8i0g	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	most stores you think were killed by the internet were actually killed by walmart. ultra cheap prices were what killed mom and pop stores. the ones the internet really killed were the book and electronics stores.
2951	42575	84	bvkru1	epq63do	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	radioshack, toys r us, blockbuster, and sears are the main ones for me. i can't decide on which i miss the most and want back the most.
2952	42575	170	bvkru1	epqfqsd	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	blockbuster. going to blockbuster every weekend to pick out movies was so much fun. sometimes i could even pick out some games. then wed go home and make popcorn and watch the movies wed pick out. if i was lucky, my parents would let me watch the r-rated ones with them. video rentals used to be an institution. i agree with some commentators that the internet has hurt family togetherness.
2953	42575	37	bvkru1	epqph0u	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	my local record store 
2954	42575	34	bvkru1	epqlkzo	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	kb toys. i wish i could take my nieces and nephews to a real toy store. also malls that don't look like a zombie flick. i remember every christmas, my parents would give us each a $100 with a meet up place and time, then set us loose.
2955	42575	34	bvkru1	epqngf3	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	suncoast
2956	42575	81	bvkru1	eppzfsx	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	brookstone
2957	42575	28	bvkru1	epqg0iw	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	going to blockbuster or movie king or whatever your local chain was on a friday evening to pick out a new release, maybe rent a game. you and your buddy can decide which one, oh and theres a pizza shop next door so guess what moms buying for dinner tonite? going to rent a movie was an experience.
2958	42575	26	bvkru1	epqihx3	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	sam goodys. it was essentially the internet before i had it. tons of music, anime and games i never hesrd of. used to spend all day in there browsing games, movies, cds, magazines. they had everything. i was so upset when they had their going out of business sale that i didn't even buy anything. that store turned into a gamestop and i think the entire company turned into fye. there weren't any fye near me though so i had lost my reach to the outside world.
2959	42575	22	bvkru1	epqcmxu	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	eb games
2960	42575	69	bvkru1	epq8urf	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	not killed but ruined gamestop. it used to be a treat just to walk through a video game store and look at the new releases but now it's just a bunch of random semi video game stuff with the games on a backwall. i partially believe it's due to consoles allowing you to buy digital games.
2961	42575	23	bvkru1	epqh8bf	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	definitely miss blockbuster. friday's as a little kid our dad would take us all to blockbuster to rent some movies for the weekend and we'd order pizza. those were the happiest days of my life.
2962	42575	64	bvkru1	epq5ut5	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	hastings. you could pretty much get anything there. skateboards, tv's, books, video games, movies, comic books. all sorts of fun things.
2963	42575	224	bvkru1	epq3hpm	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	there's just something about porno mags. i dunno, just flipping the pages to see big busty betty's bottom is not the same as just typing big busty betty's bottom in a search bar and seeing all the results on your monitor. it's more convenient and better content wise but the thrill is just not the same.
2964	42575	305	bvkru1	epq35it	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	mix tapes and mix cds. they have been pretty much replaced by playlists on spotofy on other sites, but i miss them. it was an art form trying to create the perfect mix that would fit the time limit allowed and had each song flow nicely into the other.
2965	42575	61	bvkru1	epq7pc2	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	my business in club penguin
2966	42575	60	bvkru1	epqlziv	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	gonna get buried but i'm saying this because i need to. special sauce skate shop in bay shore, ny. i literally grew up in that shop and it was my pre-internet source for all things in the skateboarding scene. back in those days it was your local shop, ccs, and thrasher magazine. simple times. the dudes who ran it were super chill dealing with me and my friend's dumb asses when we were kids(i run into one of them at the bars sometimes, still chill af.) they helped me learn to grip tape my first deck. my favorite board ever was a shiloh greathouse from world industries with venture trucks, spitfire 50 mm wheels, and shorty's bearings. got it from sauce for xmas(thanks mom and dad.) i landed my first tre flip on that bad boy. they had a table top chess set and chairs in the front window and sometimes there'd be dudes just playing chess which was cool af. i'm not sure if the internet is what did them in but i suspect it played a part. i miss you ss. edit: spelling is stoopid
2967	42575	19	bvkru1	epqmjq5	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i'm old, okay? pinball arcades. there used to be one in almost every mall, and usually a couple of stand-alone arcades in every town. a pocket full of quarters, and you could have hours of fun. it was the place for teens to hang out.

2969	42575	18	bvkru1	eprjjz6	what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	hardware stores. real hardware stores, guy working there knew a little about everything. plumbing, electrical, gardening, tools, screws, nut and bolts, fix a screen or storm window, paint, plaster, cement, they had it and knew all about it. it was great.
