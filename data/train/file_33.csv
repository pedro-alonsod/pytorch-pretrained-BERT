680	52694	4175	buluna	epfevcc	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i was a model for a few big name/well known make up companies. i did several print ads for magazines and a few television commercials. the makeup artists do use the product advertised, but minimally. like that mascara they're touting? it's over really good fake eye lashes and they also used another brand of mascara along with the one they're trying to sell you. also - the clothes in the ads you see are pinned to high heaven on the model. they fit nothing like they look. it's not you. it's not your body. it's fake advertising. most of us models look just like you wearing that crap without all the pins and tucks and double sided tape.
681	52694	3233	buluna	epf2h7z	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	a friend of mine got a job at a prominent local distillery that makes an extremely popular flavored whisky. they literally buy whisky from a 3rd party distillery and dump torani flavoring syrup into it.

"one of my friends' brothers was on the mtv show room raiders. everything in the show is staged. all of the items that they would find were planted. at the end of the show, the prize was not a date with the girl that he ""picked"", he just got her phone number."
683	52694	865	buluna	epfcoa5	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	did some work on the trading floor at goldman sachs, i had access to all trading accounts and transactions. came across some shady looking accounts which did not meet policy (it did not use clearly identifiable name and i could not find records of creation or testing for it etc.) i asked my supervisor if i should look into this, he turned to me and said we dont ask about those accounts, just ignore them. orders from the top trading account creation is a long and detailed process that requires formal approval from multiple lines of management, these accounts circumvented all that and were basically anonymous with no trace, they were also trading high volume. and i was told to accept and ignore them.
684	52694	271	buluna	epeozsz	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	that someone was making a wrist watch with two faces so you could set one to local time and one to the time youre from. for international travelers. my boss almost immediately broke it and had to pay.

"apple 100% replaced the iphone 4 for users because of a shitty antenna. we were instructed to dodge, deflect, and deny this was the issue. cellphone providers were shit, the phone was a fluke.it didn't matter. don't admit fault. but if they were there for reception (vs water damage, buttons or battery life) you had to make sure you were swapping them with the ""newer"" batch iphone 4 swaps rather than the typical batch swaps. it was a recall without being a recall. but only if you had reception issues."
686	52694	13253	buluna	epezxkx	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i signed an agreement at my last job that i'd never sue them over anything ever. in exchange i was allowed to get yearly raises. after i left that job i joined a class action suing them for making me sign that and holding raises hostage. made quite a bit from that.

688	52694	8169	buluna	epemxbf	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	posted this before, if it sounds familiar: not me, but a guy i know was on cash cab. a lot of it was faked. he was told he would be on a travel food show and would get picked up by a fake taxi at a certain location at a certain time. there were camera crews all over outside the taxi and there's no way on earth you might mistake it for a real cab.
689	52694	16700	buluna	epeo888	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i worked for a native casino. the golf courses lost a ton of money for us, as did the advertising for the courses. food we generally broke even on because of all the comps. if a crime was committed by a dealer, they would watch the dealer for three months to see if there were accomplices. they used facial recognition and would pair match you so if the same person sat with the same dealer over and over, they would know. this way they could look for accomplices. then when they busted you, they would sit you down and make you watch a video of you breaking the law. they did this because they wanted you to plead guilty as opposed to an expensive trial.
690	52694	2036	buluna	eperkn7	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	amazon made me sign one when i worked with a company that painted their airplanes before the public knew they had them. (i did the faa paperwork.) i was literally only one of like 7 people to see their airplane fully purple with their logo on it. i was actually taken off of the project for a day because they thought i lied about not having a facebook. they meant business

692	52694	16143	buluna	epew61m	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i signed an nda to waitress at a local family owned restaurant. the owner was nuts, definitely had a severe personality disorder, and was worried about his recipies getting leaked. the restaurant is dead now and his secret recipies consisted almost solely of frozen packaged food. edit: guys. stop trying to guess what restaurant it is. you never will. there are millions of family owned places with crazy bosses that go under. you dont know the place and i'm not gonna tell you. also, mr krabs pays his employees enough to own houses and pets. i wish i worked for him.
693	52694	22332	buluna	epemoni	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i was an intern at wells fargo and we were grouped with other interns across the us and given a project to work on aside from our normal intern responsibilities. my group was tasked to look at their current incentive program and the one they were moving to and then come up with various ways they could be improved. two weeks before our presentation someone way above each of our managers had us shred all our work and sign ndas. a couple years later the story broke about their incentive programs where employees were opening up fraudulent accounts for customers in order to gain more incentive rewards.

697	52694	7763	buluna	epf66hz	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	signed an nda when i worked as a fit model for katy perrys shoe line. basically a fit model is used for their good proportions to test out the fit of garments. im a solid size 7.5 so hooray for being average. i was hired on two occasions and got to hang out and give her my opinion on the fit, feeling, and comfort of different shoes. didnt think shed actually be there but both times she was present and totally running the show. super nice woman in person and remembered me when we met again. also she apologized for making me wait so long which i thought was nice (it was a late night meeting as shed just wrapped shooting a music video). her dog is really cute too and i got to save it when it got stuck behind a wall panel.
698	52694	2453	buluna	epeqmd8	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	dnd 5e had a kick ass online character builder that made character creation a breeze. it listed all of the possible skills etc per race and class that was intuitive and made theory crafting for characters easy. personal conjecture: they canned it because it took away from the pen and paper aspect of the game and they were afraid with an online tool it'd take away from book sales.
699	52694	14575	buluna	epet2ze	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	"worked at a matchmaking company. its all bullshit its just throwing darts at a wall until something sticks. theres no science or magic to it alt all. edit: i didn't work for a internet matching company, so they may have a different process. what we did was get a paid client and set him up on dates, the dates we found were from a pool of women and we would just keep picking one after another. i quit because i felt like the women were just being used, and i became uncomfortable profiting off of people's hopes. they very much play up on finding you ""true love"" and it's a process. blah blah. they'll very much play up the fairy-tale romance. it did change me, i don't really date anymore because i don't trust the true intentions of people anymore, i became very jaded to dating after all of that."

"worked for a short time as a qa tester at ea, and wasn't allowed to talk about the game i was testing: the console port for the sims 4. there wasn't really much to talk about, but since the first few versions were basically just running the pc version on a console, there were a lot of bugs with it. one of the worst was a lighting bug we started referring to as ""disco mode"", since it caused a bunch of multicolored squares to show up on everything at night or in dark areas."

"a certain global conferencing company still saves passwords for their web products in plain text. any, and i mean any, employee that works there can see the password. my password there was notmypassyouidiot because i know other people would see it eventually (and they'd even comment/laugh about it.). also, we once discovered that our main conferencing software was letting you sign in regardless of the password you entered. meaning you could sign in with any e-mail address. once we brought it up, we first were immediately stonewalled, and told not to say anything about it in written format. tldr: they had the dev team and legal on a conference call and they decided it was best to just keep it quiet until they fixed it later that day. no client was to be notified of the issue. and the ones that knew of it were basically given a runaround until they gave up. they also added call spoofing to the software. they called it something fancier, but it was call spoofing. you could make a call and make it appear from any number you wanted. my team raised this concern many times, but were countered with ""no one will actually use it for that."" k. that place was a gold mine of security risks."

715	52694	10756	buluna	epem5cv	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	"a huge part of the bachelorette was scripted. the company i worked for at the time was a major tourism service provider and featured prominently in one of the seasons. we were all pulled into meetings with the higher up managers, given a speel about what was in our best interest. and spilling any secrets was punishable by a $5mil lawsuit, ""please sign here"". i gave 0 fucks about the show at the time. still don't. just wanted to do my job. the ""bachelorette"" herself was clearly there to further her public profile or ""acting"" career. the scenes were always ""set up"" before filming. behind the camera nothing was happening. the cast were told where to go, what to do and how to do it. if half those guys weren't on their phones texting their real girlfriends most of the time, i would be surprised. so fake. so 100% fake. &#x200b; edit: well, this is getting a lot more attention than i thought it would. here's a few tidbits: the nda was only that we wouldn't spill secrets about the show before episodes involving our company aired. we were also not allowed to 'disparage' the company, which honestly was easy to abide by since we were treated well and we had excellent managers. the 'bachelorette' has since gone on to a fairly successful tv career, hosting several shows. all of her official press credits ""the bachelorette"" and her exposure during another elimination style reality tv show with launching her career."
716	52694	2361	buluna	eperq6a	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i'm not really sure if what i saw was declassified or expired so i can't give specifics. i participated in arming and training some militia groups in iraq to fight isis that had highly questionable motives and very little vetting done on them. i'm pretty sure that if we didn't need the cannon fodder for the siege of mosul that we would probably be bombing and drone striking some of the groups that we were busy passing out guns to. also i once had an ied dog alert on a truck that had a highly concerning amount of brain matter in/on it. i mean yeah, any amount would be suspect, but there was like 5 or 6 peoples worth of brains there (i've seen head-pops and know how much brains get around, and there was a lot more than that present.) we had dragged him from the vehicle and were preparing to conduct a more thorough search. we were ordered via radio to stand down and let the guy (who was eerily cheerful about driving a truck plastered from bed to hood in human brain matter) continue on his way. he gave me a pack of smokes, smiled, and said he took no offense to our search and understood how troubling the situation must appear, that he felt that we were welcome guests in his country, and that he hoped we had a nice day, then drove off. no fucking clue wtf that was about.
717	52694	1155	buluna	epf6za6	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	when i was a kid, i visited the dentist for a cavity. while there, the dentist slipped while drilling my tooth and drilled a hole under my tongue. my mom saw me tense up, and my dentist said oh, nicked her there a bit so you might see a little blood. i got home and after an hour, my entire neck was swollen up like a frog and my voice was squeaky because of the air pressure. a pocket of air was pressing against my heart. dirty air, at that, because of the bacteria in my mouth. i was admitted to the hospital as a code 4, with a code 5 being dead. when my mom tried to sue the dentist for damages, he claimed i was kicking and screaming and out of control during the appt, even getting his secretary to vouch for him and testify. (total bs. i liked the dentist, and i was a people pleaser. also, laughing gas). my moms lawyer was super pessimistic and told her just to settle and sign an nda because she had a small chance of winning. so my mom settled, being naive and scared to take on an office full of liars. she could never disclose who the dentist was, and weve heard other horror stories throughout the years about this dentist effing up other peoples mouths. it sucks because every lawyer weve talked to after-the-fact says we had a very strong case and its likely we would have won. like really won.
718	52694	4011	buluna	epdzi55	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i've worked with many isps at the past one of which i'm still under nda for but as for the other ones. * the equipment replacement fee? divide it by 3, that's how much we paid for the box vs how much we are going to charge you * if your having a issue/something is broken and you want more money, just escalate the issue about twice for maximum return. don't go past the supervisors-supervisor however because while there may be a level above them still within the call center. if you hit corporate be prepared because they are not required to be nice. as an example of the above the story i tell is an angry lady who was out of service for about six hours. she was not happy with our get off our phone offer and escalated again, by so doing she passed on about 65$ worth of credits (2/3 of her total bill) and a going forward discount on her total bill that would save her about 7$ a month for another 80$ over the next year. that was not good enough she escalated past us and the word came back via email, her credit for time out of service was instead calculated down to the minute meaning instead of 65$ her new offer was now one dollar and twelve cents and no discount off the monthly bill. if she attempts to escalate again i was told inform her we would take advantage of our service policy and cancel her account, please return your modem with 30 days or face a 99.99 replacement charge.

"my dad did some top-secret contract work for the dod back in the 1960s, and he signed a lifelong nda as part of that job. he's dead now so i guess it's safe to talk about it. the thing is, he never did break the nda in any context; the strange part was that the nda specifically prohibited him from using certain words ever again. the trouble is, some of the words are common vocabulary and it became obvious over the years which words he did not use. words i know he could not say (because he would find other ways of saying them instead) included ball, balloon, briefcase, bomb, and nuclear. it would have made more sense for him to just say ""there's a balloon,"" instead of ""there's an inflatable latex object,"" but you gotta do what you gotta do. eventually he did gradually stop avoiding those words for the most part, although he would not discuss the nda."

737	52694	110	buluna	epf2e5r	people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i used to work for a company in the middle east that provided relocation services to people in america. we represented 3 main companies under 9 different names which changed every so often when the reviews got really bad. we had receptionists whose main task, aside from damage control, was to write a few extremely positive reviews for each company every single day in order to counter all the negative ones. i worked in sales. our job was to catalog everything our clients wanted to move and then provide the best possible price while lying through our teeth about the service itself. we promised professional movers who had all the necessary training and tools for the job, great prices, quick deliveries, you name it. on moving day, the movers who showed up were often in unmarked trucks or ones with completely different names and branding on them. the workers were often immigrants who were paid under-the-table and had no experience whatsoever. the deliveries themselves often took a long time and items were often lost as multiple moves would be stacked into one truck without much labeling of items or categorizing in general. as mentioned earlier, we changed company names fairly often as the negative reviews and bad press stacked up. moving is a toxic business, and people will always try to undermine and cheat. this is something you should never cheap out on as the money is well worth the comfort of knowing your move is in good hands. if you are moving, i recommend finding a company that is local if possible, so that you can meet the people who represent it and see that their business is legitimate. more importantly, they will be able to send someone to survey your belongings and give a more realistic quote and time estimate. even if it costs much more than the quotes you receive online or from salesmen, it is well worth the peace of mind on an already stressful venture. edit: spelling and grammar

"my old company i sold mattresses for are still the most overpriced places ever and heavily rely on having their own ""exclusive"" beds so they can't price match. i've sold one for nearly half price and still made decent commission. also, the exclusive beds they sell are exactly the same as the ones in other places, but maybe just rearranged the foam cushions or just got em in different colors and that's it, but they'll be priced an extra few hundred bucks. we were told that tempurpedic messed up and that's why they dropped them as a vendor, when in all reality, the company made demands and tempursealy refused to screw over their other customers and dropped the contract. we sold clearance beds. we had to say they were overstocks, floor models that never made it to the floors, rejected deliveries, etc. truth is, sure, a handful we're floor models, but 95% of em we're returns that people slept on for a minimum of 30 days. and no, they were never cleaned. just sprayed with what's essentially an industrial version of a knock off lysol with reduced scent so it's not obvious. idk how they haven't gotten caught by the health department yet. and finally, if you go to a mattress place for a new bed, don't go for anything priced less than $1k. they're shit. instead, find a $1200 one and haggle em down to about $7-800. you're welcome."

"i had to sign an nda in the army when i was tasked to a special training area that was set up for combat medics. they would take goats and put them into a chemically induced coma. then they would first cut off their limbs to practice proper tourniquet application. then they cut open their stomachs and pulled out intestines to practice evisceration bandaging (fyi, never stuff it back in, you only apply a bandage). there were other things that were not as gruesome like getting a saline lock for iv drips and practicing ncd for tension pneumothorax (hole in the lungs). after they were euthanized they were thrown into a large ""kicker box"" and packed with ice to slow decomposition. &#x200b; the nda was to keep the public from finding out this was going on and potentially stopping the training event. i'm kinda on the fence about the morality of it. on one hand, it's kinda fucked up. there's no other way to put it. but on the other hand, i would prefer a medic who went through that kind of training to come to my aid if i caught a bullet to the chest. i know the training is gruesome but has its benefits and has definitely saved lives on the battlefield. &#x200b; \*edit to address the three main questions flooding my inbox: the reason you don't stuff it back in is explained pretty well by u/d-usa where he says: >there are two main concerns for emergency treatment: keep it moist (drying out delicate tissue like that will kill it), and dont do anything to restrict blood flow. if you try to shove it back in you can easily end up twisting it or pinching it off, and then blood cant flow and tissue ends up dying. also, i know it's not a well-kept secret and everyone knows about it. the purpose of the nda is to keep it a secret long enough to finish training without peta and other extremists from picketing outside the gates. i fully agree that human lives and medical advancement are well worth the sacrifice of these animals."
