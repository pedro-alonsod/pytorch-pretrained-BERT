7691	20447	1340	bqhfq9	eo5cbqu	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"back during wow's second expansion there was this guy in my guild i'd become friends with mostly through other friends. we talked more and more over time and became fairly close. he had this asshole roommate, and i could hear the guy sometimes, especially when something went wrong during a raid. he'd scream and throw fits, he was pretty awful sounding. my friend told me he wasn't just loud and obnoxious, but verbally and sometimes physically abusive, too. i had my own apartment, so i said you know what, come stay with me. just long enough to get you on your feet and into a place that's safe. he showed up at my place with a trash bag full of his stuff and a laptop. i set him up in the apartment and started trying to help him find a job. well, he did not want a job. he did not get a job, either. he sat in my apartment, day after day, eating my food and slowly draining my savings. no matter how hard i tried to get him motivated, he would just dig in his heels and somehow become more sedentary. eventually i told him he had to go. i couldn't afford to keep him there. he was just couch surfing. i spoke to some people and eventually pieced together that his method of securing a new ""temporary"" place was playing on the sympathies of his friends to convince them he was in a terrible living situation. it just worked really well on me because he had that loud, obnoxious roommate to play off of. he wound up calling a nearby relative to come and get him, i think his aunt. i don't know what he told her i supposedly did, but i have never seen a more venomous look from someone in my life. as far as i know he moved in with his sister and brother in law after that, but frankly i don't care where he ended up. he also stole a bunch of my stuff. first and last time i do anything like that."
7692	20447	2238	bqhfq9	eo5dxlj	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is more of an embarrassment story. when i was in high school in the 90s i was active on the local dial up bbs scene. i was friends with someone who went by the handle venus. i knew she was a woman but had no idea what she looked like. i also knew she was dating a guy in real life with the handle lord gumby who was also a friend online. being a socially misadjusted 15 year old i had a crush on her anyway even though i knew they were both like 18. this was like 1992 so privacy wasnt as big a concern and they knew my address. this was also when people would randomly come by your house to see if you were home. thats unfathomable today. so one saturday morning im at home on my computer totally disheveled, unshowered, and just gross in ratty sweatpants and no shirt. i hear a knock on the front door and go open it. theres a woman who was incredibly beautiful standing there and she just goes hi! im venus! i stood there for a minute it seemed like jaw dropped trying to say something when lord gumby walked up and was like hey doofus, ever met a woman before? needless to say i wanted to sink into a hole in the ground and die. but i hung out with them and i guess i wasnt too horrible because we hung out a lot after that. but that whole time i was like fuck my life choices! havent talked to them in decades. i wonder how theyre doing.

"met this dude on everquest and we've played games together ever since. been a part of the same guild, help each other out on mobile games, and have conversations about life in general. it isn't him that's the horror story, it was his mom! so one day, i think we were playing wow at the time, i log on to do some quests. suddenly his user comes on and ask to chat by video. we've done this before and there's no problem but after i click to start the video chat: there's his mom butt naked on the screen. she asks me to watch her masturbate and i'm like ""no lady this is just awkward af"" and i log off for a few days. i get an email from my friend and he wants to know why i haven't shown up for quests or anything. so i tell him what happened and he is seriously like ""wtf?"" turns out his mom had been doing this to a lot of his online buddies and she eventually goes to prison for raping a minor or two. buddy's doing great though: wife and kids plus we still play the occasional game together."
7694	20447	328	bqhfq9	eo5hlqx	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i never actually met the guy, but spoke to him on the phone. wed met on myspace when i was in college and exchanged email addresses when we realized we lived in the same town. eventually, i gave him my phone number and made plans for him to call me. when he did, his voice creeped me out. it was how i imagined a serial killer would sound. by the time i got passed it and was comfortable talking to him on the phone i started noticing other red flags. whenever i brought the neighborhood up, he changed the subject. at one point, i asked him what his favorite restaurant on the boulevard was and he hedged, so i made up a restaurant that i said was my favorite. he immediately said that was his favorite too and that he especially loved one of their dishes. he went on and on about this wonderful place that didnt exist (and there wasnt a similar one in town, so he couldnt be confused). i called him out on the fact that hed obviously never been to my neighborhood. turned out, he didnt even live in the same state as me.
7695	20447	6531	bqhfq9	eo5gisq	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	a guy in a forum for a specific hobby would talk to me a lot, but never revealed his real identity. until out of the blue he suddenly asked me to please come to see him in hospital, where he died a few weeks later.
7696	20447	17609	bqhfq9	eo589ud	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"guy i knew in college met a girl online and spent every day talking about her. she lived about 6 hours away, so he planned to take a semester off and pursue this relationship. he got a job in her town and asked if i'd hep him mov out there since my car would hold more than he could take on a bus. i had a long weekend off and figured, why not? a road trip cold be fun. i'd drive him out as a goodbye present, and the way back i planned to visit yellowstone. well. we arrive and it turns out he doesn't have an apartment lined up and. he found a job *posting* in his girlfriend's town, he hadn't actually gotten the job. or even applied yet. i make a bunch of phone calls and find him a room to rent that will let him move in that day with just first, last, and deposit, even without a job. i'm tired and disgusted with his lack of planning, but figure it's worth staying the night and trying to end things on good terms with my buddy. then he breaks down and confesses that he hasn't actually met this girl. the nights he spent ""video chatting"" with her were really just him watching her vlog and jacking it. they've never talked. never texted. never even emailed. hell, he's never even left so much as a comment or ""like"" on one of her videos. she genuinely didn't (still doesn't) know he existed. his plan was to hang out at this game shop she talks a lot about until she showed up and someohow create a relationship from that. he thought that they'd meet and she'd fall in love with him and move back to our college town to marry him. all before the next semester began. that didn't happen. instead, i made my ""buddy"" buy a bus ticket for his ride back to school and left. he came back to school and got more cringey, not less. i lost track of him after that."
7697	20447	23353	bqhfq9	eo4wck5	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i met a guy online, we really got on and he came over a few times so we could hang out. i did find him attractive and tried to hint that i was into him (note, i can't flirt to save my life) but nothing ever happened. after a few ""dates"" he suddenly vanished offline. no social media, he wasn't answering texts or emails, nothing. i thought he'd ghosted me. after 6 months he reappears, i asked him where he'd been and he said ""i don't want to talk about it"". a few weeks after, there was a fad where people were googling their names and posting humorous stories they had found about similar people with their name (mine was about a ship that had my initials) and i started to google friends names just out of boredom/morbid curiosity, googled his name and found a local news story from his area, one of those ""crime and courts"" things that he had been done for statutory rape of a minor, online grooming and had his computer and phone seized as evidence."
7698	20447	259	bqhfq9	eo5wdmr	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	when i was younger i met an online friend in a public place for the first time. he was about my age and hadnt lied about that, so i guess i let my guard down. anyway, after we walked for awhile i notice he had led me down a dark alley with no other people. he then looked at me and said how he really wanted to rape me right then and there. right after hed said that, my instinct kicked in, and i ran as fast as ive ever run in my life, until i came to the train station. here i jumped on the first train i saw and got the hell away from him.
7699	20447	12646	bqhfq9	eo4xb92	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is way back in the mid 90s. bulletin board systems were all the rage. i made friends with this guy from nc - he was friends with a bunch of us from my dorm, mostly females, which should probably have been a red flag but i was extremely naive at the time. a couple months in, he mentioned he was coming to our state for a wedding and asked if he could come by our college to meet everyone. it was agreed hed sleep in my dorm room since my roommate was almost never around. now, there was no discussion or thought of sex, but i was pretty excited to meet this guy and see if he was as funny and charming as he was online. well. day arrives, dude shows up. i should mention that i and all my college friends were 18 or 19, this guy was 24. or so he said. guy looked like, and im not exaggerating, a cancer patient. pale, gaunt features, long greasy pale blond hair except where he was bald on top, and just generally looked like he was about to die or he was dressed as a ghoul for halloween. he insisted on hugging all of us. i was trying to remind myself that looks dont matter and that he was a cool guy despite his very unsettling appearance. but then, when we all started hanging out, things just got worse. he was asking really invasive questions of all of us, making weird comments to whatever was said, just all around creepy and distressing. i was sitting on the floor with another friend and actively rocking back and forth from discomfort. i lied and said i had hurt my back and that sleeping on the floor helped, because that night he kept insisting we could share my tiny twin college bed. nope nope nope nope nope. last time i ever met anyone from that site.
7700	20447	4218	bqhfq9	eo58lqs	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	he and i were part of the same forum many, many years ago. he was dealing with his issues and i was dealing with mine. i think we both went there to escape, where people wouldnt judge. also, because we were bored. im not quite sure when we got properly talking, i think its when he told a terrible joke about kipper ties. we used to share everything with each other, over msn. id give him advice about his love life and hed listen to all my fuck ups. it took quite a few fuck ups before we eventually met up. i think i already knew we were in love but seeing him in person really cemented it. we decided to give it a go, even though we lived 300 miles away from each other. we had a lot of ups and downs. i was distant, he lived with his ex girlfriend for a bit even though she didnt have a job and couldnt afford her half of the rent. the same ex gf who id given him advice on, who he had nicknamed trouble and liked to claim she was pregnant every so often. we got over that, along with many other things, and finally moved in with each other. i thought our issues were gonna be solved when there was no distance between us. ends up, we were just very different people who wanted very different things and the distance wasn't gonna change that. we broke up after three and a half years together. none of thats the horror story. not the way he treated me, not the fact he probably cheated on me, not that i wasnt a priority and used to cry myself to sleep. about a year and a half after breaking up, he gets back in touch and we talk like it was in the beginning, when we were friends. after a few weeks, he asked if i want to get back together. i said no. i told him that hed broken my heart again. the next day, i got a phone call from his work because i was still his emergency contact asking me if i knew where he was because he hasnt turned up. the police got in touch too. the last phone call that day was from his mum, to let me know that hed killed himself.
7701	20447	4371	bqhfq9	eo5cbn1	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	ive been active in numerous online communities over the years, and have been fortunate enough to hang out with many of the friends ive made there in person. theres only been one incident i couldnt cope with. he picked me up at the airport, which was very nice of him, and as soon as we got into the car, he started picking his nose. theres a lot that goes through your mind when you hop into a vehicle with someone youve never been alone with and you immediately catch them two knuckles deep in their rostrum. i looked quickly away so that he wouldnt know i caught him and be embarrassed, if he was just trying to sneak one out before i noticed. if he did notice, he didnt seem embarrassed, so i relaxed a little. i guessed maybe he was just so confident about himself and our friendship that hed ascended past caring if i saw him take care of a quick boog. fine, sure. when i finally looked back at him, he was wiping his fingers across his dashboard. to this day im not really sure what to think, but this guy spent the entirety of the few hours we were together scooping out boogers and wiping them off on parts of his car or the table or wherever it was that wed stopped at. i realized i was being transported in a rolling booger shrine and that there was nothing i could touch without needing to wash my hands. i was sitting on a crust of fossilized booger stuff. i had to be. i didnt want to hurt his feelings, he was a nice dude, but i wound up ollying out of our visit early because i couldnt handle it. i dont consider myself a clean freak, but as wiping started to stack it was all i could do not to throw open the passenger door and roll myself out into traffic to escape. i still wonder if i should have done or said anything to save him some grief in the future but it didnt feel like it was my place, you know? what do you even say?
7702	20447	1635	bqhfq9	eo5lwyt	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"\*flashback 15 years ago\* i was talking to a person online i'd known for a few years. we weren't best friends, but we talked daily. seemed like a nice guy. at some point he he asked where i was from, and i mentioned that i lived in philly and i was going to the art institute there, living in the dorms. didn't give specifics other than that. most people knew i was an art student at the time (i posted it about regularly on livejournal). a few days later i come home from class and see a message on aim. ""figured out where you live. i'm outside of the dorms at the cafe across the street. meet me."" this guy lived on the west coast, and after finding out where i lived, he makes an unannounced trip across the country, tracked down the building where i lived in, and was camped out at the cafe across the street. asking him to meet him. all of this *without any head's up.* i immediately felt uncomfortable, and didn't really know what to do. it's one thing to meet up, another thing entirely to make a trip cross country and camp out in front of a person's residence. i didn't answer the aim message right away and needed some time to calm down and think, get more rational. more messages started coming through, each reading slightly more hostile than the last. okay, this guy traveled all this way. it'd be a dick move to ignore him, but at the same time, i felt like i was seeing red flags everywhere. i was legitimately creeped out. more messages came, and each time, they started to get more agitated, more impatient. he started asking for my class schedule so he could meet me outside class, asking where i'd be going, where i usually ate, what time my dinner schedule was. he started getting weirdly specific about wanting to know about every facet of my life. i was getting full-on stalker vibes. so i lied, and told him that i was visiting my sister and that i'd be back over the weekend, and *i'd just miss him.* that's when he said ""that's fine. i can wait."" and he did. three days later, he's still there, still messaging me that he's ""still at the cafe. waiting."" *what the fuck are you waiting for? why are you here? why didn't you tell me you were coming?* my privacy was having huge issues with all of this, and it got to the point i started feeling legitimately scared. i made a decision. rather than meet him, i'd log out out aim, create a new handle, pretend i never existed at that point. i completely abandoned my livejournal and started posting under a new name, and went so far as to change my entire online persona. i never heard from him again."

7704	20447	2972	bqhfq9	eo5ar4y	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"after 4+ years of playing wow together and chatting (online and on the phone) he invited me to visit him in australia. i figured it was safe, since i'd known him for quite a while and had never gotten any weird vibes - no flirtation, no creeper-ness, nothing. two days into my very-clearly-stated platonic visit, he tried to rape me. i ditched all of my stuff except what i had in a small duffel bag and took off, traveling on my own for the two weeks until my flight home. a few months later, i received an unsigned postcard from the gold coast that just said, ""thinking of you"", with a smiley face."
7705	20447	6094	bqhfq9	eo4r1se	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"not a horror story, but definitely weird. at 13 years old, i went to a show where my male online friend was also supposed to go. not a big show and i was with my father, don't worry. we were supposed to meet at one of the entrances, but he never showed up. when i asked him about it later, he said he must have been at the wrong entrance. over time we stopped talking for no reason really. a few years later, one of our mutual online friend told me she learned that the guy in question was actually a girl. i don't care about the gender, the thing is that she wasn't the one on any of the pictures she sent to us and our other friends, and her name wasn't her real name, she totally invented another identity. the worst part is that another of our friend even told us she got pregnant from ""him"". i don't know if she asked her to fake a pregnancy, or if it was her own idea, but that was really weird. wonder what other thing she lied to us about."
7706	20447	2061	bqhfq9	eo55m9h	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i used to play a war game and i was friends with this other person (was a guy) and we became good friends and talked and all then out of the blue he asked me to be his girlfriend (he was a truck driver in the usa and i was only 12) it freaked me out a lot and i ghosted him. it was a terrifying experience and a real eye opener for me.
7707	20447	5008	bqhfq9	eo4rvuq	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i used to play wow with my now ex. our guild leader actually wound up moving to our state with his wife. my ex and i broke up before we got the chance to hang out with the guy, and right after the break up he messaged my ex essentially asking if it was cool if he and his wife got me drunk and took advantage of me. ex showed me screenshots when i was getting my stuff from his place and i cancelled my plans to meet the guy and his wife. my ex had been physically abusive and broke up with me to date the girl he'd cheated on me with. i'd tried leaving before but he'd fake suicide attempts and i was so scared he'd go through with it so i stayed. even though he was in a new relationship he tried to keep tabs on me and control me, but i saw it as my chance to escape. i happened to move right after we split and he didn't know my new address. i blocked him on everything. somehow he kept getting information on me though. turns out the guild leader was feeding him everything, i hadn't deleted the guy off facebook cause i figured he was only a problem in person. when i confronted him over messenger, bringing up the abuse, and the guy said, ""he said he choked you because you guys were arguing and he was afraid he wouldn't get the chance to speak. he still loves you."" side note, the choking was cause i was defending myself against accusations of cheating, which i hadn't done."
7708	20447	7488	bqhfq9	eo4j9cr	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i dont know if its a horror story, but it how i ended up where i live now. i played wow for years with a pretty regular group, got to know them offline and at one point two of them, a couple, invited me to move across the country. at the time i didnt have anything tying me to where i was, so i packed up and moved. got out here, moved in with my friends and everything seemed okay. my buddy was a long haul driver so he was always gone for days at a time. his girl would try to set me up multiple times with two of her friends at the same time (one in minnesota). i ended up having a hard time finding work for a while, finally got a job though and was putting some money away while helping watch their kids. out of nowhere one day my buddy accuses me of trying to fool around with his girl. nothing had ever happened, but i had noticed her spending more and more time in my room when he wasnt there. i knew his history and his previous relationship had ended after she cheated with a friend of his. he wouldnt listen, so i got kicked out without any warning and they stole about $1k worth of my stuff and later moved. ultimately it all worked out for me. cut the friend and his girl out of my life completely and moved on. now i have a good job here, wife and kids. *edit* clarified that i cut out the friend and the girl lol not my wife and kids
7709	20447	7322	bqhfq9	eo4u09p	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	we were friends online for years. wed meet up every so often and when we started families wed meet up and take the kids to the zoos or whatever. she wanted us to go on a cruise together, with our husbands and kids. i made the comment towards the effect of we cant afford that, and she went nuts. we shouldnt have had kids if we cant afford them, we shouldnt have more children, our life sucks blah blah blah because i didnt want to go on a goddamn cruise with her and her bratty ass kid. sounds like a nightmare.
7710	20447	475	bqhfq9	eo5dv3h	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i was the horror in this story. i was part of an online writing community that i really enjoyed and i made a lot of good friends through the years. one man and his wife were visiting from another country so another guy from my area and i were going to take them to dinner and have a nice in-person evening with sight-seeing and conversation. things kind of blew up for me at that time. my (now ex) husband and i were having major issues and i was near my mental and emotional breaking point. i had lost 15 lbs in three weeks just from pure stress. on top of that, my family had chosen that evening to have a get together for my uncle who would soon be travelling to undergo surgery for cancer. i showed up in body, but that was basically it. my mind was a million miles away. i wasnt talkative at all, and i left after about an hour. i feel like i lost three good friends that evening because of my behaviour at dinner and my subsequent withdrawal from the whole community. im sure they look back on that evening and think what a nightmare host i was. *edited to add several missing ts
7711	20447	1824	bqhfq9	eo56klc	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i was on meetme, met this guy who was super cool. we ended up texting every single day and i took the train out to los angeles to meet him. when i got there, he was being kinda shitty and he told me that he hadn't gotten much sleep becuz he was partying until 5am. we walked to his house and when i walked into his room, i was kind of shocked. it was a 8x6.5 room. all he had was a mat on the floor and a small little jewelry box full of mementos on top of his suitcase of clothes. we took a nap together. later, we went to get ramen and he asked me to pay. i didn't mind. we went back to his place and we listened to music while we waited to go to a party. fast forward to that night.we met up with some of his friends and they were so mean to him. they kept roasting him and picking on him and he was visibly getting upset. i stopped him for a bit so his friends could walk ahead of us. i reminded him that it was all fun nd games and to ignore them. ended up at the party and lots of people knew him. i sat out in the patio with a few cool people that i had just met while i waited for my friend to come back from saying hello to everyone inside.he never did. i was outside in the patio with these strangers for about 3 hours. people kept coming up to me and asking if i was alright. idk if i looked sad or if i just looked like a plain loner. i went to find him and it was so packed. didn't see him so i walked back. i seen his roommate and asked him to please tell my friend that i was gonna go get a motel. he went to tell him, came back and said my friend was being a dick & he would walk me back to the house instead so i didn't have to spend money on a hotel. we got to the house and i thanked him for walking all the way back home. i really appreciated it as my friend was probz inside doing coke or fucking girls. i went to bed in my friends room and he woke me up in the middle of the night kissing me, trying to get his freak on. i simply said no. i'm not interested in having sex. his exact words were, ""are you serious? what was the point of you coming here?? you're such a waste of time!"" my feelings were really hurt. i went back to sleep, woke up and left. never wrote him after that. he had texted me a month later asking to borrow $50. i simply ignored the message and moved on."
7712	20447	314	bqhfq9	eo631x9	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	sorry in advance, this is a long one. i was talking to this girl i met on quizilla back in 2008/9. we met because she made one of thosewhich twilight characters are you? quizzes, and i was asking for help on making mine. we got to talking and realized that we were roughly the same age, lived in the same state only a couple hours apart, and had quite a few things in common. fast forward a few months, i start thinking of her as one of my genuine best friends, and we start to broach the subject of meeting irl. my parents- understandably- have their doubts, and only agree to let me meet her if i agree to bring my older brother along. (i was 13, he was 18). i agree, and the girl and i arrange to meet at a museum that is equidistant from both of us. so the day comes, and its time for me to finally meet this girl ive been talking to for a solid 6-7 months. my brother agrees that hes not going to breathe down my neck, but that ill always be within eyeshot. i see her at the entrance when i walk up, and everything seems to be going well! after all, shes not an 80 year old man, and she looks exactly like her pictures, which is really all that i could possibly expect from the situation. later on in the day, my brother meets up with us so that he could drive us somewhere to get lunch, and everything immediately went downhill from there. this was the first time my brother had really seen her up close, and not from a few meters away, and he gets a really confused look on his face. he doesnt react further, but stays pretty much quiet the rest of the drive. i think nothing of it, and just assume that hes letting us talk and doesnt want to interrupt. when we get to the restaurant, she doesnt want to sit on my side of the booth with me, instead choosing to sit next to my brother. she claims that this is because she wants to be able to look at me while shes talking, but my brother is looking more and more uncomfortable with the situation. i decide to sit next to him instead, and dont really give her an option. suddenly, the conversation starts to drift from me and her, to just about my brother. what he does for school, where he works, his friends, etc. i start getting really jealous, and eventually blow up saying are you here to talk to me, or to just my brother??? she starts backpedaling, and apologizes for ignoring me. at that moment, my brother finally realizes that he recognizes her as a girl that had been stalking him on myspace for the past few months, but without all of the terrible filters/makeup/angles that he was use to seeing her with. he immediately gets super freaked out, and starts saying that we need to leave, and that she needs to find her own way home. we end up leaving as soon as her parents come to pick her up, and i never hear from her again. and thats the story of how my junior high online best friend was also my brothers weird myspace stalker. needless to say, he still brings it up to this day, and uses it against me at every opportunity.
7713	20447	796	bqhfq9	eo5dhwv	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i (25) was best friends with a woman (46) for nearly six years. we would talk for hours and send each other gifts constantly. we shared everything from art to personal trauma. we were very close. when i fell in hard times, she was very kind and offered to take me in. i was so grateful that she would do this for me. after a few months, things started to change. i started to see why she was such a lonely person. she was mean, if not cruel, to anyone who ever disagreed with her or even had a different opinion. she was so mentally unstable that she couldn't even buy something without having to call her elderly mother and ask for permission. i found out that she was scamming the disability services to get money from the government because she didn't want her mother tracking her spending. she was so horrible to her caregiver. i'll admit that the guy was a complete moron, but he was still a sweet guy that was just trying to help. she was so abusive towards him that i had to step in on multiple occasions, which she fucking hated because it meant i wasn't on her side. that's when she turned on me. she began to freak out over small stuff. screaming and crying because i missed a spot while mopping or because i spilled a little bit if water in the kitchen or ate my food too fast. she was fucking insane! as soon as i realized how messed up and unstable she was (after being screamed at and chased back to my room) i told her that i was going to be moving out as soon as possible. so, for the next week, she decided to make my life a living hell. she would scream about me to other people on the phone, telling lies about me, saying i did things i never did. and because she was a youtuber with a big following, she doxed me on social media, telling people i punched holes in her walls and keyed her car. she even called the cops and tried to get me arrested for things i didn't do. her followers began to harass me, sending me rape/death threats. then she started posting and sharing all of my personal secrets that i had shared with her in confidence. i ended up having to call my family to come get me because she was wanting to keep my dog so that i would have to keep in contact with her and i was no longer feeling save. so, after six months of living in hell and three years of internet harassment and stalking that followed, i'll never meet someone i met online ever again. i have no interest in online friends. it's not safe because you never know how absolutely fucked up someone is until it's too late
7714	20447	3189	bqhfq9	eo4e7h7	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i met a really cool group of people from a chat group website called xat that lives in minimal distance away from me like maybe 15 mins and the horror story part is that i was in my emo phase and probably made a great lasting impact on their lives as a hot topic connoisseur

7716	20447	538	bqhfq9	eo50wzo	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	back in about 1998, i met someone playing an online word game. we were both 16 year old girls and we just hit it off and became very close. finally in 2004 she was passing though where i lived so i invited her to stay for a few days. she shows up totally coked up. then she invites some guy over and they were snorting cocaine off her car key in my living room. i didn't know she used coke and i was so uncomfortable the entire time. it was like having a stranger there, yet we knew everything about each other. we remained in touch and i still really like her but it was just such an awkward visit. we haven't seen each other since, though. edit: fixed a typo
7717	20447	3687	bqhfq9	eo4kwv1	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	he was driving cross country with a friend. i said i had a couch/floor they could crash on if needed. he was great, she was an annoying bitch. she hated everything, was annoyed by my cat, didnt like anything i had to eat or drink, etc. they were literally there for like 16 hours.
7718	20447	411	bqhfq9	eo63ofq	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"oh finally i have somewhere to tell this story, but it's probably too late to get any real traction. long story short, when i was doing a lot of online dating i had multiple accounts across multiple platforms. one happened to be fetlife. i used pictures there that i hadn't put online before, with my face cropped out. it didnt pan out however, i didn't really like any of the guys that messaged me, i was polite to them all but ultimately kind of abandoned my profile. cue tinder, i match with a guy that looks white collar, tailored, professional. just my type. we match, talk for a week or so until we decide to get drinks. i get to the bar (took an uber there) and look around. dont see him. until this scraggly looking guy comes up to me and says ""oh hey grenadinegarden! i thought youd never make it!"" now, i'm not unusually one to judge by appearances, we all have rough days and lord knows i dont wear makeup or do my hair on the busiest of them, but his hair was significantly longer (think short, well manicured hair versus mid back length uncombed waves), he was covered in a patchy beard, and dressed really badly. i honestly didnt recognize him, and he waved it off with ""sorry. those pictures are kind of old"". red flag stupidly ignored, we grab a small table with huge chair and start drinking and talking. one drink, just to be polite, but i'm turned off at this point wholly. then, the kicker. he leans in toward me, puts his hand on my thigh, and says, ""you know, after you didnt message me back on fetlife, i'm surprised we matched on tinder. you really are quite beautiful."" at this point i'm like ""?!?!?!?! i'm sorry????"" he chuckles, literally chuckles like a villain in a movie, pats my thigh, and says ""i'm going to the bathroom. you should look at your profile and figure it out. i found you because your body is quite distinct."" it's worth noting we live in a major international tourist city. there are thousands upon thousands of new people here every day. especially on tinder. this is not a small town. i used to match with people that would swipe between connecting flights! so i'm beyond nervous, watch him get up and go, and i quickly check my fetlife inbox and lo and behold, he had messaged me months ago. his profile picture looked like an absolute serial killer. i remember why i rejected him. incompatible on all fronts. and i was polite. so anyways, i got to use the whole ""angel shot"" protocol. in which i basically ran to the bartender, explained the situation, and left through the back door. i was beyond uncomfortable. and deleted all of my social media for a few months. and i consider myself lucky that he only sent a few ""you're a whore etcetc"" messages for the rest of the evening but gave up after that. and i paid for my own drink, too. i'm not a monster."
7719	20447	2230	bqhfq9	eo4uap0	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"it's not a horror story, it's a story about how i was put off meeting people from the internet i was friends with a bunch of people i met through an online game. after about 2 years, i decided to meet 2 of them. the 2 i was meeting were a long distance couple, one from one country and the other from mine. they had met many times and had spent 2 weeks together prior to meeting with me. we met in the city, said hi and hugged and did some touristy stuff, took their pictures etc etc. but throughout the whole time, they weren't really talking to me. at first, i put it down to anxiety as i was nervous too. but even after lunch, they were only talking to each other and i felt left out. i even took a sneaky video of them talking to each other and sent it a friend, who agreed it was odd. when it was time for me to leave, i told them i had to go but i had a nice time, and they continued to chat to each other. i said it again but no response, so i started to walk away, until one of them said ""oh byeee"" i was really hurt. it was like they didn't want me to be with them. i had spent a lot of money getting down, especially since at the time i didn't have a job. when i got back, i stopped talking to them. the friend who i sent the video to sent a message to them asking why they were ignoring me, and they tried to turn it on me saying that i was the quiet one and that i was being rude to them, especially ""leaving without saying goodbye"". i blocked them all on the game. a few months go bye and one of them finds my social media and tries to reconnect. starts off well, and then goes back to blaming me. haven't met anyone from the internet since"
7720	20447	576	bqhfq9	eo5boa8	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not a horror story but about a year after i made the move from massachusetts to south carolina i was playing video games and a guy on my team talked about how he just moved into a house in the same area that i moved from. so i pmd him and turns out that he moved into my old place and was playing in my old room with his desk in the same spot i had mine.

7722	20447	125	bqhfq9	eo5swfz	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i'd been chatting to a girl for quite some time and finally ended up visiting her house about 50 miles away for an evening of enjoying each others company. we wake up the next morning to loud noises, which turned out to be her fiance i knew nothing about, ripping a window off it's hinges and climbing in as she'd locked him out (locked the door and left the key in the lock) and there was a strange car on the driveway, so he thought she might be in trouble. alas, it was me in trouble as this guy was huge, and a bit upset by this point. i managed to talk him down and explained the situation, to then find she had called the police and accused him of breaking and entering. during the time the police were questioning him, i made my escape and high-tailed it out of there.
7723	20447	449	bqhfq9	eo5uph7	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i never actually met him but i used to play runescape when i was younger (around 11ish). i didnt pay for the member account so there were a bunch of items and things i couldnt get. some member started gifting me things and i was super grateful. every time i went on he would help me with my quests and whatever. but over time he started asking more personal questions like what i looked like, what i liked to do etc. etc. in return he told me his first name, that he was 14 and that he was in the army as some cadet programme or something but back visiting family blah blah. i knew nothing about the army, a cadet programme at that age didnt sound that far fetched to little ol me. he started to escalate how he was talking to me and started sending me messages like hi sexy, miss you come back and talk to me babe. etc. i stopped replying because i was creeped out and was 11. i still thought boys were gross. anyway in school the next day i was making small talk with a girl i sat next to and she mentioned how her brother was home and how much shed missed him while hed been away in the army. i got a sinking feeling then which continued when she told me his name (a match). in desperation i asked her if he ever played runescape in which she said he did and his username was friendsusername she showed me a picture and told me about how she was really excited about how hed finally found his calling in the army. dude was 26. yikes
7724	20447	932	bqhfq9	eo52mc3	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i have two. one was this guy from an mmo i played. he was older than me, married, had a kid, stuck up for me a lot. everyone said not to trust him, but i thought i knew him better than that. he told me he thought i was really smart, and he wanted to make a journal with me. because a journal needs a lot of content, though, he asked me to write extra stuff to save for future publications. i had nothing going on so i said i'd do it, even though his prompts were super specific and kind of boring. one day, though, he called me and asked me to go into his email because he didn't get online and he needed something. i saw a folder with my name on it, so i clicked it. it was filled with emails to other people, with my writing attached, and negotiations for payment. he was selling my writing to college kids for $500 - $1000 each. the second guy, i met from the same game. he was in a bad place and i felt sorry for him. i offered to let him join me and my new roommate in our apartment search. the rent was going to be super cheap. he was really messy, though (filthy, even) and i told him that since the landlord was really strict, he'd have to make sure to keep things somewhat clean. he went to my roommate behind my back, said i was too controlling, and offered to replace me with his way cooler friend (who would pay more, of course). i just considered this a bullet dodged and moved on. i got an even better, somehow cheaper apartment. when he saw the photos online, he freaked out, started stalking my mom (sending me notes on where she was throughout the day), and when i called the cops on him, he called in a bomb threat to my work. i lost my job and my apartment. don't worry, i'm not dumb anymore.
7725	20447	94	bqhfq9	eo6evp6	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is /u/kikistiel 's story, but it popped into my head because she wins all horror stories imo with this. [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/sadcringe/comments/9b9pk6/the_dirtiest_job/e51q307/?context=3) copy/paste text: this almost was me. almost. long story time: i am an artist, and my main job before the one i have now was selling my work at comic, anime, and video game cons across the us and canada, and sometimes in more countries. it was surprisingly a lucrative job if you did it right and i enjoyed it, and required a lot more work than people realized. but i digress, the point is i was familiar with the convention scene and this leads me to my next point: i used to take commissions at conventions but i stopped doing them years ago because i got too busy and my art had improved enough that $100 felt too low for my skill level, and im all about artists pricing their work fairly and not working for pennies. a couple of years ago, just as i had started phasing out commission work, a man had approached me at a con. you get a lot of socially awkward people at cons, to be expected, but 99.5% of them are really sweet and just like to talk about stuff the dig. if you have a good amount of patience, its enjoyable. but this guy. he immediately asked me if i did commissions. i said no, unfortunately not anymore.he asked me how much my prices were, and usually when people ask i just. quote some arbitrary high number just to get them to throw out the idea without outright telling them no. and if they want to pay it, well. then we can talk. i said $350. he said, cool, done. in cash? i was stammering at him, not expecting him to go for it. eventually i just asked him what he wanted. to make a long story shorter, he wanted furry art. soft core porn to be exact. i had never in my life done furry art, but i knew how lucrative it seemed to be. i said oh, each character would be extra. nsfw would be extra too. this would be a big commission. hes like oh no worries. how much extra? this went back and forth for a while and to save time, he paid me $700, in cash, on the spot, for some furry porn. i wasnt even mad, $700 is nice, so i said sure ill draw the furry porn. what do i care? ill fake sign it, its one and done. after i did it in one night in my hotel room, i found he had taken my business card and had given my email to his friends who may be interested in commissioning art. the requests for weirder and weirder, but the pay stayed surprisingly good. eventually, i ended up making a furaffinity account under a fake name and tweaked my style and techniques enough that no one could ever trace the art back to me. i decided to just fully embrace the furry art bank life. it was open season  i guarantee you i was a no-name in that community and still made good money, so im horrified to think what the really popular artists get. i didnt feel ashamed for drawing weird furry fetish porn, nor did i feel bad for kinda being a fraud. i provided a service, and that was it. things went downhill when i mistakenly befriended someone in the community. she was another furry artist, and we just sort of hit it off in the online community. she seemed like an edgy self-hating furry so our jabbing humor at the expense of furries made us bond. she was cool, all was well. eventually i admitted to her that i didnt actually give a shit about furries, and she took it in stride. said she understood why i used the community to make money because she wished she wasnt a fucking furry either, but you cant help what you like. she told me that if i really wanted to make bank, i should go to a furry convention. i was immediately like fuck no. never in my life, but she told me about an anime con that i regularly attended that next year would be sharing the same venue and weekend as a furry convention. just table hop, she said. she told me to split her table with her, try it out, see how i fared. i already had a table at the anime con, so i was like sure, why the hell not? what could it hurt? we decided to even share a hotel room. this isnt uncommon. in artist alleys many artists room share together since we have similar schedules and dont tend to party hard because we are working. she seemed like a good person and its not uncommon to just meet someone irl when youre rooming with them. i arrived thursday before the con, but the furry con had already started. i got a text from my friend to come sit at her table in the furry con dealers den for a few hours since my con didnt start until friday, just to see if it clicked. she had already checked in to the hotel room and had the keys anyways, so i picked up my badge and went. i was. surprised to find her at the table. in full fursuit. they was the weird part. she was a self hating furry, or so she claimed, so to go full commitment and be in a suit was. ok. hmm. i was already out of my comfort zone in the sea of furries, and my friend was supposed to be like my anchor, my guide through this other world to protect me from this shit. i was immediately on edge. it got worse when i sat down and introduced myself and she did that. thing. that thing that furries do where they are in fur suits and dont talk. she nodded when i made sure she was who i thought she was, but she just did the overly exaggerated cute poses and even had a fucking squeaky toy in her fursuit to make noise. but she didnt say a word. she hugged me, and somehow??? managed to interact with customers who all knew her and adored her (i guess she was well know in the community) and if she wanted to communicate, would write. or text in this big ass oaw things. she said she hates wearing suits but because she doesnt have to talk in them, she doesnt have to interact much with customers. okay. that i could kind maybe believe. sort of. at around 7 pm we packed up to leave to go to the hotel room. she stayed in suit the whole way up. in the room i flopped down on my bed exhausted. i asked her if she was going to come out of that thing, understandably a little freaked out. from this whole thing. then she did the thing that made me want to run out of the room, which i didnt against my better judgment. i had flopped on the bed with the upper half of my body, my feet still on the floor, my shirt had ridden up my torso. she stepped in between my legs and fucking tickled me on my exposed belly. i flipped the fuck out, as one does when sneak attacked by tickles and wriggled out of her reach. she made that laughing pose that furries do where they hold their paws to their mouths bashfully but still silent as fuck. i was so creeped out. my go to way of handling stress like that is laughing it off nervously. she got the hint and motioned she was going to get a shower. as soon as she was in the shower i decided i didnt want to be there when she got out, for now. but instead of lugging all my stuff i decided i would come back for it, preferably with friends. but i needed a key, so i went to her wallet she had taken out of one of her suit pockets, and tried to find the keys i had seen her slip in to her wallet. and of course as soon as i opened it i just had to see her id. i just had to, i was too curious not too. and when i opened it i looked at the id slot and i flipped. my. shit. whoever was in that id was not in any way who i was expecting to see on that picture. i didnt know the super personal details of my friend besides her name and age and general descriptive factors. mid 20s, white girl, etc. that was not who was on this id. it was a man, with long greasy hair, glasses, and stubble, in his mid 40 or early 50s id wager. i was so fucking shocked that i literally threw the wallet across the room after grabbing a key and ran the fuck out of that hotel room. i took fifteen flights of stairs down to the lobby and called up a friend who was coming to the con freaking out. i never saw the real person under the suit. my friend, a tall burly scary looking dude, went up for my stuff later that night with the key id grabbed. when he came back with all my things, he said there was no one in the room. i stayed with him in his room that weekend, and kept only to the convention my friend didnt have a badge to get in to unless i was with a group outside of it. the next night i deleted my furaffinity account, blocked my friend on my chat app, and deleted every connection i had to the furry world. the money be damned. i would never venture in to that mess again. to this day, that event still makes me sweat man. i have some really awful, funny, and silly con stories from my time as a traveling con artist, and this and one other incident top the list as the worst(tm). i have still not recovered. and that was how i almost became like the op in the image, but got out just in time (i hope) before anything terrible happened. tl;dr: i got catfished(??) by a furry and probably almost became a victim of some sort. all over furry art and my greed for that good good furry money. its not worth it. dont do it friends. i dont want to mention con names and stuff but if you googled furry and anime con happens at same hotel im sure you can find the magical con this happened at.

"this happened when dial up was at its prime. i was young, self destructive and couldn't care less. i just wanted to meet new people and have fun. i joined a chatroom and ended up finding someone who lived in my smallish town. we chatted for six months before agreeing to meet up. he was very aware that i was 14 at the time we started chatting, and i knew he was 30 something. at the time i thought he cared like a brother or a dad figure. i didn't know he was grooming me. it was just nice to be able to talk to someone who seemed like they cared about me. we decided to meet up for coffee for one day. we agreed to meet up at night a couple days days later. the whole time leading up to it he was saying he was nervous and scared. i couldn't figure out why he would be scared or nervous. he picks me up a block away from house. first red flag i actually noticed. i get into the car and realize he is one of my brothers high school teachers. i had met this guy before at a open house and he was really nice. so, i put the red flags on pause. we kind of laughed that we had met before and didn't realize it. as we are talking he passed by the coffee place. he says i have a better place in mind. he drove us 15 miles outside of town in a country like area and pulled over. this area of town was rarely ever populated by moving traffic. we were alone and there was no way out. at this point i knew what was going to happen. i thought to myself ""great, now i'm an after school special"". he said that my top was really sexy and started to touch my breast. he began to kiss me and held my hands down with force. you guys can imagine what happened after that. he was kind about it (as kind as this situation could be) until i got up the courage to say no. then he turned into a monster. i thought he would leave me for dead on the side of the road. after it was over a wave of remorse hit him. he apologized for getting so rough. he begged me not to ruin his life. i promised that i would never say a word to anyone and that i wanted it. he said he needed to hear me say i wanted it. it was pure survival mode at that point. i would have said anything to get out of there alive. once he felt reassured i wouldn't tell. he helped clean me up (i was a bloody mess) and dropped me off a block away from home. so, that's my horror story. don't trust people you meet off the internet."

"i met a guy through [match.com](https://match.com). after countless exchanges, we went on a date. he showed up handsome, well dressed and successful. we went to a beautiful french restaurant. during dinner he claimed to feel bad and asked if we could not talk then proceeded to ask for the check right after the entrees arrived. i asked for the waiter to box my meal. when we got into his car he said let's go my my house; have coffee and listen to music. i said, no thank you and please take me home. he drove in the opposite direction. after a five minute argument, we went to starbucks for coffee and he yelled at me because he couldn't smoke in the cafe. just then a friend texted and invited me to her party a few miles away. i figured this was my out, i asked him to go with me. we were there for about an hour and he said he was ready to leave.i told him i was staying. he said, ""you're not leaving with me?"" i told him no. he then slapped me across the face in a room full of my friends and no one saw it. i was shocked. he leaned in an inch from my face and said, ""what's wrong, cat got your tongue?"" he turned around and walked out. he then continued to leave me harassing messages calling me names and stalked me for the next three months. he'd show up at places he knew i would be. he would call me from other numbers and cry and ask me to go to counseling with him. he finally stopped. it ruined online dating for me forever."

"i was 17-18, dude (25 or so) was a friend i'd known though a group on yahoo chatrooms for probably 4 or 5 years by that point. he and his long-term on/off girlfriend had broken up around the same time i broke up with an online boyfriend for cheating on me, so we had been sharing our sorrows. totally platonic, nothing romantic was ever mentioned. he actually knew about my mom's mental health condition too and that i was uncomfortable around people with the same issue because she was super abusive to me and the mannerisms are a ptsd trigger for me (this is relevant). one day he says ""i'm coming up to [your city] for the weekend so we can hang out."" i felt pretty blindsided because he hadn't said anything ahead of time, let alone asked me about it, and had no reason to come to my state even, which was a good 2 day bus trip, but i was too polite to tell him no. i picked him up from the bus station and dropped him at his hotel and then had to go to work (thankfully). i knew from that car ride that i didn't want to be around him in person because it was pretty instantly clear to me he had the same mental health condition my mom had. that alone made me super uncomfortable, but we also had nothing to talk about in person, and it was pretty clear he had come up with romantic intentions. i saw him for about 2 hours the next day and then lied and said i had work again. he suggested i could stay the night in his hotel; i declined. he got back to the bus station on his own. after a week or so of silence, he actually apologized for his behavior (which i appreciated), but we never quite got back on the right foot. looking back, i know it could've been much worse, but at the time it felt terrifying and dangerous."
7733	20447	130	bqhfq9	eo5u5x8	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	when i was about 30 and living in nyc a girl on okcupid started messaging me. she said she was 21, a student at nyu, and was into anime and all sorts of other wonderful nerdiness (i should mention i am part asian so online dating would get all the weeaboos). but what was strange was her pictures. looked like a model. it seemed like there was no way this redheaded model contacted me out of the blue. we started texting. shed text me all the time. and started sending pictures. of her cat, her shoes, her fingernails. never a full shot of her. and then she started calling me. we would actuslly have great conversations and she seemed like some parts of her stories were true. she shared an apartment with other girls and she would interact with them (and i would hear them talk bsck) during our conversations. however the pictures of the redhead she sent me. in the photo properties were pictures several years old (so definitely not her). i even had a female friend point out her fingernails were rounded but the redheads were squared as evidence. anyway i pushed to meet her and she disappeared. the strangest part of the story was i would talk about this mystery, sometimes on other dates. and one of them had previously dated a writer (an asian guy) and shared with me a short story he wrote about his experience with the same girl. that a redhead contacted him, started texting, calling, etc then disappeared forever.
7734	20447	323	bqhfq9	eo5b0fu	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this was about 16 years ago. i (26f)was talking to a guy online and we were calling each other back and forth. he lived in nj and i lived in mass. we finally decided to meet so he drove up here from new jersey. my friend was working at a laundromat at the time so i decided it was safe place for us to meet there. after hours of waiting, he pulled into the parking lot in an old beat up car with all his belongings in the back seat and he looked about 50 years old. he was pretty scary and i was pretty freaked out. i guess he thought he was moving in which was no way happening as i had a roommate. what he told me on the phone he was a few years older than me and i never saw a picture. i guess i was very trusting because everything he told me, i believed. good thing i decided to meet him last minute in a public place. i had to tell him that i was not interested and he needed to leave that night. that was such a bad situation.
7735	20447	2688	bqhfq9	eo4ocuc	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	a couple of years ago this girl messaged me on reddit saying she really connected with a comment i made about first seeing the ocean because she had just gone through a similar experience. she was going to come down to chicago to visit a friend of hers and asked for suggestions of things to do. i gave her a bunch and then we kept talking and finding out we had more and more in common. we eventually started talking over the phone and text messages and when she came down we went out for burgers and beer. we kept talking every day after that and i was really starting to like her. she said she wanted to come down to chicago again and if she could stay with me. i told her of course and a few weeks later she was here for saturday and sunday. really it was mostly sunday because she got in late on saturday and fell asleep on my couch. the next day we went to the zoo and had a really amazing day. after that we came back to my place and decided to go to the brewery nearby which made a beer that had her name in it. we went there and then ended up barhopping through until we ended up near the dive bar by my apartment. we drank and played pool there and eventually grabbed some to-go beers and headed back. i asked if she wanted to see the place by the river i liked to go and drink and think. we sat and eventually started making out and decided to head back to my apartment. we hooked up and then the next day went to the south side to get breakfast at a place she really liked near her friend's apartment before she had to drive back. we kept talking after that and i was planning on coming up to visit her in detroit, but then one day she just ghosted me out of no where. not as horrible as some other stories, but it was really shitty for me because i actually really liked this girl and to this day i have no idea why she stopped talking to me. edit: she's definitely not dead, we followed each other on instagram and i saw that she was okay a bit after she ghosted me. edit 2: went digging and was actually able to find [the message thread](https://i.imgur.com/ipjp7xi.png) for those of you that don't believe me.

"in my early teens my friend and i had ""online girlfriends"" who we spoke to for about 6 months before finally deciding to meet up. we met at a theme park so it was all in public as we were worried it would turn out to be some weirdos or something. turns out they were exactly as their photos suggested and were genuine. the problem was that me and my friend, after saying hello, were too shy to say anything to them. we spent the rest of the day with them, queueing for rides together not saying a word. it was such an awkward experience. we kept in contact with them for a while afterwards but decided never to meet again."
7737	20447	307	bqhfq9	eo5knts	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	oh! okay, when i was 14, i applied for jobs around my local area online. most places didn't get back to me because i was a child. except for one man who ran a printing shop who wanted to talk to me on msn . i was eager for the job so i began chatting to him. he was late 50s and seemed friendly. after a week or so of talking, he wanted to interview me in person. i jumped at the chance. the day of the interview, i dressed painstakingly neat and smart . he led me around the back of the shop and upstairs to a small room. i already had major misgivings at this point but was too afraid to back out. he locked us both in that room together and turned a camera on to face me. i don't remember much of what was said, but he forced himself onto me and then came all over my smart clothes. i was in shock and really shut down, but i remember the bizarre thought of how he'd ruined my clothes. so yeah, there's a vile video of me out there as a teenager being abused by an old man and i never reported it because my mother beat the shit out of me for messing up my clothes.

"i met two livejournal friends, i'll call them adam and betty. adam came from the east coast, betty came from the west coast, they met in the middle and vacationed in my state so all of us could hang out. betty was fine. exactly the same irl as she was on livejournal. really pretty, too. adam, though. omfg. the first night we met up, we were going to karaoke. adam and betty would drive to my house, meet my mom, and pick twin and i up to go to the karaoke bar. betty doesn't drink, so she'd drive the rental car. they knocked. i opened the door. missy, my elderly terrier mutt who i love so much, immediately made friends with betty. betty walked all the way in, backing missy up, and then adam walked in. it was like a switch had flipped. miss dog *lost. her. shit.* she did the ""i am going to kill you"" bark--hackles raised, tail tucked between legs, snarling, snapping, and it sounded like she was screaming! mom asked me to help get the dog under control and in the back room, so i did. mom said she was worried about this guy adam, and wanted me to be careful. i said missy was obviously freaked out about him, too, so i wouldn't trust him as far as i could throw him. so, we went to the karaoke bar. betty ordered pop. this was a non-issue as she was a devout mormon and didn't drink. i ordered pop, and adam immediately started trying to talk me into alcohol because he knows i drink. hard nope, dude. being young and naive, i said ""maybe later"" rather than ""trying to pressure people to drink is a dick move and it makes people think you're a creep."" twin, who was still presenting female at the time, ordered pop. this surprised me, because he was going through a huge party phase; he spent most of his free time drunk. adam started trying to talk twin into alcohol, too. ""no, i have a headache, beer will make it worse."" we did karaoke, it was unremarkable, we went home. the next day, betty flew home. she just changed her ticket and bounced. she gave us the details in a filtered livejournal entry, saying that adam wouldn't stop hitting on her and she didn't feel comfortable being in the same hotel as him. we all blocked him."

"warning: long post. tldr at the bottom. &#x200b; i owned a minecraft server in middle school, and my friend and i were playing when we met this girl who was around our age. she and i became really close friends because we were both extremely suicidal at the time and both needed someone to emotionally depend on. &#x200b; fast forward until my junior year of high school. she and i had corresponded over the years, albeit not consistently, and she was still the only human i could talk to about my depression. we start talking again, and after a few days, she says she loves me. i explain that i really like her as a friend, but i'm not interested in an online relationship. in response, she threatens to kill herself if i don't love her, so i cave and tell her i love her. &#x200b; it escalated from there. she would ask me to send nudes or masturbate with her over skype, neither of which i was comfortable with at all, but when i would tell her ""no"", she would threaten to kill herself again, say i didn't care for her, act extremely hurt, etc. so, being young and stupid, i started doing the things she asked (with the promise that she doesn't save anything), and i started having panic attacks every day. &#x200b; she started demanding more and more of my time, and i basically disappeared from real life until the end of the school year. still, nobody knew what was going on - i kept it all a secret out of embarrassment. she tells me to visit her or she'll kill herself (keep in mind we live a 15-hour drive apart). so, i tell my parents i want to visit colleges in her region, and they let me drive out there on my own. i spent around a week with her, and i finally realized the difference between real love and pressure/fear/dependency. &#x200b; at last, i drive home from my journey, and she gets even more crazy, demanding that i come to visit her again and that i introduce her to my real-life friends. my panic attacks and suicidal thoughts got even worse, and i eventually found my neck at the end of a rope in my closet. it was only then i realized how toxic the relationship was, and i decided to cut it off rather than end my life. &#x200b; a whole bunch of stuff went down when i broke up with her. it turned out she was saving my nudes the entire time, and she would send them to my friends and try to break into my accounts using my nudes as a ransom. i lost a bunch of friends because of it. i started drinking to cope with the panic attacks the ordeal had left me with (in addition to preexisting stuff), but fortunately, my more supportive friends saw a problem found me a therapist i could go to without telling my parents. for the most part, things slowly got better after that, and i haven't heard from her since. &#x200b; tldr; &#x200b; met a girl online who pressured me to masturbate with her over skype and visit her 15 hours away which caused me to have daily panic attacks. she then sent my nudes to my friends and tried to break into my online accounts."

"i met someone on icq back around 2000. he was my ""online bf"" because that was a thing back then. there was a few times we wouldnt talk for a few years but everytime we started again it was like no time ever had gone by. back then he lived in canada, east coast, i live in the us, west coast. he slowly moved closer to the west coast as the years went by. back in 2015 or 2016 he was coming down into the states for work and decided to stop by so we could finally meet. we had dinner, it was weird but oddly familiar. pretty cool meeting someone you've been talking to for 15 years. later we go back to my place and hang out for a bit, decide to go out to the bar that i frequented at the time. i told him nothing too crazy because i had to wake up early the next morning, i can't remember now what it was, work or something else. but as soon as we got to the bar, he pounded 2 beers, cant remember the rest i started to distance myself throughout the night, and he kept disappearing outside throughout the night, but he ended up getting kicked out, i was super embarrassed because this was my bar, my friends, and he just totally disrespected everyone. we walk back to my place, i set him up on the couch and go to bed. it was summer so it was super hot and the only ac was in my room. i'd like to think the next part was due to it being so hot. he came into my room in the middle of the night and got into my bed naked. i slept out in the hot living room. few hours later i left to go do whatever it was i was doing, and i texted him that he needed to be out by the time i got back. i remember i stayed out a little longer because i didn't want to see him. he was gone by the time i got back, thank god. he kept texting me for about a week, asking what he did wrong and that he was sorry. i texted him once telling him he disrespected me and my home and my friends, and if he didn't remember that wasn't on me. i didn't want to talk to him. i haven't talked to him since. looking back on it he was a raging alcoholic. i would get late night voicemails from him while he was drunk. i remember one in particular, because he was walking home and fell or something and was yelling at cars i think. totally belligerent. it's kinda sad. i hope he got help. getting involved with an addict was something i never wanted and wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole, i immediately cut ties with a few addicts. except my current boyfriend, i never figured out why i gave him a chance, but i did. sorry for my random tangent. done "
7744	20447	44	bqhfq9	eo61uej	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i made friends with a guy on a tinychat server. let's call him dave. dave and i became good friends over the course of 6 months, so i offered to fly him out to my place and let him stay for a few days, get to know my roommate and myself. (i was an 18 year old girl, he was a 24 year old guy.) i pick dave up from the airport, and he just seems.off. i dont really know how to describe it. just off. something definitely weird about the dude. i just figure its nerves and brush it aside. we get to my place and he immediately starts trying to get me drunk. i may have been a stupid 18 year old kid, but i wasnt stupid enough to get wasted with some weird dude in my living room i barely know. i tell him i'm ready to go to bed. i go lay on one couch, let dave have the other. just as i'm starting to fall asleep, i hear dave quietly walking up behind me. dude literally sticks his hand down my pants and tries to touch and rub me. i was terrified so i pretended i was still asleep and pushed him away. eventually, he quit trying. i didnt sleep a wink that night. i took dave back to the airport the next day, he tried to kiss me. i acted like i didnt notice and got the fuck away from him as fast as possible. ended up having to change my number to get him to stop calling me. fuck you, dave.
7745	20447	90	bqhfq9	eo54ho7	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	to put it short, he visited me. we went out and got drunk. when i woke up he peed onto my couch while he was sleeping.
7746	20447	122	bqhfq9	eo5ozp7	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	no where near as bad as the others on this post but, we used to have this skype group for certain people that liked a certain show about colourful horses, so we could talk about the show and art and make friends in general. somehow managed to find people that actually lived pretty locally to me so we arranged a day that we would meet up (me and 2 guys well call them johnny and joseph) i was about 18 at the time so figured i would be fine going without one of my other girl friends to stick to me. the initial meet up was great we talked and walked and just sort of enjoyed the time. eventually johnny went home because it was already getting late. so joseph and i walk around some more just chatting normally. we are walking really far away, i dont know the area but apparently he does so we just go. soon i need to pee so i ask joseph if he knows somewhere i can go use the bathroom. he tells me his house is nearby so we can drop by there. im kind of getting desperate at this point so i agree. it takes about five minutes to walk to his place. its in a pretty dodgy area so im pretty spooked already at this point. i go to the bathroom and he tells me he will be in the room 2 doors down. so when i finish up in the bathroom i go to find him. its his bedroom and hes on the computer. do you want to watch me play tf2? he says to me. i say ok as long as its not too long because its getting dark outside. i watch him play and my anxiety is just through the roof. he then puts on some horror game knowing full well because we discussed it earlier that i am terrified of horror games. so not only am i anxious but i am scared shitless and on the verge of tears. i ask again a bit more sternly (im a shy coward so speaking up like this is really out of character for me) can i go home now? no joke now dude turns around and asks do you wanna make out? at this point i am completely speechless and am frozen in place. dude has condoms on the bed just ready like as if he was expecting me to say yes before i even came to the room. of course i just say uh no and walk my way out of that situation. im so glad it didnt go further than that because like it really could have been worse. the walk home was really scary too, it was dark and after that i decided i was never going to meet people without someone else there again.
7747	20447	157	bqhfq9	eo5kw4p	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not horror but as a 13/14 year old i used to meet boys off the internet all the time, alone, lying to my parents about where i was and going back to their houses. in retrospect im lucky i didnt get murdered and they were all who they said they were

"not really a horror story, but i met this guy online when i was 11. he lived in egypt, i'm in canada. we talked for 10 years and met when i was 21. he skyped me on my birthday to tell me he was coming to see me. it was surreal. we spent 12 days together and we had so much fun: drinking, dancing, exploring, getting to know each other. well when it was time to leave he was under the impression that i would eventually move to egypt to be with him. it was hard telling him that was not my intention at all, and we no longer talk except for the occasional ""how are you"" or ""i miss you""."

7750	20447	39	bqhfq9	eo6m8vp	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"do i, ever. buckle up y'all, it's a long one. when i was 11, there was a game website that had chatrooms. you could play games with other people and chat alongside the game, etc. there weren't a lot of younger kids on the site, and i never usually talked to anyone. until i saw one day this kid (we'll call him a) said he was 12, so i started talking to him because i had never seen another kid play on the website at that point. we ended up becoming friends and began talking on aol im. my mom was super skeptical of the whole thing so we asked him to write my name on a piece of paper and then take a picture with it. my mom seemed satisfied after that and never questioned it again. our friendship was only ever platonic. we stayed friends for about three years and kept connected through the game website and myspace. when facebook came around, i stopped using myspace and lost track of him after that. cut to a few years later and i'm now in college. i was in a three hour long class and decided to bring my laptop with me, which i never ever did. during our fifteen minute break, i decided to check my twitter account, which was inactive and i hadn't used in years. i saw that there was a message from a from like two weeks before and instantly messaged him back, not believing it was him. but it was and we reconnected. he was dating this girl from his hometown but wasn't happy. i was single and away at school, ten hours from home while my mother was dying from an unknown illness at the time. a was there for me at any hour of the day/night and comforted me when things were bleak and not looking good for my mom. we made plans for new year's (i live in new york and he lived in kentucky) to go see the ball drop in the city and finally meet for the first time, but i was broke and december was really rough for my mom, so i cancelled. i quit school to take care of my mom and because i was so busy with her, we didn't talk as much. i started dating this guy and stopped talking to a altogether. it didn't last long and a messaged me after i had changed my relationship status back to single on facebook. he told me he also had broken up with his girlfriend and from that point on, we were ""talking"". we would be on the phone for hours, texting all day and night. we would download movies on our laptops and press play at the same time so we could watch it ""together"". he would call up starbucks at the mall i worked in and buy me a drink over the phone, then tell me to go pick it up. he connected with my mom on facebook to wish her well in her illness. he was in my opinion perfect. and i was falling hard. this went on for months. the week before my 20th birthday, my best friend told me we were going out to dinner with her boyfriend and a few of his friends that she wanted to try to hook me up with. she knew about a but didn't know it was ""serious"". i wasn't really interested but she kept bugging me and bugging me so i relented. we go to dinner and a walks in with my best friends boyfriend instead of his friends. my heart dropped into my stomach and started doing the cha cha slide. he had contacted my best friend weeks before and wanted to surprise me for my birthday. he stayed for a whole week. we went to the local aquarium, the beach (he had never seen the ocean before), got slurpees (they don't have 7-elevens where he's from) and went to dave and buster's, went paintballing. it was amazing. we kissed the night before he left and i was heart broken he was leaving. he told me he would be back. the next day, he messaged my dad (whom i live with) and told him that he wanted to be with me and wanted to know if my dad could help him move to new york so that he could do that. my dad, impressed at the speech and how i was treated the week a was there, told him he could live with us rent free if he helped my dad with his business (i live on a poultry farm). it was labor intensive but a was extremely adamant about moving to ny to be with me. so he did. a month later, he drove his little car from kentucky to ny with his dog and all his belongings. the first night he was there, he had run out to his car to get something. our phones, both iphones, were next to each other and one of them beeped. thinking it was mine, i picked it up and saw there was a text from e. e was his exgirlfriend. the text said ""i miss my whalenugget"". i was super confused and slightly disgusted (whalenugget???) but he had just driven 9 hours, hundreds of miles with all of his belongings and his dog. i didn't sweat it and never mentioned it to him. the first two weeks were heaven. i lost my virginity to him. fell in love. finished the summer with a new job, and new confidence. he was working with my dad and that was going well. my mom was on the mend finally and things were just going really good. then he started getting phone calls from his mother saying how much she missed him, how could he leave her, why would he do this to her, etc. she would make passive aggressive facebook statuses, would message me and ask for him. it was overwhelming, especially only a few weeks into the relationship, and it was every single day. ""how could you leave me, my baby!"" gag. something changed about a month in. we had been having sex every single night and then it went to a few nights and then it stopped completely. we had been squeezing onto my twin mattress but suddenly he wanted the couch instead. he would blow my dad off to go fishing every single day, all day long. didn't want to hang out with my friends anymore. and was always always on his phone. this went on for another two weeks before he finally broke the news to me that his mother was falling into a deep depression and that he was going to have to move back home. i was devastated. he moved back home and the next day on facebook he was back in a relationship with e. which was funny because him and i had never broken up.we had kissed goodbye and had sex the night before even. i received a message from e on facebook that they had never broken up, hat it was just a ""break"" and that he needed to find himself, but he did and that's why he moved back home. i was furious that i had been used for the last two months. i was furious that he was an amazing liar. she sent me screenshots of conversations they had during the two months he lived with me. making fun of my weight during sex, how bored he was there and how he couldn't wait to go home. every single thing he had told me, was a fucking lie. i don't remember how it started but he started posting pictures that he took of me unknowingly on twitter. and these were really really unflattering pictures. one in particular that has stuck with me was a picture of me and his dog on my couch that he tweeted to national geographic and said ""look @natgeo, a whale is eating my dog!"" another one read ""we all have that one fat bitch we've slept with. guilty as charged."" for 10 months, this was every single day. back then, you could block someone on twitter but all blocking did was prevent the person from @ing you. i could still see all the tweets and morbid curiousity got me every single time. didn't matter how many times i reported him to twitter, they never took the tweets or his account down. pictures i hadn't known he had taken. he had gone through my diary and posted entries on his facebook that he and his friends and family commented and laughed at me on. eventually i stopped caring. i stopped looking at his social media accounts. i met someone else and eventually moved on. hindsight really is 20/20. i wish i could go back and slap myself for ignoring the whalenugget bullshit. i would have saved myself a lot of heartache."

"i matched with a girl on tinder and we agreed to meet up at a near by coffee shop. when i arrived i was sitting in the parking lot and noticed only 2 people in the coffee shop, some old guy and a girl who looked similar to the girl i matched with on tinder. she didn't entirely look like the girl i match with on tinder but she looked enough like her for me to pass it off as her using filters to make herself look better. i texted her that ""i'm here"", when i did that the old guy and the girl got their phones out at the same time and i got a text that said ""i'm inside"". i went inside and went up to the girl and said ""hey, melissa right"", she looked up from her phone frowned up and said ""umm.no.wrong person. right after she said that the old guy tapped me on the shoulder i turned he gave me a toothy smile and casually said ""howdy"". i ran out like i was running from a killer."

"i had a guy profess his love for me. over skype. he wanted to come see me. he lived in the uk. i live in the states. except i had a boyfriend at the time. i told him this. i told him that he was wasting his time and i have zero interest in him. he still is coming. i told him that there was no time to see him, as i had work and school. he says it's fine. he will wait until i have time to see him. i told him not to come, he says he has his parents blessings. so he came. he stayed in a hotel for 3 weeks while i had to deal with finals, work and spending time with my boyfriend. i hung out with him twice, once with a group of friends and once with my boyfriend. he got mad because he said that he wanted to hang out with me, alone (in his hotel room) and when i said no, he flipped. he said that because he flew over here, i should at least ""hang out"" with him. he flew back home to the uk a few days later and blocked me on all social media. tl:dr -dude travels from the uk to profess his love for me. is upset that i didn't change my mind. edit: ok, i'll include some back story. i knew him for about 3 years prior. he was a fairly popular streamer (at the time) and i was one of his viewers, eventually became a mod for him. we started talking on discord and then skype. i was 20 at the of this event. why did i even meet him? i knew him for a long time. i thought we were friends. i thought that he would come and realize i didn't have feelings for him if i said it to his face. i thought i could save the friendship. i never thought he would hurt me but even then, i was never alone with him. not even close. yes. this is my gw account. no, it was not something i did while i talked to him. no i never sent nudes nor did anything slightly inappropriate. me showing off my body now does not mean i don't know how to make good decisions. maybe not the decision you would have made, but still, you live and learn."
7753	20447	79	bqhfq9	eo5z632	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	horror story in the sense that i wish so much that i didn't finally meet him this way. my best friend of 14 years who i solely knew online passed away back in september. i found out the night after he passed when his mother messaged me and told me the news and passed along the info for his funeral. i live in california and he was in chicago and i felt that it was my duty to finally go out there and see him. it was completely surreal and horrifying to finally see him in person, in a box. that being said though, i'm so glad i flew out there for his service and had the honor of being one of his pallbearers. i just wish we had met up a long time ago before this.

7755	20447	40	bqhfq9	eo5q6xe	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i met someone from trollx and we decided to meet up since we were in the same city. went to a bar, went for a walk. it was a good hang out. i told him about my latest tinder date in which i drank too much. he goes on a passionate rant about how i need to be careful or i'll get raped. i'm like wtf. he backtracks saying years ago (before he transitioned to male) he got raped by a guy who he met on tinder or something. i'm like oh, ok, i'm sorry. i understand. however, he proceeded to antagonize every single man i mention in passing, up to and including my dad. i go to get on the bus and he shouts at me about being careful about rape. people turned around like wtf?! omg! yeah, we didn't hang out again.
7756	20447	96	bqhfq9	eo5pthh	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	so, i got catfished once. i was 15, used this app/virtual chat world called imvu on the pc. i was a pretty sheltered kid, still very hopeful and naive about the world, but i loved helping people. one day im on there and i meet this girl named morrow, she was the real gothic type and i was really into alternative girls. we started chatting every day, eventually i met her brother justin, and her close friend norma. we all chatted on this imvu website, sometimes played games on steam, hung out over skype. it was pretty great i even started dating morrow. so, after dating for about a year she hits me with some weird shit, about her being a vampire and how shes over 2000 years old. basically the vampire from those christopher pike novels. now to preface here, this was around the time twilight got big, vampires were all the rage, and i was super naive so i still believed that almost anything could be possible, maybe. so i tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, especially when her brother and friend are saying yeah she's totally a vampire and treated it as if it were some big family secret. (i know, fucking stupid in retrospect but i was young and really naive). fast forward a couple years i'm 17, still dating her and believing she is a vampire with this long history and a family. even believed that maybe i had talked to god about it because of another set of circumstances in which a random number texted me and i asked about these things, and the other textee, or texter?.anyway the person who texted me seemed to understand all of this stuff that i was hiding from basically everyone i knew, because i knew on some level that it all sounded crazy as fuck. the short of it was i was just willing to believe and i loved morrow. i was in my first year of college down in tn at this point, and i decided i was finally going to meet morrow in person. only one problem, she lived in mt, hence why i hadnt met her up to this point (although we had exchanged pictures throughout our relationship. i'd even gotten supposed pictures of all of her and said family together) so, i used my savings to move out to mt, but i was supposed to be moving with her 24 year old brother, justin. i wouldn't be able to see her for several more months due to her taking a long trip to india to visit her ancestral vampire roots. again, i know it sounds insane, but you see where this is going. eventually, we move in with other people, they help me to figure out that justin was the only one who ever existed. i was 18 at this point so i had spent 3 years believing in this whole interconnected network of at least 8 people by now, but it turns out old justin had been pulling the strings the whole time. just keeping up the charade, finding pictures online, oh and using all these different fakes to gang up against me when id start to question things. i began to put the pieces all together, so i kicked him out of my house, and thats when he decided to tell me he had fallen in love with me. such a piece of shit person who killed a part of me that i'll never get back. definitely dont catfish people, its a shitty thing to do
7757	20447	333	bqhfq9	eo541nu	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	met a girl online once. can't remember where but this was 15-20 years ago. we chatted for a while and seemed to hit it off. eventually she invited me to her house. turns out she was having a party with about 30 people. she pretty much ignored the whole time i was there. hung out with some cool people and played some mario kart. left when everyone else started to. never spoke to her again. i have a lot of online communities i'm involved in between some forums i'm active in and ffxi. i wasn't there for it but a bunch of my ffxi friends got together one weekend 10-15 years ago. one of them got drunk off his ass, trashed some stuff, and made everyone else miserable. he never got invited again. the most prominent one was where i got cockblocked by 9/11. i had a trip cross country lined up for a car show and meet up with a bunch of people from a forum i was on. i had been talking to a girl out there for months beforehand and it had gotten pretty hot and heavy. so i planned to go out for the show then hang out with her for a week or so after. i also had some work to do out there but it was mostly to hang out with her. 9/11 happened the tuesday before the trip. i ended up on one of the first flights out of town that thursday. 90% of the group canceled their trips though. when i landed she sent someone else to pick me up and she was nowhere to be found. i saw her at the show for about 5 minutes but besides that she ghosted me. i heard from her after a few days. her ex and her had gotten back together after 9/11 happened because life is short let's try it again etc. i spent most of the trip in my hotel room watching the first x-men movie on hbo. it was a surreal experience all around. they're not all horror stories though. through the same group i made friends with another girl out of state. we hung out a few times but figured out we click better as friends. i met her best friend on one of my trips and we started talking online constantly. she flew down one weekend to see how we'd get along in person. we've been married 14 years just about so i guess it worked out.
7758	20447	208	bqhfq9	eo61qfv	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not a horror story but i thought this thread could use some positivity! i met my best friend online, through a mutual friend whom i met on an mmo. she was from the philippines and i was from canada (we started talking right as i was immigrating from romania.) she added me on yahoo messenger 8 years ago and we talked or video called every single day since then. once smartphones became a thing, we would video call whenever our time zones matched up, or message each other on messenger. we were the same age and both were being bullied in school. she would stay up all night while i was hiding on breaks crying at school to video call me, then i would go home, take a nap, and then stay up all night on video call with her while she was at school dealing with her own bullies. it was the closest we could get to hanging out and hiding from our bullies together. she was the only person i opened up to about my darkest thoughts that i couldn't tell anyone else. she let me talk about things for hours and understood me on a level no one else ever did. she got me through the worst years of my life and is a big reason why i'm still here today. i noticed she loved doing her makeup since she was a preteen, and she was bullied a lot for it. i knew she couldn't afford nice makeup where she was, so i sent her a starter set of professional makeup because i genuinely thought she had talent. she is now the biggest and most in demand makeup artist in her region, recently started working for celebrities and major magazines. to this day she kept the first set of makeup brushes i sent her. we've been each other's person for almost a decade now, through thick and thin. since we're both 23/24 now and could afford it and also could make our own decisions, we finally met for the first time in hong kong over christmas. we stayed there for a month and literally had the time of our lives. didn't feel at all like we were meeting for the first time, it was like we'd always been neighbours and just grew up together. i was afraid that it might ruin our friendship, but i knew that we had to take that step to meet in person, since we were basically family. we've had our fair share of fights through the years, but ultimately, we loved each other enough to always talk things through for as long as it was necessary to sort things out. i genuinely believe we'll be friends for life. the internet is genuinely a wonder that we don't appreciate enough!

(keep in mind we only had text contact. never heard her voice). time went by (maybe few days) and she contacted our mother and said she was pregnant. turned out that guy had knocked her up, convinced her to run away, verbally abused her, and tried to keep her from having any contact from us by trying to keep her phone away from her. one day she was able to get in contact with our mother and tell her to pick her up."

7761	20447	361	bqhfq9	eo58ng3	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i was probably the 'horror' of the story. posted this before and, for what it's worth, i'm not proud of what i did. met a girl my age in a chatroom when i was 16. we'd talk every day and things got 'serious' in a puppy love kind of way. i'd only ever seen once picture of her, which was in black and white but when she floated the idea of me coming to spend the week with her whilst her parents were away, i booked a ticket and travelled several hours on the train to go see her. she was waiting for me when the taxi pulled up and my heart sank. she looked a lot heavier than her picture suggested and i wasn't attracted to her. at all. to top it off, the house i had to spend the next week smelled like dog. for some reason we put lethal weapon 4 on for us to watch and it was during the film that i decided i'd probably made a mistake and had to leave as soon as i could. the next day probably would have been too soon, so i decided in on the day after next. the part i'm least proud of is sneaking into her room before my taxi arrived and erasing my number in her phone. *then*, on realising that the majority of messages in her phone were from me and that she'd still have number, i snuck back into her room and deleted all those messages. the taxi came and i went home and never spoke nor heard from her again. not a nice thing to do at all. i'm sorry emily, you deserved so much better.

"started playing a mud in high school. basically a text-based adventure game, the game was based on the book franchise ""discworld"". i really enjoyed it, and so did a number of my mates. one of my friends actually introduced it to one of his friends, i'll call him john. &#x200b; john was very addicted and got a lot more immersed in the game than any of us ever could. and because of this he was basically 'powering' us through the game. through his travels, he met a girl on there that called herself katie. katie sent us pictures of herself, told us she was from new zealand. she slowly injected herself in to our msn groups and added us all one by one. we were all like 14-15+ at the time, so it was somewhat interesting having a girl in our calls who liked video games like us, until she started having private conversations with us separately. she never spoke on voice, as she didn't have a mic and was always very quick on text. mostly every conversation was a competitive ""1-up"" battle, where she'd talk about how great she was at seemingly everything. renown ballet dancer? check. beyond grade 8 in piano? check. knew 3 different languages? check. i had really really bad eyesight, she had worse. my friend beat halo on legendary, she did it before them. all the while being constantly online. we were a tight knit group and she was starting to divide us all so i think one by one we all got sick of her bullshit and dropped her completely. it's at this point that john kind of disappeared from our lives as well. &#x200b; i started playing wow when it came out and was heavily invested, and at some point a few years later after release. i got a message from a strange person on msn. i can't remember the exact reason but it was something to do with wow. turns out i hadn't blocked/deleted her and she was talking to me about the game. at the time, i was playing a very geared alt character and she would group with me for dungeons. she was very competitive, and i enjoyed talking to her but she was in to some really weird shit. would link me cartoon pictures of herself without limbs, claiming she had an amputation fetish. would ask me that if she wanted to die, would i be the one that did it. she'd link me pictures of her bruised feet from ballet, saying she wants to saw them off. she'd link me her prescription papers, complaining about her vision and claiming that she'd like to get an eye removed so someone could fuck her eye socket. things got darker and darker, until she had a meltdown. i don't really remember what triggered it, but it was heavily implied she was going to kill herself and then i heard nothing for a day. this girl lives on the other side of the world, and i had way more than enough information from her to contact her brother to make sure she was okay. so i did. 'katie' messages me back through google, and has no idea who i am. has never played an online game in her life. is in fact a ballet dancer and teaches piano. and is blind as a bat. turns out one of her male korean friends, from university that she had confided in about her own issues, was using all of this information to form a fake identity. the real katie got the police involved about identity theft and i don't know what happened to the guy. last i heard was he decided to get gender realignment surgery and is still pretending to be other people. &#x200b; the real katie and i became friends though and still talk here and there. (this isn't a plot twist, this one is legit real haha)"
7770	20447	24	bqhfq9	eo6oxfc	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	im not sure if this is the right kind of horror story, but it still bothers me many years later. way way back in the day, i met a guy through online role playing in aol chat rooms. it was never anything questionable, we just had characters and would play out scenarios together. eventually we really got to know each other and friendship became a long distance relationship. we would talk on the phone for hours and send each other packages. our parents spoke at one point, and after chatting for a couple of years, they helped set up for us to meet. everything went well. his dad brought him to my hometown and we actually got to meet. we saw each other a handful of times after that, too. he was my first relationship, and just generally a good friend during a lot of my middle school/high school formative years. eventually we broke up, but continued to be friends and keep in touch. i always thought i would see him again some day. when i was in my 20s, he had a death in the family and i remember talking to him. two or three months later i woke up from dreaming about him at like 4:30 in the morning. i couldnt sleep, so i went online to send him a message that i figured hed get whenever he was next on. so the horror story part, for me, was that i found out that he had been found dead in his apartment a few days before i went to send him that message. he had had a brain aneurism. it was absolutely crushing to know i hadnt made it a priority to see him again and that i would never talk to him again. it still really saddens me when i think about it now, several years later.
7771	20447	50	bqhfq9	eo5pdet	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i had this online friend back when i was a teen. we hit it off really well and would talk all the time. eventually we decided to meet up irl since we lived pretty close to each other. i had already had some instances where it turned out i was chatting with guys who were 30+ (i was very naive) so when my mom found out she insisted on driving me to our meeting spot and taking us home to hang out. it was a little awkward to sit in the living room with my mom in the room next door, but we made it work and we had fun. it was after that things went wrong. he started to become a little obsessive and stalking me. he'd sent me messages telling me what i was wearing at that moment and where i was. saying he'd kill himself if i stopped talking to him. things like that. it was terrifying, and i stupidly didn't tell my mom. i kept talking to him because i was scared he'd do something - either to himself or me. after some time i got a message from him saying he was joining the army and then i never heard from him again.
7772	20447	54	bqhfq9	eo5r9bf	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"we were friends of a friend in high school but hadn't seen each other in 15 years when she facebook friended me. after about three years of back and forth messaging, sending memes, etc she came to town and was really eager to meet up so i agreed to get coffee with her. i show up to the coffee place and she is half an hour late, and looks nothing like her pictures online anymore, i almost didn't recognize her. she sits down and monopolizes the conversation for an hour, we visit a local attraction where she gets in free with me and spends money in the gift shop, then says she'd really like to grab some food. we ride over to a restaurant and she orders a huge amount of food and eats it all. the check comes and the waitress asks if its together or separate and she immediately says together, smiling. i assume this means she is paying for me since i drove her to the restaurant and got her into the attraction for free. the waitress brings the check and puts it on the table, she leaves it untouched for like ten minutes. i finally am like hey do we need to split it? mind you i had gotten just some fries whereas she racked up like a $30 bill. she goes oh you have to get this one, i don't have any more money. i freak out because i don't have $30; i end up texting my husband asking him to transfer some money into my account from his. i try to leave and she starts crying that her brother kicked her out and her parents paid for a hotel for the rest of her stay but she has no money to get back because she spent it at the gift shop. mind you we are in our 30s. i reluctantly give her a ride back (about 10 miles out of my way) and drop her off with a ""bye"". she hits me with a barrage of fb messages how i am a horrible person for embarrassing her and should be ashamed of my behavior. i blocked and deleted her like a house on fire."

7776	20447	22	bqhfq9	eo5bosw	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not myself personally, but this happened within my friend group. we'd been playing a home brew rpg over a forum we all frequented for a long time. when skype and, later, discord came around we all joined up and became even closer. one day our dm tells the group that he and his girlfriend are being kicked out of the house he shared with his parents. told us they didn't approve of his relationship with her and gave him an ultimatum: break up or be booted out. so we talked about it as a group and eventually one of us decided he and his girlfriend could move in with him. dm and his girlfriend turned out to be a straight up roommates from hell. they refused to get a job so they could even *start* to make the most basic effort to pay for anything. they constantly whined about being hungry and pilfered my friend's food but they frequently let most of what they took go to waste. they absolutely destroyed the room they were staying in. they didn't have a vehicle so the friend had to drive them everywhere whenever they needed something. after about six months the friend couldn't take it anymore and kicked dm and his girlfriend out. but taking care of them destroyed his meager finances, his self confidence, and ultimately their friendship.
7777	20447	266	bqhfq9	eo521hw	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not my story but the one where a 14 year old boy posed as a 15 year old girl on tinder to bait a pedophile. when the pedophile showed up he kicked his ass while dressed up like spiderman.
7778	20447	43	bqhfq9	eo623dj	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	he was a semi famous computer programmer, well known, respected, glorified. he lived a frugal life and traveled around countries giving talks about free software and stuff. heard he was coming to my country to give some talks and they wanted people to host him, so i applied and got accepted as a host. the first red flag was the email with a list of 'requirements' - from temperature, humidity, pets, food, drinks (right down to brand names!) etc etc etc - you name it, it was in there. despite that all i moved kids into shared rooms so he could have his own room, set the ac on, and we were set. dude turned up with gf at the time, talked super loud really late at night, got up super early in the morning and loudly stomped about, showeed etc. farted, burped, ate his own snot, or body bits he picked off. he was constantly rude and obnoxious and knew everything, and would argue everything with no leeway or common ground. boy was i glad when he left. on the plus side - after he left the kids never once questioned when i said 'do this - its good manners' - they also requested that guy please never come back. &#x200b; (for the geeks - yes it was rms)
7779	20447	43	bqhfq9	eo66y3c	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i actually have three stories for you, because i'm a dumbass who doesn't learn his lesson. a little background first. i grew up in a cult, had an abusive uncle, and lived with my single mom who had bipolar/schizoaffective disorder. i was awkward as hell, had no social skills or self-confidence, and home life sucked. so let's get to the three. 1) i had been playing an online text-based game with a guy that lived two hours away. i thought he was the coolest guy, really nice. one night my mom bashed my head in with a lamp (she was the sweetest woman when she was well, but violence was common when off her meds)-- bleeding and desperate, i message him about what happened. he told me ""hey, i talked to my parents and we are coming to get you right now"". never met him before, they came and picked me up and i moved in with them. i had a trash bag full of some clothes and nothing else. i had just turned 16 a month before. the very first night i was there the mom got drunk, started ramming her mercedes into the dad's bmw (on purpose), and the son pulled a gun on mom to get her to stop. mom runs off into the night and moved in with her boyfriend (she'd been cheating - dad didn't know until that night). so all three of us are in a bad place. we played monopoly and ate junk food until like 3am. i got a job at walmart, started community college (i got my ged at 16), things seemed ok. the family very generously was letting me live at their place for free. the dad was pretty well off so he didn't bat an eye at taking me to dinner with his son and paying for it, etc. i'd never experienced anything like this in my life, we had always lived hand-to-mouth. about three months in dad gets arrested. apparently he was a prominent member of the ""republic of texas"" movement that wanted to cede from the union, and as a ""sovereign citizen"" hadn't paid his taxes in years. house and cars get seized for back taxes, son goes with his grandma, but i find myself with no place to live. i ended up moving back home. 2) two months after moving back home my mom tried to stab me in the chest with a knife - i caught her wrist in time so it barely broke skin. i decided it was time to leave again. i had been talking to a girl online for about six months. she lived near chicago, i lived in texas. we are both 16. so naturally i think ""i'll take a bus to chicago and get a job there"". because that's what rational teens do, right? i saved up for about a month from my crappy data entry job, didn't tell my mom i was leaving, and went straight to chicago (a small suburb, actually). i knock on the door of the address she gave me (she asked me to come, of course). nobody answers. i call a mutual friend that went to school with her from a pay phone (remember those?), and friend confesses that the girl had catfished me the whole time. she was using the friend's pictures (the girl i went to see was around 300 lbs, not the hot teen she was pretending to be), and both girls thought it was really funny - until i actually showed up. the girl i went to meet eventually did come out and apologized to me profusely, she had been catfishing almost a dozen guys because she was addicted to the attention. hot friend apologized too. i hopped on a bus and went back to texas feeling defeated. 3) home life still sucked. i started talking to another girl online (because i was too awkward for real relationships). she lived in canada. two weeks after my 18th birthday i flew up there thinking ""i'll get a job in canada, everything will be fine"". this was before 9/11 and you didn't need a visa. at airport security in canada i went through customs. apparently i knew nothing about immigration or the law. on the plus side, the girl got to visit me in the airport security holding area before the canadian officials put me on a plane (courtesy of the government since i bought a one-way ticket) back to texas. i was handcuffed on the plane and had a security guard sitting with me all the way back to texas, and told not to come back. it was an interesting experience. shortly after moving back in (for the third time), i had my head bashed in again and a friend from school and his family took me in. i moved to a big city when they moved, got a decent job, and now 16 years and lots of therapy later i can laugh about it all."
7780	20447	20	bqhfq9	eo60bqv	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	my neighbor had actually done this and it wound up coming to my house this was 2006 or so we(all the kids in the neighborhood) were all around the same age 14-17 and my neighbor had told the social circle that he had made an xbox buddy that didnt live far supposedly from our location and was going to invite him over so we could all meet this cool guy. but i didnt think he was serious bc he says lots of things that never come true or happen ever happened etc. and he exaggerates his stories. i forget about what he said, i think we all did, and it's like a month later in late november,its 20 degrees outside and we get a knock at our door at 11pm at night. it's some goth af kid asking if we knew so and so (our neighbor) he was like 15 and turns out our neighbor had completely ghosted him and went to the beach the weekend they were supposed to meet. his parents had to drive 2 hours to get here and had already left. he couldnt get cell service to call them, so he spent the night with us. my mom felt bad for him bc he seemed really shy and was probably embarrassed af. he turned out to be totally cool. really sweet, loved animals and video games ofc. his parents couldnt or wouldnt come to get him so my stepdad met them half way. well, he doesnt let that deter him and tried to meet up with my neighbor some time later. the same thing happens he comes knocking at my door late at night but hes crying, they had stolen his wallet and broke his cellphone and he was either high or drunk bc he was slurring his speech and unable to stand correctly. my mom calls the police the next day because she didnt even know he was there- i was naive and wasnt sure if he would get in trouble for being high or drunk and made a bed out for him in the living room. i didnt believe him at first about the wallet and phone but my sister said to let him in. cops got called the next day, was lots of stupid drama for that kid and neighbors. it wound up going to court. last i heard the kid went into the marines after hs, is married and is doing good.

7782	20447	112	bqhfq9	eo55j9a	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	so, not an actual horror story, as it ended well, but still gave me quite a turn. i'd been email buddies/pen pals with this girl since she was 15 and i was 19. when i was about 25, i was staying with my dad and stepmother and it was a really crappy living situation as my stepmom is a full blown entitled narcissist and my dad is an enabler. i basically paid them 150 bucks a month to live in a flea filled corner that was freezing in winter and boiling in summer. because of this and trying to avoid my stepmother, i'd wake up everyday and go to the library for as long as i could and work on my manuscripts and study. literally nothing but a blizzard or thunderstorm or the library being closed kept me home. i turned into a complete workaholic because i hated being in that house. so one day in at the library working away and i keep getting messages from my online friend asking what i was up to. i told her i was working. she kept asking if i wasn't at home. i told her twice nope. i couldn't figure out why she asked. it turned out she had secretly hopped on a plane and shown up at my parent's house. she was like hey i'm celestina's friend can i use your bathroom? which given what stuck up prigs they are is super hilarious to picture. it would be like if one of harry potter's wizard friends showed up at the dursley house. and in all the time i'd lived with them i never had friends, was always alone. bit of a nasty shock for them i imagine. but the girl was persistent and next thing i know she's got my dad escorting her through the library to meet me. lol. she's awesome like that. i did get in a lot of trouble as everybody assumed i'd planned her visit, despite the fact that i knew nothing about it, but otherwise it was great time. also i knew she was going to be loads of fun from the minute i stood up from the library desk and she gasped omygosh you are short! and i was all yeah i warned you. horror story for my folks at any rate.
7783	20447	327	bqhfq9	eo4utoh	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"okay, so i never really met them in person, but i'm so relieved i didn't. also this is a long story; tl;dr: i really dodged a bullet by not meeting up with these people because they got extremely creepy and expected me to be a.\*ahem\*.""cheerleader,"" despite being 14-15. so, when i was a freshman in high school, my parents finally got me my own computer. i downloaded gmod (cause, you know, that was the ""big thing"" at the time). there, i met my first (and last) online group. there were, like, twelve of us(?), and i was one of three girls. the ring-leader of sorts was this one guy who was a senior in high school. for this story, i'm gonna call him joe (not his real name). now, at the time, my parents were extremely overprotective of me online, as my mother saw the online world as an absolute evil and my dad just went along with what she said because he didn't know much about the platform. so, i wasn't allowed show my face, i couldn't use my real name, and if i played with multiple people, one of my parents had to be in the room so they could make sure i didn't accidentally let any personal information slip. no one in the group even knew how old i was; they assumed i was older because--at the time--i had a deep voice for a fourteen-year-old girl (they assumed i was in college because of this). well, fast forward about a month and the group went from using no cameras at all to always using face cams and even just calling on skype instead of gaming. for a while, they were okay with me not revealing my face, but they assumed i was just shy or self-conscious. it wasn't until then that i accidentally let slip that i was in high school (complaining about a teacher that hated me because i stood up for a girl with a ""fake"" learning disability), and then everyone wondered if it was a good idea to keep me there, as most of them were either seniors in high school or older. now, joe wasn't the oldest (he was a senior in high school himself), but he was the ring-leader, so it was up to him whether or not i stayed. he said it was fine, as he had been a part of this particular group since he was in middle school. now, i'm not exactly sure when this happened because i was kept out of the loop on a lot of things (i was told about this by joe's friend way after this happened), but joe and one of the girls (i'll call her belle) got into a huge argument. apparently belle had a huge crush on joe, but he wasn't interested, and this exploded into most of the group getting involved because belle was being immature about it and decided to vent to everyone. when belle found out that i knew she got rejected, she then started to vent to me about stuff she didn't like about joe (he's a slob, he shows too much favoritism, etc, etc). why? i don't know. maybe to save face or to make me hate him? i really don't know. i was a freshman, and i didn't understand relationship drama of any kind. about a week after i found out about everything, belle called me and told me to stop flirting with joe. now, here's the thing: i hadn't been flirting with anyone. everyone in the group knew that i was not interested in dating, that i was a bit young to date (again, i was a freshman), and they all knew that my parents heavily monitored my internet use (again, i couldn't even show my face). no matter what i told her though, she wouldn't listen. from here, things get a bit.weird. at a scarily fast speed. i didn't tell joe about belle's interrogation, but everyone found out. the group basically banned all girls except me (the other girl took belle's side and went on a similar tirade), and the guys assured me that nothing would be different now that girls were banned. boy was that a lie. suddenly, instead of girls joining the group to game, random girls would join the skype calls for like two gaming sessions, leave, then be replaced for another two gaming sessions. i also realized that these girls never actually played with us; they kinda just flirted with the guys and encouraged them while they played. i started to get weirded out by this (cause, you know, this was not what i had agreed to join when i first started playing). i slowly started to pull away from the group, and joe, noticed. so he asked me if i wanted to have a ""cheerleader"" for myself (joe was the second person i told i was bi). i not-so-politely declined, as i thought it was extremely disgusting. i reminded him that i was a minor, and he said that he knew girls my age that would love me. i, again, declined. he asked me to turn my webcam on (""come on, your parents won't know if you turn your camera on and then just open up the gaming window), but i refused, as i was scared of what would happen if my parents ever found out. which pissed him off. he then said that he didn't want me to play, but would love for me to be his ""cheerleader,"" which would require me to use my webcam. i declined and basically cursed him out as best i could (again, my parents were kinda within earshot). the other guys each asked me at some point or another to be their ""cheerleader,"" and one guy found out we live in the same state and asked if i wanted to hook up with him (he was 17 at the time). i was so disgusted by all this, so i left. this experience wasn't the only reason i haven't joined another gaming group, but it is definitely a major factor. i was told later by the third girl that had left with belle years later that it was best i left, because belle came back, and she and joe have apparently blocked everyone that was in that group and began to date about a year after i left.yeah. sorry it was so long. edit: so i don't know much of the details about the girls and the how and why they were there. this was years ago and i was kept out of the loop because i was the only girl. the best reason i can give for them being there is that none of the guys really had any girlfriends (probably because of their attitudes and behavior) and having girls around to boost their egos and flirt made them feel better? i don't know. i just know it happened."

7785	20447	17	bqhfq9	eo5wd9y	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i had gotten to know this one guy off an online game i played for a short period of time. he seemed nice enough at first but would always ask me for personal information (real name, age, where i lived). i never gave him the info but used fake ones. about half a year goes by and he slips up, calling me my real name, which i had never given him. he tried to play it off that i had told him it a while ago, but i knew that wasnt true and started ghosting him after all while. about 1/2 a year later he contacts me ago, demanding to know where ive been. i told him i had been busy to which he replied didnt know a play took up so much time. this was when facebook was just starting up and i didnt have one. i didnt post about my personal life on line beyond a privately set livejournal which wasnt under my name, and even those were random. this freak on a leash was stalking me for whatever reason. i promptly told him i didnt want to hear from him again and kept an eye open for a good while for anyone acting shifty as well as tell my parents about it. i never really found out who he was, but my dad did catch some shady looking guy creeping around our house and scared him off (hes a fairly big guy and when hes mad he can intimidate people easily, but my dads really a big old softly). either way, its been probably some 13 years ago sense than and thankfully ive not heard from the guy since.
7786	20447	35	bqhfq9	eo5rnep	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not a horror story, but still. i was on a trip to ireland and my friend got sick and went back to canada. i decided that i would spend the rest of my trip with an online friend who lived in germany. we got along awesome through email and chat, she edited my stories for me and we talked about travelling. we knew each other for probably two years. anyway, i fly over to germany and stay at her place. she was really busy and we didnt really hang out, but that was okay! i hung out with her mom and did some exploring by myself including a day trip to cologne and went for a weekend trip to paris. on the morning i was leaving, we were having breakfast and its when i realized (after about a week), that things werent okay. the plan was for me to catch a train to frankfurt and then get on my plane (she wasnt able to drive me, but i told her no worries, i could handle getting there). she looks at me and says it seems like youre expecting me to drive you to the airport. im like no, im good with taking trains. tbh, i love trains! and she was really stand offish. when i leave, she waves goodbye, says it was nice meeting me, etc. fly back to canada, everything is great. then one day my mom calls me into the living room (i was 19 at the time). apparently my friend sent my mom a message on fb saying that i was basically a horrible guest and was rude and that she didnt think i was ready to actually travel and maybe i should grow up some more. my mom couldnt believe it and i actually started to cry. i had made sure to be the best darn canadian i could be. i constantly was polite, said please and thank you. it was my first time solo travelling so i was a bit weary, but i didnt think it was bad. that fucked me up good. i was so uncomfortable that i still (four years later) dont want to go to my friends houses for more than a day because im terrified theyll think im a bad guest. it took three years before i would even travel again, something i absolutely love.
7787	20447	17	bqhfq9	eo6fyq4	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i played everquest when it came out all day every day, still being in high school at the time. my gf at the time and i played regularly together and we had made some friends in the game that we adventured with all the time. one particular 'friend', who we had been adventuring with for nearly 4 years, had just got stationed in az and came up with a great idea for us all to move out there together. we were a couple years post high school and were ready for a real life adventure so we jumped on the chance. about 3 months in to living together, with things seemingly going just fine, i came across some event logs on my gfs computer with old net send msgs when investigating why her pc was crashing. these were old command line msgs you could send between networked computers that was built in to windows. they were discussing taking me white water rafting and pushing me off and how far from civilization we would be and that i would probably die in the water or trying to get home.

"when i joined reddit about 7 years ago i saw someone mention my hometown in a comment thread. i messaged that person, and we began chatting. she seemed very cool and intelligent, and one day she invited me to stop by her family's yard sale. i was picturing someone my age (late 20s) who was living alone. instead, i stumbled upon a 13/14-year-old girl and her boyfriend. they were both so young and nerdy that i could barely communicate with them--they literally spoke in memes. it was like they'd never had friends before. and both of her parents were clearly raging drunks and high on painkillers, and they tried to hit me up for money. it was creepy as fuck. after i was there for about 15 minutes she looked at me and said, ""awkward penguin?"" and i responded, ""yup, awkward penguin."" then i got in my care and left forever."

"i want to say this was in 1997. aol chat. became friends with a girl from the same city (las vegas). we spoke on the phone for hours over a couple calls and decided to meet. she never showed up. we talk on the phone after and she tells me exactly what i was wearing and also described the friend i was with perfectly. told me she was standing right next to me but didn't have the courage to say hello. buttered me up with ""you're really really hot and i want you really really bad and i panicked."" i decided hey, it happens lets try this again. i take a different friend with me this time and we went to a spot on the strip in vegas. my friend and i were standing outside a mcds on the sidewalk and kept hearing a girl in a car driving by yelling ""woo hooo!!"" which was a catchphrase of sorts for her and i immediately recognized it. my best friend started talking sense into me and telling me i was a putz if i stayed any longer. we left. i wrote her a long email when i got home and basically told her i really appreciated being made a fool of and that we should probably just stop talking. a few days later i started finding notes on my car after work from her. i did unfortunately tell her where i worked during one of our talks. after that, i started finding notes left on my car when i'd visit a particular friend. then it started happening at my house. as this was happening i called her and wrote her many times telling her to stop. of course she never responded. wherever i went those days i was constantly looking around, taking note of anyone who i might have seen anywhere before. fast-forward a week and i'm at my friends house where i had found notes on my car. we're playing basketball and a car pulls up with a single woman inside. she says she's this girls mother and that she won't be bothering me anymore. she also said that she can see why she was obsessed with me as she looked me up and down. she was maybe 50, quite large, had really bad caked on makeup and a slight smell of sulfur masked by a strong perfume. i'll never know **for sure** if this woman was indeed her mother or was the stalker herself. shit scares me now that i'm older. i was just an idiot 18 year old and just shrugged my shoulders after that and moved on. nothing else ever came of it, but with the amount of knowledge about my everyday life this person had, i've always wondered if they randomly stalked me after that."
7790	20447	16	bqhfq9	eo65fku	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	am i the only person who doesn't have a horror story but actually has something that kind of saved my life? years ago, in the 90s, i met this awesome woman on a message board for a tv show i loved. she was so brilliant and i love brilliant. and an incredible writer -- just awesome all around. so i made plans to go see her. in another country. and i did. the border patrol or whatever it is in the airport asked me how i knew her and i froze. back then, early 2000s, people didn't really understand newsgroups, etc. i wondered how it would sound if i said i had only met her online. but the agent got distracted and i got waved in without having to say anything. we had a wonderful time. everything was great. a year or two later, she was coming to my city. i had just been diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal disease and had lost a lot of weight. a lot of weight. a lot. but i was avoiding the doctor and didn't want to take medication and was in total denial. anyway, my friend and i agreed to meet at her hotel room. i knocked on her door and when she opened it -- my god! her face when she saw me! it went from pleasure at seeing me to almost instantly absolute shock and concern at how much weight i had lost and how sick i looked. she didn't say anything. she was wonderful. we had a great time. but i couldn't forget her face and the day after she left, i went to the doctor and started the medication i had been avoiding. i'll always remember that moment -- it ripped me out of my denial so fast.
7791	20447	94	bqhfq9	eo5l6m4	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"this happened back in the dial-up bbs days in the early 90s. before netflix and chill, we had vhs and couch. the woman wasn't especially pretty, but was smart and rich (daughter of a doctor) and really liked me so i give it a go. our first date she wants to meet at her place and watch a movie. great, i figure i'm in like flynn! so i arrive at her address, and feel even luckier as it's a new neighborhood of mcmansions, years before that expression was even coined. walking inside, it's a semi open floor plan showcasing a professionally maintained *rainforest* in a 25x25 floor to ceiling glass on 4 sides area in the middle of everything, open to the sky and now perfectly lit at night. i make a good impression on her doctor dad with some smart banter, then we settle in for the movie. her girl game soon proved to be as awkward as her unkempt plain looks, as she started making over-the-top pdas with her dad sitting nearby, nose buried in some scholarly tome. i was trying to keep the escalation slow and discreet below couch level, and she kept putting both arms around me and leaning in too heavily, causing us to shift and move in the good doctor's periphery, even though he's apparently fine with it all. at one point, she gets on all fours, ass up and pointing in the general direction of her dad, and starts making out *with my ear.* mind you, we haven't actually kissed yet, but now she's breathing and slobbering loudly into my ear while her tongue explores it indiscriminately in a pattern like a norway rat trying to find the little platform in the dark experimental dunk tank. finally, she let out a low moan which was supposed to be sexy, but at that intimate distance of 0mm to my ear canal was more like a whale call fit to carry across countless nautical miles. then she plunged her tongue piston-like into my ear canal, simulating upon one eardrum a sudden dive to fathoms of depth and barometric pressure whales are accustomed to, causing me to jump up and yelp. i locked eyes with her very jewish father, while a long awkward moment passed while no explanation was asked or offered as to why the hitherto nice very blonde and white boy suddenly jumped up and shouted, ""**oye!**"" while in the process of making out with his daughter, whose ass is still up and pointing in his general direction. the moment passes; we get settled back into the movie, and at some point he bids us a friendly good night and pads silently into the dark catacombs of his suburban castle. next lull in the movie, i go in for a regular kiss, which she overeagerly reciprocates. she plunges her tongue into my mouth as deep as she can, then swishes it back and forth rhythmically, like a windshield wiper. i try to interact using my tongue, but hers just sweeps it aside like a bug, and continues the determined *swish-swosh-swish-swosh!* i break for air, then we kiss again, hoping it was a fluke. nope, she plunges the tongue straight in again, and starts sweeping back and forth mechanically. now we've gotten through the movie and she invites me to spend the night. she leads me to bed, strips down to a shirt and underwear, then says just a minute and goes into the bathroom across the hall. i'm lying there thinking it's weird but hey, easy pussy coming right up. a minute turns to ten, then twenty; during which my detective ears picked up the distinctive sounds of several sizes and hardnesses of pills rattling around different size bottles as they were upturned to disgorge their various rewards, and bouts of ugly crying. finally, she burst in, turned out the light, and climbed into bed with me and immediately started to try to make out. i paused the action and asked, are you okay? she said yes, but it was obvious she had been crying and might start again with every unsteady breath. she was obviously rapidly coming under the influence of whatever pills she popped, and the whole thing was now just a sea of red flags, so i pulled the ripcord and made apologies as i quickly dressed to go. she clung to me and pleaded, ""i don't want to lose you!"" as i thought, ""we just fucking met today!"" walked out of that palace of grave dysfunction, got in my inappropriately old and inexpensive car and drove out of the clutches of mcmansionville forever."
