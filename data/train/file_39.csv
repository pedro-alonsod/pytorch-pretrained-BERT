5527	31987	3048	bkxl3u	emkbzal	whats a skill that everyone should have?	time management **edit 1:** for few of those who want some tips about it. time management is basically prioritizing your work so that you can make most out of the fixed amount of time you have. here are few tips that i follow 1. every night create a list of work that needs to be done next day and order them in such a way that most important task are done first while maintaining a logical sequence of workflow. 2. at the end of the day check if you have done important things or not. 3. try to avoid procrastination, you have to do the work anyway. doing it in later point in time will only put you in stressful situation. 4. do some exercise or meditation, even simply walking can help a lot. 5. if you are unclear about what to do first today, just after waking up do the daily chores and take bath. it will really put you in a relaxed mood so you can think better. (it worked for me) 6. keep around 1 hour for yourself everyday to do things that you enjoy. after all we are humans not machines. **remember :** don't consider time as a resource which gets replenished after 24 hours, it is the only resource that you are dying for.

5529	31987	759	bkxl3u	emke4gt	whats a skill that everyone should have?	sewing. especially if you buy cheap clothes on the internet. just being able to re-attach buttons keeps you from throwing a shirt out when a few fall off. but i've even gone as far as to buy a sewing machine so i can tailor my own clothes to fit me, since slim fit shirts are hard to come by, and the ones i do find lack proper shoulder width. this has made owning clothing so much easier and less of a pain in the ass to try to buy.

"being charismatic, i read a pdf about the idea that ""being charismatic is something that people are just born with it, that you need to be handsome, wealthy, or intelligent in order to do it"", which is false and everyone can do it. and it covers types of charisma you can try, and explains that you don't need to change your personality, even you can be charismatic if you are an introvert. it can be useful in your job, and well, every time you talk to someone. edit: the pdf i was talking about is called ""the charisma myth"" by olivia fox cabane. also i fixed some typos."

5578	31987	20	bkxl3u	emkb183	whats a skill that everyone should have?	to be computer literate. i worked on an it helpdesk for a retailer and the amount of people who didn't have basic computer skills, despite working in an environment which uses computers to process orders, etc, it was painful to have to talk to people who didn't have the first fucking clue about computers. in this day and age, you would think turning it off and on again would be common sense. so many people still don't even consider doing this and some people i've spoken to didn't even know how to shut down their computer without the use of the os.
