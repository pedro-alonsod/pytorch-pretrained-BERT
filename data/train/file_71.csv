1543	49255	12022	bovsdb	enm6ume	what are some really really weird subreddits?	"/r/fedlegs it is a subreddit dedicated to the fetish (of one man? [/u/jimthefeeder](https://www.reddit.com/u/jimthefeeder)) of women with their legs painted yellow. not the torso, not the feet, just the legs, and specifically the color yellow. it is named fedlegs because the fictional process for getting their legs yellowed is known as ""feeding the legs"" all in all, a very benign fetish, but the lore of the creator is what i think makes this a real contender. below are the highlights from the [stickied post on the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/fedlegs/comments/8xzk6a/fedleg_explanation_updated_due_to_expanding/) detailing his creation, implementation, and outcome of the ""leg feeding procedure"", along with the dr. fedleg universe, which is a parallel universe to our own.  wondered if it was possible to create a fetish from scratch. based on what i've read it's a mix of: light bondage, leggings, orgasm denial, and ownership/marking in the vein of the scarlet letter (i assume that's a fetish, i don't know if there's an exact term for it.)  he has an detailed universe of how the system works. who/why people get ""fedlegged"". mostly based on the kind of clothing they wear. if they've got their legs visible to be seen, they're getting ""fedlegged"".  in universe, everyone is aware of doctor fedleg, (full name charles fed ostrog), the person who got the process of leg painting legalized; he has the government's support. he developed sustainable clean/renewable energy which is why he's successful.  he never wishes to see women injured/beat/hurt during the process.  ""his reasoning is a mystery, but the one thing for certain is that it has nothing to do with religion."" - actual line in the writing.  on the 2014 midterm elections, prosecution for dr. fedleg was added onto the ballot; people voted against prosecuting him due to his successful ocean clean up act.  dr. fedleg has various kinds of paints that last certain durations. he also has a blend of the paint that can stop excessively revealing women, slutty, or rude women from having orgasms. dr. fedleg is the only person with permission to apply this special paint. regardless, i find the whole thing fascinating. what led to creation of the character? why create this universe to have it all work? why does dr. fedleg care about the environment so much? is it to be relatable to other people that might stumble across this, or is it the author inserting his own beliefs into the lore? why did he choose the 2014 midterm election? the post was written in july of 2018, so the closest upcoming midterm election would have been 4 months away, but he instead chose to go back to 2014, which i think would indicate he's been thinking about this for a while. in general i just have a lot of questions."

1545	49255	5418	bovsdb	enm0ik5	what are some really really weird subreddits?	theres a subreddit out there that reads like a local community board, but its all just people pretending and its weirdly spooky. i stumbled upon it once, but does anybody have the actual name of it? edit: i knom i can't post the nawe, but can i say it wight be called r/havemewet?

"rarely look at porn on reddit, but i'm not going to pretend to be a nun. i did check out a couple nsfw subreddits at times. once i was strolling through a couple weird subreddits and saw a girl that was in a doggy style position showing her rear. it had a couple of comments and i remember thinking: *why would you comment on that?* i clicked out of curiosity and one comment was something along the lines of: ""guys over at (subreddit name) would love this picture!"" i forgot the name but it was literally about the anus not being directly above the lady parts. edit: if anyone knows it please reply"
