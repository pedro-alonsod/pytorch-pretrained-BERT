"actual physical checks and companies that demand them as payment it's a piece of paper! wouldn't you rather i send you an ach or wire payment? we're planning a wedding now and the amount of vendors who are like ""what, paypal deposit? ach? venmo? no! put a piece of paper in the snail mail to send to me so i can then take it to the bank and deposit it and hope it's good, then you're confirmed!"" is baffling edit: i am fully aware that wires and paypal both charge a fee for payment. vendors (especially wedding vendors) could say ""you could pay with a check or paypal/wire if you cover the amount for fees."" i would rather pay a little bit extra to not have to go to the bank and order checks then go to the post office to mail them. it's called a 'convenience fee' for a reason, and i will happily pay for the convenience of not having to mail a paper check. edit 2: check is the correct spelling in the us. no, it is not misspelled. no, i will not use ""cheque""."
