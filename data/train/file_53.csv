7532	20618	3492	bls9ab	emrqc6l	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	former boy scout here. i worked a summer camp in missouri one summer. one week we had a troop of mentally disabled guys stay at the camp. they were all older than standard boy scouts. one i took a liking to. big dude who you would be frightened to death to cross on a dark street. but he was mentally a 5-year old. he had zero confidence. i wanted to work on that. so i guide him all week but make sure he does as much on his own as humanly possible. we get to woodworking day and i help him construct as much as he feels he can. he just doesnt want to use the hammer to sink the nails. i do a few but notice every single thing he does, he does better than he feels and i decide im going to have him do it, whatever the cost. i give him the hammer. he declines. i tell him i believe in him. he declines. i say, tell you what. ill hold the nail for you, i trust you that much. i know you wont hurt me. he took the hammer. i hold the nail. i bit down hard expecting a broken finger. **whack** that nail went down like it was made of butter. he didnt even pinch my finger as the head of the nail went down. he hit it perfectly. he saw it and dropped the hammer and started wringing his hands and tried to be excited without making a scene. my heart was so full for him. i felt amazing for taking that risk. that was over 20 years ago, and ive never forgotten it. i now have two young daughters who i put my physical self on the line for regularly. sometimes it works out. sometimes i gain new scars. but i know being the someone who trusts you no matter what makes any physical pain not even a consideration.
7533	20618	2784	bls9ab	emr9e1w	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"a friend i went to high school with is an elementary school teacher at a school without a lot of money. she did one of those ""gofundme but for teachers"" things, i can't remember the site exactly or what the project was - something tech-related. she posted it on facebook and there was a decent amount of sharing and stuff, but outside of a few $25-50 donations there wasn't a lot of actual activity. a month or two goes by and i check up on it again, it's only like halfway to the goal with a few weeks to spare. i finished it out and paid for the rest of it, i wanna say it was $300 or something like that. never told anyone i know about it, left it anonymous on the donation too. this is actually the first time i've mentioned it to anyone at all. just felt good."
7534	20618	4905	bls9ab	emr64xm	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i (riding on my bike) saw a man lying on his back in the middle of an adjacent sidewalk. while it's fairly common around here to find homeless people passed out in doorways and whatnot, and therefore relatively easy to ignore, this guy was different. nicely dressed, clean, not obviously homeless, and really, really still. nobody was stopping. it was in broad daylight. i got off my bike and checked on him - his eyes were rolled back in his head, then would randomly roll around, his pulse was weak and slow, he was breathing, but very slowly and shallowly. once i stopped people started getting interested, but when i asked someone to call 911, everyone took off. i called them myself, and they wanted me to do cpr. i only had one functioning arm, so i again asked for help. all the rubberneckers again disappeared. fortunately an ambulance arrived quickly. i still don't know what happened to him, but i hope he was okay. i also called 911 for a guy that was obviously homeless, and drunk, at night in a mostly deserted area, because he was passed out face down on a sidewalk with a nearly empty bottle of bourbon in his hand, and a growing puddle of blood stemming from where he slammed his head when he fell down. i would rather risk some personal safety than wonder if another human bled out because i didn't want to be bothered. yes, i understand not stopping to help a guy in a van on the side of a deserted road in the middle of the night, or another dozen other scenarios. get somewhere safe and call the police! but i'm baffled as to how people can just flow around a person in need in broad daylight in a well-populated area.
7535	20618	11195	bls9ab	emr3efx	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	knew someone at school who was raised by a single parent, said parent develops cancer and my friend, who had been obviously depending on her, became utterly depressed. couldnt cook meals, finish schoolwork, do sport, most of his time was dedicated to his parent. i cooked/bought meals for him, helped him catch up all his missed classes, organised stuff to get him outside, etc. hes doing better now, so is his mum, although we dont talk anymore. still, felt worthwhile.

7537	20618	19467	bls9ab	emr5ujx	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i came home late on a delayed flight and there was an old woman sobbing at the bus depot because no one was there to take her home. this was in the middle of a bad snowstorm at 1 am so no one wanted to drive. i picked her up and drove out of my way to drop her off. had to drive an extra half hour in the worst conditions ever but it all worked out.

7539	20618	10309	bls9ab	emrg6f0	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i helped a waitress at a restaurant i frequent. after a few months of patronage i knew most of the staff and was on a first name basis with them. i learned that she was working 6 days per week, 8 to 10 hours per day, *and* going to school full time (5 days per week, 6 hours per day), *plus* she traveled by bus between 2 and 3 hours per day. a quick bit of mental math. on a bad day she could spend 19 hours with her obligations, not counting bathing, eating, or homework! and after she paid for her tuition, she only had 10% of her paycheck left over. as i have no family nor children of my own, i decided to pay for her university. she has since quit her job and is focusing on her studies. she regularly sends me updates about her classes and i'm happy to report she's getting straight 'a's as a psychology major.
7540	20618	14847	bls9ab	emr83ai	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i switched from one type of insulin to another. after switching, i had about 30 vials of novolog left over that i didn't need. we had a guy come out and do electrical work on our house and saw that he wore an insulin pump. i asked him what kind of insulin he used. he said novolog. i asked him if he wanted my leftover, non-expired, still sealed vials. he said sure. i imagine he was thinking that it was going to be only a few. i loaded them all up into a walmart bag and gave them to him. i don't know if he had to pay out of pocket or anything for his, but even if he did, the total cost to him for it could have well exceeded $1,500 in just co-pays alone. he was nearly in tears when i told him to keep it all.
7541	20618	4051	bls9ab	emr5otm	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"this happened about 10 years ago. i had an early childhood education class in college that involved observing/interacting with preschoolers. the college has a daycare for locals and teachers. one day we all decided to take the kids to a nearby park. this park was pretty secure but there was a very busy road right next to it, and there were gaps in the fences. one of the kids mom's decided to come early to pick up her son. she parked on the other side of the street and was waiting to cross. the kid saw her and basically immediately started running and climbed through the fence and was going into the street. i noticed and ran as fast as i have ever in my life, leapt over the fence (it was only about 3 feet) and grabbed the boy literally a split second before a huge flatbed truck zoomed passed going at least 65+ mph. i looked up and saw the mom and tears were pouring from her eyes and she was screaming, because from her perspective all she could see would definitely give the impression her son was hit. so she runs over and i just hand her the boy and she's in total panic and terror. the instructor gets over and tells me thank you and says ""we are never coming to this park ever again."" and she holds the mom as she's crying. i just stand there in shock. she took the kid home. we all walked the kids back to class. tldr: i saved a 3 year old boy's life."

7543	20618	4065	bls9ab	emr6x4d	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i don't know if it's the nicest thing, but a friend of mine was having a bad day so i surprised her with mozzarella sticks when i saw her that night. she cried.
7544	20618	9522	bls9ab	emr2ove	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"an acquaintance talked about suicidal thoughts over several weeks online. one day he said ""goodbye forever"" and left all groups. i found his address and sent an ambulance there. he's feeling better now, and thanked me a few days afterwards."
7545	20618	1549	bls9ab	emr4tfk	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was walking down the street yesterday and someone's garbage can got flipped over because it was windy so i picked it all up for them, there was quite a bit of trash laid out over their lawn and i assume they weren't home. it's probably not the nicest thing i've done, but it's the one that came to mind first due to its recency.
7546	20618	10123	bls9ab	emr01g7	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	once i found a girl curled into a ball in the subway stairs. she had been having coffee with her friend, and in the time she had reached the station she got a call that her friend had been hit by a car and died. she was in shock. i stayed with her for half an hour, simply being there so she wasn't alone, until she recovered enough to go on her way. we've never met again, of course. this is a huge city.
7547	20618	1406	bls9ab	emrbm2a	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	took the time to listen. there was this girl who was a grade below me. she didn't have a lot of friends. seemed to come from a strict family. we went to a small school so it's hard not to at least know a face. on a school trip we got to talking. her details are not important. i had been through some shit. small school. small community. my shit was known. i assume that's why she opened up to me. ran into her several years later. she said i saved her life with that conversation. she'd been thinking about suicide. now she was thriving in college. i haven't forgotten that lesson.
7548	20618	304	bls9ab	emrbx5q	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my wife and i paid for a little boys hospital and medical bills so his feet could be fixed, allowing him to walk and run with the other kids.
7549	20618	871	bls9ab	emridc3	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"i live in a city. so usually i just ignore all the beggers asking for money because it's so common and a majority are noticeably just feeding their addiction. but one day i decided to head to a popeye's for lunch. i saw a kid walking on the sidewalk on my way in, maybe 16 or 17. long, unkempt hair. shirt with holes. shoes with the soles that are coming detached or had no sole at all. and this was in the middle of summer where it's 90+ on a daily basis. and he had some really severe sunburn. this was a kid who looked like he was really in distress. i got in line and ordered food. decided to eat at the restaurant that day when i usually just get it to go. about 10 minutes later, the kid walked in and asked the lady at the register for a water. she was quite snobby and said no without second thought. so the kid's eyes filled up and he walked away without putting up a fight. he sat in booth and looked like he was just trying to get relief from the heat. i hung up my phone, walked over to him and gave him $10 and said ""head up to the counter and pick out anything on the menu."" he wiped his tears away, his eyes lit up in genuine disbelief. he kept asking if i was sure. i insisted. so he went up and just ordered the bare minimum, 1 piece of chicken, 1 side, and a water. he came back with roughly $5 in change and wanted to give it back. i insisted he kept it and invited him to sit down and have a meal with me. he was so polite and had a great heart. just one of them people you meet with a gentle soul. we had some small talk and the whole time he just kept thanking me for the food and for being generous. afterwards, i ordered him a small dessert and told him to keep the change from earlier. and got him a water to go. he thanked me, shook my hand, and i was on my way. i got back to my car and just broke down for a few minutes. i don't know what ever happened to him. i don't know where he ended up. i don't know if he was just taking advantage of me or not. i'll never know anything about his situation for sure. but it really opened my eyes to the desperate need that people are in. in our normal hustle and bustle of the day, there's people just literally struggling to survive. really just put my whole life and situation in perspective. i don't know if that kid remembers me or that encounter, but i'll remember him for the rest of my life."
7550	20618	2829	bls9ab	emrebfk	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my boyfriend never thought his birthdays were a special thing, for his birthday i contacted all of his friends (weeks in advance) and asked them to send a short video of them wishing him a happy birthday as some of them are abroad. i then made a compilation video of these as well as pictures of him growing up just to show him how special he is to everyone around him, especially me, and how much he has impacted my life and so many others in such a positive way. i showed him this after i took him on a limousine ride to the shard in london and gifted him a star in our names at the top of the building. he's done so much for me, i wanted his day to be just as special as he makes every day for me.
7551	20618	597	bls9ab	emrden9	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	once i was running at a cross-country competition, and i happened to fall into pace with a girl i'd never met before from another school. we chatted a bit, just the average stuff, and she seemed nice. i soon noticed that she was occasionally taking a puff from an inhaler. when we were about 2/3 of the way around the mile long track, she tried to take a puff, but it had run out. soon enough she was having a full on asthma attack, and i didn't really know what to do, but i knew it was quite serious. i told her she should stop, and go to the medical tent, but she refused to. i tried to persuade her, and she was obviously in a lot of pain. i even offered to giver her a piggyback, but she said we'd get disqualified. (which i didn't see as the biggest issue right then.) we were almost at the end by then, so i figured the kindest thing would just be to give up on getting in at a good place, and encourage her to the end as she wasn't giving up. i gave her my arm, and half carried her to the finish line. i let her finish the place before me, because she had worked a lot harder on that race than anyone else. i haven't seen her since, and i can't even remember her name, but i hope she's doing well.
7552	20618	2055	bls9ab	emr5ujb	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	befriended someone so they wouldn't commit suicide. a year later and we're still good friends
7553	20618	8689	bls9ab	emr4rz2	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	an old buddy of mine was having trouble with his graphic design homework and i was a year ahead of him in university. so he comes to me asking for help because he knows he isnt that good. i proceed to go to his room and sit there for a solid 6 hours helping him understand fundamentals, learn hotkeys, and answer any of his questions. the next day he says he is now passing and his teacher is proud of how much he has improved. he gives me a burrito and we call it even. edit: whoa gold?! thats my first one! thanks kind stranger!
7554	20618	6061	bls9ab	emrju2j	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i am a 9/11 survivor. i was in concourse when first plane hit. long story very short, i was carried out by a police officer and put in an ambulance. as ambulance was pulling away, the first tower goes down. the cops body was found 4 months later. his 2 kids went go to college on me. i did it anonymously. not all us wall st. guys are pricks, just most of them.
7555	20618	788	bls9ab	emr7z53	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i persuaded my boss to give my autistic colleague a raise because she deserved it and would never go to ask herself. edit: thanks for all the lovely reactions, silver and gold! i'll explain the situation a bit further since this got a lot of upvotes. i work for a company that sells steel parts and we had a client that required every purchase of a particular steel grade to be hardness tested in a very tedious and antiquated way. it was a repetitive job and the colleague i'm referring to was hired for it because of her autism. the company got subsidized to employ her and she liked the routine of the job. we work with a small team in the warehouse, which is in another city than the sales office (and manager/ceo) is located. it's a relatively small company and we don't have any scheduled hr talks or whatever. so if you don't make an appointment with the manager our wage or work is just never discussed. that's why i took the initiative to negotiate (without her knowing) to get her a pay raise. i had a very good relationship with her, we had become good friends. due to the pleasant atmosphere in our team she had also blossomed into a much more all-round worker than what she was initially hired for. she's just a smart and kind hearted woman with a lot of humor, but very unconfrontational and socially anxious due to her autism. bad experiences with people exploiting her in her previous jobs had made this worse throughout the years. in our team she was fully accepted. she worked hard and efficiently without ever complaining. so it was right for her to get a raise and she would have never gotten it spontaneously. i only did what i thought was right. when i told her she got a raise she was super happy, in tears. we are still friends and see each other, even though she is retired now. yesterday i had lunch at her house, which we do every couple of months. and she told me more than once how happy she is that the last job of her career was such a positive experience.
7556	20618	1207	bls9ab	emra621	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	bought a car for an employee. i(f/28) was the gm at a pub a few years ago. had an amazing waitress(f/24) single mother with one more on the way. she had no personal transportation in a city with notoriously bad public transit. still somehow made it to work each day, even if it meant walking her pregnant self 5 miles. she was always stressed about trying to provide for her kids, but was still professional and hard working. my tax return was pretty good that year, and a friend happened to be selling a reliable older car for a reasonable price. i moved not long after that, but she found me on social media years later to thank me, and explain that she was in a good place now and would like to repay me. i turned her down, seeing her success was 100% worth the cost of the car.
7557	20618	1411	bls9ab	emr2hc7	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this kid showed up to track everyday and ran in the february cold in a tshirt and shorts so i gave him a hoodie and still see him wearing it all the time
7558	20618	4948	bls9ab	emr4uuo	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this one sticks out. i was at a gas station roughly 11pm on a weeknight. the young girl in front of me has the counter filled with junk food and soda. basically the shit to keep you going on a long night. anyways her card was declined and she seemed very upset. keep in mind while upset she was never rude or anything. just annoyed. i walk to my car with my stuff after i paid while she sorted out her card issue. i then notice the only other car in the station is filled to the brim with clothes/belongings. it then clicks in my head this girl is down on luck. i walk back in the store and bump into her at the door. i tell her if she wants ill gladly buy all the things for her and anything else she needs. she gave me this odd look and agreed. im probably 24 years old at the time. after helping her carry the stuff to her car she looked at me with the saddest face and asked. why did you do that. i smiled at her and said. you were in the store buying all the foods i would be buying in a similar situation, so i figured you were normal. now if you were buying the bananas and old fruit i would have been more sceptical we had a short laugh about it and we went our separate ways. always wondered how things turned out for her.
7559	20618	249	bls9ab	emrbz90	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	helped them get a copy of their birth certificate, ss card, apply for college, and earn a full scholarship. i had a student a number of years ago who's mom died when she was little, and dad abandoned her and scooted over to europe. she was being raised by her sister, who was 2 years older than her. she didn't have any copies of any of her official documentation. i had her when she was 15, and we bonded well. i knew her situation and helped her and her sister out (rides to work, making sure there was protein and vegetables in the fridge, stuff like that.) eventually, college time rolls around, and she kinda nervously came to me and said she needed help getting her paperwork in order so she could take her driver's test and start applying to schools. let me tell you, it's a friggin' nightmare to try to get paperwork from nyc (she was born in a hospital there, but couldn't remember which one) without a parent in the picture. it took us the better part of 6 months to get it, which involved several failed attempts, a newspaper story, and the involvement of our congresswoman's office. eventually, though, from all the press, she got her paperwork and a woman's league adopted her and hooked her up with a scholarship. good stuff.
7560	20618	696	bls9ab	emr2ng3	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	bought some random person a train ticket when the train was about to leave in 2 mins and he didnt have enough change on him (he had a credit card, but the machine did not accept it).
7561	20618	2151	bls9ab	emr6lau	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i've bought groceries and school supplies for several families in the area that obviously needed the help, but didnt' have the ability to ask or were just unable to. one that sticks out in my head the most was a young woman who was trying to buy both during a tax holiday we have here in alabama. she was in front of me at walmart, and just flat out couldn't cover all that she needed, so she started putting stuff back. her daughter crying over crayons was what broke me. little girl wanted the big box, and her mom was putting it back. i said excuse me, walked passed her and put my card in the reader. no kid should ever have to cry over the big box of crayons.
7562	20618	1030	bls9ab	emr9e5r	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	after this girl in 3rd or 4th grade had bullied me for months i found her crying in the back of the bus. i asked her what was wrong and she denied telling me. i spoke to her friends and they said she wouldn't tell them eather so i went and managed to get her to tell me what was wrong. it turned out her father had been molesting her and he had just been sentenced to prison. i sat there the rest of the bus ride and talked to her about it and helped her calm down a bit. i know that must have extremely traumatic and i hope her life is better.
7563	20618	841	bls9ab	emr5kxk	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i talked to a friend who wanted to kill himself. his family was trash and didn't even try to prevent it. some of his other friends condoned it and one even tried to help. apparently, i was only person who told him that it was a mistake. eventurally, he got through his troubles, graduated college shortly after, and now lives with his amazing fiance. it can get better, folks. i can think of very few situations where suicide is the answer.
7564	20618	214	bls9ab	emr7rpt	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	calming down my best friend when they were doing bad in her pre-ap math class and i had a decent grade so i tutored her and she got to a 84 in that class it made me so happy knowing that i helped her
7565	20618	756	bls9ab	emr3yan	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	after spending much of my 20's asking my dad for financial help, i was finally able to return the favor. dad hit hard times and while i wasn't in great shape either, i paid his mortgage for the month. another time, i reconnected with my high school best friend, and he wasn't doing too well. divorce, lost his job. he didn't ask, but i sent him $100 as a gift to help him power through. maybe i got played, but he wasn't the type before so i doubt it. i don't have many friends, and the ones i do have tend to have the kind of problems i can't physically do anything about. but i help when i can. i don't believe in saying no when someone needs help i can afford to give. i'm no saint either, but at least i know i'm not a total dick.
7566	20618	187	bls9ab	emr8v8i	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was 13 i was going to have lunch at the school's bar and this 10yo kid shows up and is talking with his friend about not having money for lunch so i bought him lunch while i had a water bottle (with what i had left) 3 months later he finds me at school randomly around the place and thanks me. felt nice.
7567	20618	1280	bls9ab	emr4o1x	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i bought a single mom a bunch of stuff she couldnt afford to get her children off of her amazon wishlist anonymously for christmas.
7568	20618	683	bls9ab	emr8fwg	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	there was an elderly woman with downs syndrome in the same hospital room as my grandma after she fell and broke her pelvis bone. she couldnt speak english that well as she was very old and sick, but she kept complaining that her leg was hurting and would repeat that and then begin to whimper. it looked as if she was going to cry, so i went over to her and gave her a hug. a huge smile spread across her face, and then i drew her a picture of a dog. for a few moments she forgot about all of her pain and loneliness. brought my mom to tears. edit: a word
7569	20618	366	bls9ab	emrjp0u	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was in basic. we had cadetts from different countries training with us. one of them ended up being in the same room with me. we came along really well. the problem was, that they got paid almost nothing for their time here, our armed forces gave them some pocked money and their own nation didnt pay them for the training time in a foreign country. he had a gf and wanted to propose to her, but could not afford the flight home. i bought the ticket and gave it to him. he refused to accept it for quite a while, until eventually he took it. he proposed to her as he came home for 2 weeks and i am invited to their wedding. his whole family is insanely grateful for the act. we are true bros now after all the shit we went through in training. edit: thanks for the silver kind stranger <3
7570	20618	519	bls9ab	emrarew	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i got tipped $1400 as a delivery driver before, so shortly after i gave about $200 to this single mom i worked with and gave random $20s to charities around christmas. also left some $20 tips
7571	20618	485	bls9ab	emr655m	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i used to work in the visitors clubhouse for a single a baseball team. i'd also help do things on the home side, and during the game if i got what i needed to get done done, i could watch a few innings. all that is to say i didn't spend all my time in the visitor's locker room. after the game was over, one of the visiting players came up and told me he was missing money from his wallet, something like $150. there's very limited access to the clubhouse. besides me and like 1 or 2 other guys, it'd only be members of their team. i didn't want to think any of his teammates did it, and i didn't want to chance wrongly accusing any of my clubhouse coworkers. i ended up just giving him $150 of my own money (the job paid terribly but i got $45 a night for doing the laundry so i had cash on me). i wasn't living paycheck to paycheck or anything, but still. &#x200b; the front office ended up finding out about it, and i got a bunch of coupons for free stuff from businesses who sponsored the team which was nice.

"for my best friend's 30th birthday i wanted to give him something awesome because he's been amazing, supportive, and such a positive influence in my life. i wanted something meaningful to show just how much i appreciate him. he's really big into vinyl records, so i decided to have a record made of some of our recordings from when we were in a band together in high school. the front of the album was this really cool picture of our band's name i had painted on my parent's garage that we used as a band picture for this small street festival we played at. the back of the record was a black and white picture of the basement where we used to practice. i took that picture when our friend's parents (he was the drummer) sold the house and we were helping them move stuff out of it. the recordings i chose were from this practice session that i call ""good friday"" because we did it on a good friday we had off of school. it's not the greatest sounding recording we ever did (we used a boombox to record our stuff) but that day we ended writing and recording a song all three of us really liked within the span of like a couple of hours. we were never really great or played many shows, but the time we spent practicing and goofing off in that basement and going to the diner or the mexican restaurant for tacos afterward are some of the happiest memories i have from high school. [here's a picture from when i gave it to him.](https://i.imgur.com/lsvk8ci.jpg) i don't think i will ever be able to top that gift, but it meant so much to me to see how happy it made him."
7574	20618	896	bls9ab	emr76ye	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i met a girl on myspace (this was back in the day) when i was just randomly messaging people that looked interesting. over the course of three days realized she was very suicidal. she had a plan of when and how she would kill herself (that evening) and the method was lethal. i worked as a counselor at the time, so i knew this was incredibly serious. she had written me earlier in the day about her plan. when i saw the messages a few hours later and responded, she did not respond and i freaked out. all i knew was her name and the city she lived in, so i called the police there and they were able to track her through her ip address. while all of this was playing out, it was the longest two hours of my life. they got to her house in time and she was taken to a psychiatric hospital. the police called me to tell me that she was okay and later on her mom called me crying and thanking me. the girl called me after she got out of the hospital and thanked me. she asked me why i cared so much to go through all that to keep her from committing suicide and i was taken aback. i told her she was a person and even though i didn't know her very well, i certainly didn't want her to die and i cared about her. we've hung out a few times and we're still friends on social media. her life has had ups and downs, but man, i'm so glad she's alive to experience it all. i have no doubt she would be dead if i hadn't been randomly messaging people on myspace. for anyone that does not know regarding suicide: when the person has a timeline of when they want to do it, it's serious. when they have a plan of how they would do it and the plan is feasible, it's serious. when the method they are selecting is lethal, it's serious. they need professional help if they are at those points and having all three means they need intervention asap.

7576	20618	230	bls9ab	emrlilm	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"my daughter and i were at the mall when i saw a very young boy, think 18-24 months old, trailing behind a group of people. they seemed unaware of his presence but he was intensely focused on them and trying desperately to catch up with them. i found it unusual that they weren't turning to check on him at least. (i assumed one of them was his mom.) finally they pulled far enough ahead of him he recognized he wouldn't be able to catch up and he stopped walking and started crying. the ""mom"" in me kicked in. i held out my arms in the universal ""let me pick you up"" gesture and he immediately raised his arms to allow me pick him up. i did so and power walked as fast as i could to catch up with the group he was following. when i got them to stop i was shocked to find out he wasn't theirs! i'm thinking oh crap?!? who does this baby belong to?!? then a lady at the back of the group recognized him and said she knew his mom but she had no idea they were at the mall that day. we decided to take him back the direction i we all came from and hope for the best. about halfway back through the mall we see mall security with a frantic/distressed woman speaking rapidly in a foriegn language. her approximately 12 year old daughter looking pale and scared nearby. i knew immediately this was the boys mom. i walked up to her, she looked at me confused, then saw her son in my arms. i'll never forget the look of relief on her face as i handed him to her. she hugged him tightly, crying, kissing him, yelling at her daughter. my guess is big sister was supposed to be watching him and didn't pay close enough attention. i gave mom a hug. waived at security and left. hopefully big sister and mom pay closer attention in the future. that could have ended up way worse.

(edited to include that yes, i stopped my car in the middle of the street) this is about six steps below nice and falls under being a decent fucking human being. i was driving down a long-ish hill in an urban area a few years ago. no stop signs or signals. there was a crosswalk in the middle of the hill and as i approached, i saw a blind person with a white cane just standing there, i assume waiting to cross. cars were just blowing by. i slowed, stopped in front of the crosswalk (edit: in the middle of the damn street) put car in park/pulled emergency brake, got out, left my damn car door open, and walked over to the person and asked them if i could escort them across the street. and i did. i was so pissed at everyone who did nothing while that poor person stood there, just waiting for someone to be decent.

7580	20618	580	bls9ab	emr5ftl	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i try to do a lot of nice things when no one is looking, it helps me sleep at night. i held my landlord while she cried herself to sleep because her husband left her. i held my best friends brother as his grandmother took her last breath, rubbing his back and telling him she's in a better place now. bought several coworkers, friends and strangers groceries when they've been struggling paycheck to paycheck. someone did that for me once and it meant the world not needing to go hungry until payday. took three separate people into my home when they were struggling, mentally, emotionally or financially so they could get on their feet again. one divorce, one lost their job and one was getting clean of drugs. two of the three turned it around and are doing really well. i've given what i could spare, food or otherwise to homeless people but one in particular that stands out. turns out the guy ran out of gas and was stranded for the better part of a day, pretty much cried when i offered to buy him some gas. i was sitting in a road construction hault, literally in the middle of no where, four hours from any city and i saw an old man hitch hiking. for some reason i had this feeling that i needed to help him (i've never picked up a hitch hiker before). the man was fleeing a fire that destroyed his home, slept on the side of the road and had gone an entire day without water. he was in bad shape. he also grew weed to give to nuns and they turned it into cbd for cancer patients. i find that it's the little things we can do when someone is in need. but what i've done for people has been done for me ten times over by strangers. today you, tomorrow me.

7583	20618	237	bls9ab	emrcc4z	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"about more than 10-11 years ago back when i was a high school senior, i attended a birthday party of a friend of mine at her house. i remember feeling a *little* out of place there as the other teens there were the kind of edgy anime loving, linkin' park listening, [amv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anime_music_video) creating, [kingdom hearts parking lot-ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kifn5nvxu) teens (gamer nerd, wasn't too deep into anime culture then). but, i wasn't the real outcast there. there was a freshman girl there (henceforth she'll be referred to as *bree*) who wasn't well liked apparently. never met her before, but i noticed she was taking a hell of a verbal beating from other girls there for a while (not even sure who these bullies were or why were they invited). from what i've noticed bree seemed to have a kind of personality that would get annoying to others: little whiny, seemingly clumsy, easy to agitate, ""unattractive"" to shallow people. knowing how evil us young li'l shits can be you can easily guess a person like this will be bullied. half way through the day, bree couldn't take the bullying anymore and got into a shouting match with the other girls. this ended up with her storming to the back corner of the back yard, sitting on a swing-set crying. i typically really hate getting into the business of other people because i wasn't too socially confident then but at this point i kinda felt bad. i remember thinking to myself the idea of a party is to have fun and not be miserable so i decided to have a chat with her. sat down to the empty swing next to bree and asked her what's going on. (as linkin park is blasting in the background.) she told me these girls were always talking shit and bullying her for the way she was. told me about how she wanted to be left alone. i explained to bree about the personal bullying i've dealt with for a huge portion of my life at school since 5th grade. told her that i'm a huge black gaming nerd with a short-fuse and thin skin and how this is a terrible combination for bullies to exploit. told her about how fellow black classmates rejected me because i was considered to be ""too white"". told her about pointless fights i've gotten into. i told her it took me til i hit my sophomore year of high school to really understand things and realize what these bullies say to you doesn't matter a lick of shit. how they enjoy getting that rise out of you when you cry and scream back at them. i remember having a reasonably long discussion about how she'll get through this and come out a stronger person and how liberating it is to show off to these bullies how little of a flying fuck you give about what they say. how it feels goooood when you've gained immunity from their shit and watch them make fools of themselves. in the end, [~~it doesn't even matter~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evtxpuf4oz4) bree lightened up and thanked me for helping her feel better. she ended up clinging to me for the rest of that day but i didn't mind. i know how it feels to be alone. i do know the two bullies noticed what happened and made some dumb ""hiding behind your new boyfriend?1"" jokes though i think she took a little of what i said to heart and ignored it. .unfortunately after that party, i never saw her again. hope she's doing well out there. ^(and unfortunately to me, as i write this i realize this was probably the closest in my entire life i've ever been with another female.) tl;dr, fuck bullies, mang. this ended up being much longer than i wanted it to be, but i guess i felt the need to share as i never really talk about this to anyone."

7585	20618	82	bls9ab	emrby43	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when my father passed 20 years ago he left me a little money from a life insurance policy. my best friend at the time had three young children and although both her and her husband were working hard, they were struggling. she was waitressing at the time the hours her husband was off work and on weekends at several different restaurants. for christmas i sent her $1,000 cash and signed the note from an anonymous customer from the restaurant. she used the money to buy glasses for her and all three of her children, bills and food. i was there when the package got delivered by some random accident and totally played dumb. she sobbed. she was so grateful. she will never know it was me. i will never tell her. one of her other friends actually stepped forward and took credit for sending her the money and i still kept my mouth shut.

"i don't think it's the nicest thing i've ever done for someone, but their response was the nicest i've ever felt before. i met a girl at a wedding who had apparently been dumped that day by her boyfriend. i didn't know this at the time. i just thought she was beautiful, and when she started talking i wanted to hear more. so we talked through the night. then that weekend i caught up with her again and we went out for ice cream, and then we hooked up for a while, ended up cuddling on a couch deep into the morning. she got up to drive back to her house but before she did, she hugged me and said: ""thank you for helping me out of a dark place this week."" her voice was muffled in my shirt, but i remember how those words sounded, how her voice vibrated into my shirt, how she felt hugging me, and having that feeling is still a top 5 moment of my entire life. i fell in love with her, hard, but it turned out i was just a rebound for her. we have stayed friends and talk sometimes but. i wish every day that i could make her feel the way she made me feel that night."

7609	20618	41	bls9ab	emrbn41	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i don't know if it was the nicest thing but i felt really happy doing it. i was by myself on a 10 hour flight back home . when i got to my seat i realized that i was given the best seat in coach. you know that seat they sell or give to mothers with babies that doesnt have anyone in front of you. you can get up whenever you want and not worry about being squished by the person next to you. my dream seat. as the plane was about to take off an older woman was sitting with her adult daughter. the seat next to me was empty (i was extra happy about that). the daughter asked the flight attendant if her mother could move to the seat next to me because her legs were bothering her and she had poor circulation. the flight attendant said yes but that she had to wait until the plane was in the air and seat belt signs came off. when that time came, the woman attempted to get up to move but a young woman who appeared extremely nauseous or just sick beat her to the seat. when they told the flight attendant that that was supposed to be for her mom, they were told oh well she got there first. basically i just told them to take my seat. i sat with the daughter and the older lady was so happy. they were so happy and couldn't believe someone would give up their seat like that. there's no way i could have stayed in my seat and rested knowing that lady really needed it. made my day.
7610	20618	37	bls9ab	emru5jy	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	woman was caught stealing a little over $250 worth of merchandise by loss prevention at a local big box store a few weeks before christmas. she ended up having a pretty extensive history of theft unfortunately. she was crying and telling me about how her husband is a controlling drunk that doesnt give her access to their bank accounts. i looked at all the merchandise she attempted to steal. every single thing was essentials for her kids. snow pants, boots, gloves, and some toiletrys. after giving her the citation for theft(which i have no choice on because the store wished for her to prosecuted), i bought everything and then a toy for each of her kids. total was a little over $400. i then contacted and got her in touch with a victim advocate to try and get her into a better situation. ive bought stuff in the past for people down on their luck, but this was by far the most ive ever spent.

7612	20618	35	bls9ab	emrz70t	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my college used to be ten minutes walk from my home. i used to walk there daily and see an old homeless lady on the way. i used to give her some coins and a smile whenever i saw her. you may not believe in this, but whenever i used to see the lady, my day turned into a lucky day like a blessing. my end semester exams were approaching and i wish i could have taken her blessings for my exams. but she was nowhere to be seen. she represented an occurrence in my everyday routine that made me feel happy. however, as soon as my exam started, i saw her again everyday and fortunately my exams went well! finally, at the end of my exam days, i took her to a tea shop. the tea shop owner gave us tea in two cups. as soon as i gave the tea to the lady, the shopkeeper asked me not to give her the cup and that hell provide a plastic disposable glass for her. he started snatching the cup from the old lady. i didnt like that and i asked what happened. he wanted to explain but he didnt have any real reason to say. i realized he was biased towards her because of her appearance. i told him she is a human being like us and certainly can drink tea cup. you should have seen the smile on her face and others around us. what a lovely day. i hope she's okay.

7616	20618	31	bls9ab	emre7b9	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this probably isn't the nicest thing, but it's very memorable. i once had this old guy, he religiously used to walk to the pizza place near my house most nights, i'd be biking around and see him and just feel sad because of how lonely he was. as well, he also used to sit on a bench not too far from the shops (about a block away) and drink, which is where i saw him a lot too. one night i'm at the shop, he comes out with two bags full of stuff, i offer to carry them for him, and to my pleasant surprise he accepts. trailing my bike whilst carrying his bags, we engaged in a blunt conversation, he told me pieces of his life and how he was in a war (i can't remember what because my memory is awful). i walked him back to the bench, where we sat and talked some more. then i walked him back to his care home. i never saw him out much after this, and after a while i hadn't seen him for months. this was three years ago, he's most likely passed now, but it's still a pleasant memory.

7621	20618	30	bls9ab	emsenj1	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i accidentally bought two front row tickets to miley cyrus/hannah montana concert years ago for my brother and cousin, thinking they were $500+ together and 5th row-center. turns out i spent $1000 dollars and my parents had already bought them tickets. i started to try and get it refunded immediately, but then, for reasons i honestly cant explain because i was always rather selfish, i wanted to do something good. i called around to some of the local childrens hospitals and one had two terminally ill little girls who were obsessed about miley and this tour. we discussed how to go about donating so i gave them all the information to pass along to the parents. not long after, the hospital called and asked if i would be willing to meet with the parents because they wanted to meet me. i though sure, why not? i never anticipated how much that would change my life. i met both those girls and their parents. we smiled, laughed, and cried together. i later got a thank you letter from them with a picture of both the girls together which i still have today. it reminds me why i try to be a better person everyday.
7622	20618	61	bls9ab	emr9bag	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my mom's best friend since teenage years (i considered her an aunt) has always lived a financially struggling life, but she has been one of my best friends for as long as i can remember. about 2 years ago, she decided to go to a job somewhere out of state. i'm not fully aware of how the training was, but it was to become a truck driver for a company. anyways, i was making decent money as a server and was able to manage my bills while enjoying life at times. when she was in training, her food/clothes that was supposed to be sent to her were being delayed, so she had no money and nothing to eat. she started a gofundme for $500 to be able to survive the next couple weeks. when i noticed the gofundme on facebook, i saw she only raised $150, so i sent her the remaining $300. today, she is much happier and making good money driving trucks, and stops in town every so often to hang out with me.

7630	20618	28	bls9ab	emrxz51	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	eight or so years ago i was taking my dog for a walk on a sunday morning and passed an older woman - probably in her 80s - waiting for a city bus to go to church. when i passed back by her a half an hour later she was still waiting. what she did not know was that the bus service on that street had been canceled for that morning because of the big marathon that was running through our city. i let her know that and she started to walk home, defeated. i ran after her and offered to drive her to church. ended up jogging back home, getting my car, going back to pick her up and then driving her to her church about 7 miles away.
7631	20618	29	bls9ab	emrzi75	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i normally keep stuff like this to myself but yeah i've done my fair share of helping other people. the most recent one i had was around 3 weeks ago. end of the month so kinda running broke. happen to take the metro instead of public bus that day. i had around 300 rupees {5 usd roughly). a family approached me - a couple with 3 small kids. they were obviously in a very shitty condition, clothes torn, the typical below poverty line family. i was standing at the ticket counter and was alone at the time because i had just gotten back from my training. the mom was crying and seeing them in an instant told me that yeah they really needed help. so i buy the family all metro tickets to get to wherever they are going and gave them the rest of all the money i had for food. seeing the dad cry and tell me that this was the best thing someone has ever done for them, him pouring his eyes out telling me this gave me this unexplainable sense of satisfaction that i indeed just helped someone who so desperately wanted the support. i've been in situations in the past where things weren't going so smooth and putting myself in this family's shoes and feeling their struggles gave me the best sleep i've ever had in a while. hope that family is doing well.

7633	20618	25	bls9ab	ems4fl5	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i saw a young girl standing outside a gas station in heavy rain. i asked if she needed a ride (in the least creepy way possible) and found out she was supposed to be at a shelter for young girls but ran away with her friend who left her behind when she didn't want to go with these 2 much older men that offered to take them across state lines (human trafficking is a problem in this area too so extra bad sign). she didn't want to go back because she was on her last strike before she got juvenile detention. i asked her when she last ate and gave her a change of clothes out of my car. i bought her whatever she wanted from the gas station and made some calls while she ate. we talked about the shelter and how bad it was but going back, even back to detention, is way better than out on the streets. you could tell from the way she talked she had been through way more than a kid her age should go through. i still worry about her.

"i worked at grocery store a few years ago, and one day this mother and her daughter(about the same age as me) came in to get their grocery haul. we chatted as i scanned all their stuff, and they were honestly really great people. when it came up to get the total, she pulled out her ebt card to pay. now at that time, our system wasn't accepting ebt payment, so i explained that to the mother, and she suddenly looked very defeated, and borderline tearing up. i asked if there was another way they could pay, and she told me that they don't have any other money. i empathized with her very much, as i've been in that situation before with my own mother, not having any money to buy food and having to rely on food stamps. so i looked around to see if any of my coworkers were in earshot, and i looked back at her and said ""don't worry about it, you're good to go."" i remember the look in her eyes, those tears went from defeat to amazement, and she had the biggest smile on her face as i assured her i would take care of the total. she thanked me profusely, and she even asked me ""are you single? because my daughter is"" lol. no one from that job ever knew what i did, but honestly it was the best i've ever felt and i would absolutely do it again if i had to."

7651	20618	20	bls9ab	ems4xe5	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	late to the party, and i'm not sure this qualifies, but here goes: i saw a young girl sitting on a set of train tracks on my way to practice. there were a bunch of guys just standing around wondering what they should do. i told them to call the police and watch my gear, and ran over to her to talk. she was waiting for the train that was slowly approaching to run her over. at this point it was coming at a somewhat disconcerting speed, but i decided i would stay with her one way or another. i wasn't looking forward to the idea of having to fight this girl in order to get her off the tracks, but if it came to that, so be it.i was trained never to leave anyone behind. the engineer on the train was a bit of an ass and wouldnt stop despite the police and a union pacific employee ordering him to do so (he clearly refused over the radio, despite informing us he could with room to spare) i managed to get her to get off the tracks, and helped her to a waiting police car. after giving a statement, i grabbed my gear and headed to practice like any other day. i havent told anyone i know about this because i dont think its appropriate.
7652	20618	18	bls9ab	emsd52x	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	one day my car wouldnt start after loading it with groceries. figured i needed a jump as the battery was old so i called my wife and waited. while waiting, i noticed an older woman struggling with loading her groceries. so i helped her load up her groceries and went back to my car. figured id give the car another shot and it started right up. definitely had *car*ma on my side that day.

"i never really wanted to share, but no one knows me here so im not really taking credit. i bought a homeless man boots, i work at a shoe store and they came in and said ""i only have $40 and i need steel toed boots for my job, but this is the only donations i got"". i told him to keep his money and i bought him an $80 pair of boots. i didnt mind, something within me told me to. idk why i typed this, as no one will see it, but i never wanted to publicize that i did this anyway"
7654	20618	124	bls9ab	emr35hm	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	against better judgment, i allowed my brother to move into my new home with me and my wife in 2009 after he had just lost his job. unfortunately for me, he was a way worse drug addict and thief than i realized and it took a huge financial blow to me having to replace stuff i had before i realized. after that, i became more jaded and came up with a set of rules about who i will help and when. it made me far more resilient to trusting people, which has helped me avoid the pitfalls of common scams and schemes. it was a great learning experience.

"most recent at the very least. my grammy and i bought lunch for the guy at the table next to us. he was alone and it quickly became apparent he was deaf. he had his order written down on a piece of paper next to him and when he'd want to get their attention he'd grunt a little and wave his hand. one of the bus boys signed to him but i only saw him speak to the old man once. but it was when he asked for desert by pointing i got the urge to pay. he was smiling. he was so jovial and happy. the workers were so kind to him and understanding. the way he jumped up and down a little in his chair when they confirmed his desert made me happy. when i left i told the waitress that if he asked about it to tell him to ""just keep smiling."""
7656	20618	19	bls9ab	emrtvby	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i once gave away a car as a christmas present. it was my '83 mazda. had a friend that didn't have a car, needed one for school and work purposes and i was having a hard time selling it, and it was wasting away in the driveway, so i figured fuck it, you know. put it to some use.

7658	20618	17	bls9ab	emry2sw	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my sister (sorority/best friend, no blood relation) called me at 9 p.m. about a year ago, and told me she was being admitted to a mental health facility and she needed me to be there. it was the day before her birthday, and her parents were out of the country and her sibling was still underage/unavailable at the time. she'd been having problems with her so at the time, they'd been together for forever and had moved in together as the next step in their relationship and to say things weren't going well is a massive understatement. they were going through couples therapy to try and work things through, but it wasn't helping. she was having very bad episodes with her mental health and feared she was going to commit suicide. so i packed her favorite snacks, some clothes, and myself into my car and drove over. as it turns out the only other person willing to be there at the time to help her check in was her so, and it was not a good thing for him to be there. it was too toxic. so she and i sat in the intake room for over two hours together talking through the events leading to this point, just talking in general, getting her professor's names and contacting our campus to get her an advocate/dean who could help manage the situation, and once midnight hit, celebrating her birthday before she was admitted and taken to her room. since her family wasn't available i was named as an advocate/guardian/witness temporarily until her family could return and take over for her care (we were both over 18). she spent two weeks in the facility, and i visited as much was allowed, communicated to her advocate/dean as much as i could and helped rearrange the schedules so she could complete her work and semester. i helped keep her parents updated on her progress, and when she was eventually released, i helped her move out of her and so's place and back to her parent's house. unluckily for her trying to find the right prescriptions was a bit of a challenge in the following weeks as she had a few bad reactions and i had to rush her to urgent care/er more than once. even more unluckily, while in the facility her so had decided to cheat on her and then break up with her the day after she was cleared and released. it was a rough few weeks. she and i are only a year and a half apart in age and at the time i was graduating from undergrad, applying to grad school, managing an organization, dealing with my research projects, and just trying to keep my in head above water. but knowing she needed me, it was an easy choice to give her the support she needed over my own stuff. she's doing very well now, set to graduate soon, a wonderful new so who respects her and treats her well, her family and friends have rallied around her, she's my best friend and sister in every sense of the words. i'm very excited to watch her accept that diploma because she was so certain at one point that she'd never make it here. she's my hero and i'm so proud of her. edit: words.

7660	20618	36	bls9ab	emrauc6	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	had a man come up to me outside a local pizza place when i was 17. he looked ragged and totally emaciated. he asked if i had some spare cash so he could eat (pizza place was cheap and good). i said sure and handed him a $50 gift card my dad had gotten me for my birthday. at 17 that's all the money in the world. literally a month of pizza with friends. i got in my car and while waiting for a friend to show up, i could see an argument inside the store. there was a dispute between the guy and the girl behind the register. i went in and asked what the problem was. was the gift card empty? had i unintentionally been an asshole? no. the guy had tried to buy a ridiculous amount of beer. the pizza place didn't sell to him because he had no id on him (and was obviously a homeless trouble maker) and he got *angry*. he got kicked out. i told her i had given him the card (she saw the exchange happen) and asked for it back. i got him a large pizza and handed it to him outside when it was ready. went back to my car and watched him toss in in the dumpster without taking a bite.
7661	20618	36	bls9ab	emrqayv	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	probably saving a life. i was 20, at university, and had just finished my lecture and walked home when i decided i was going to food shopping since i had finished at 1pm. so i drive to the shop, park up and go in. the place was busy and i was walking up the first isle near the back when all of a sudden a woman started high pitch screaming & shouting in a different language. i turn to my right and she is pointing at a baby her husband is holding belly down. nobody moved. i ran over and you could tell the baby was choking. i basically slapped the baby's back and the piece of crisp came shooting out. the woman was so thankful, literally hugging me. i have super bad anxiety, so i literally was like its fine and basically ran out the shop, leaving my basket. they both came out as i got to my car door and was so thankful, the baby was fine, back to her happy self. afterward, i sat in my car for a good 20 minutes shaking, going through the whole scene in my head. i really started to worry if i had slapped the back of the baby too hard and ended up hurting her from dislodging the crisp. but thankfully, her dad had checked her over and she was fine.
7662	20618	16	bls9ab	emrvci2	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	there was a young couple- in maybe their late teens- with a small baby at the mall getting pictures with santa. it was clearly their little ones first santa picture. their stroller looked a bit tatty and the parents looked a bit worse for wear. i was standing nearby doing bell-ringing for charity when i overheard them discussing in line how they could only get the one picture. while they were getting the picture taken i paid for the biggest set of pictures the place provided and quietly went back to my post. i remember seeing the mom going through change in her purse when the photo person stopped her. i'm assuming telling them the pictures were paid for. the parents teared up. they came back to the booth 10 minutes later and took their big envelope of pictures with huge smiles on their faces. i hope everyone they know got a picture!
7663	20618	16	bls9ab	emrxpcn	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was at a gas station at around 7:30 at night. i was just coming home from work and i needed to fill my tank for the morning. i got out of my car, put my debit card info in, and start filling my tank. i then look to my right to see my ex girlfriend who was crying on the curb by the coffee shop. i havent spoke to her in years. i approached her and asked her what was the matter. she was surprised and excited to see me at the same time. she said she was on a date with the boy she was dating (who was known to be a jerk) she went inside to get something to drink while he was putting gas and he left without her. we both doubted it was unintentional so i helped her up and told her ill take her home. she lived 20 minutes away so it wasnt bad. when we got to her house she profusely thanked me and insisted we get back in touch, not as boyfriend and girlfriend but as good friends. i was more then fine with that.
7664	20618	17	bls9ab	emrylk3	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i found someone collapsed on the side of the road and called 911, administered cpr and also mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance got there. she had turned blue and wasnt breathing and had vomit and a swollen tongue obstructing her airway. i turned her on her side, scooped out the vomit, pried her teeth apart and started switching between cpr & mouth-to-mouth. at one point she bit my hand. eventually i her breathing again and the paramedics, administered a defibrillator, and took her to the hospital. her daughter, who was there when this all happened and was too hysterical to call an ambulance, got my number on the scene before they left for the hospital. i received a message two weeks later saying that her mum was recovering from a cardiac arrest and that she couldnt thank me enough for saving her life.

7666	20618	15	bls9ab	emrczt1	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	ever? i don't know about that, but a couple of years ago, i had an insanely delayed flight into columbus, oh -- weather was screwy, so my flight into dayton was cancelled (i had meetings in cin and dayton, but was going to spend the night in cincinnati). anyway, got into cmh around 1, managed to find a rental car, and saw this young couple trying to get \*themselves\* to dayton. i offered them a ride. now, it probably only added 45 minutes to an hour or so to my drive-time to go via dayton rather than direct to cin, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but the hour was pretty damned late. could have easily said no without much guilt, but did so anyway. fortunately, ohio has civilized alcohol laws so the hotel was able to sell me a couple of beers when i arrived at 3:30am.
7667	20618	14	bls9ab	emrwbmp	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my girlfriend in high school and i had a bad falling out. she was the one who officially ended it, while i was trying to work things out. after the break up, the first class we had the next day was with each other. i sat behind her, and one of her friends normally sat to the left of her. in my table group i had four or five of my really good friends. i was happy to joke around with them and take my mind off of her- who i still felt upset with and kinda humiliated by after the dump (it was my first time on the dumped end of things). anyway, my then exs friend who usually sat by her called in sick that day. after my third or fourth glance her way i noticed when that she had clearly been crying earlier in the day, and seeing her alone like that just sucked. i thought that would have made me happy, you know? in some sort of pay-back type of way. seeing the person who hurt you get whats coming to them, and all that. but seeing her like that just tore me apart. so i went to the back of the class and asked a mutual friend of ours to move up front and sit by her. i didnt say why, not many people knew we had broken up at that point. i hated myself about 2 minutes later when i had to hear her laugh and joke with my friend the rest of class, but it was definitely better than seeing her suffer alone. tldr; got dumped by my high school gf, saw her upset and alone the next day in class together, asked a mutual friend to sit by her and cheer her up even after getting dumped.

7671	20618	13	bls9ab	emrndlp	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was waiting for a cab to go home from work and that day was a pretty busy one. the cab rushed into the parking lot and picked me up. inside was an elderly lady waiting to go to the bank. by the time we pulled up to the bank, it was already closed (we were 3 minutes late) and the cab driver tried to tell her to call the dispatcher for another ride and she would have to wait a good 45 minutes. in the rain. i asked the cab driver to talk to the dispatcher about letting her just ride along until they have a chance to bring her home. they got all nasty and said she owed them $32 then for a round trip. she was worried because she didn't have the money since she didn't make it to the bank, so i paid for her ride. she was very kind and i felt that if i didn't get picked up, they could've made it. i know my little story isn't as heart warming as others. but i felt like this was just a nice story to share since a lot of people say my generation/age group are all shit heads.
7672	20618	15	bls9ab	emsckdq	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"this has actually happened twice in my life. the first time, i was on a flight around age 19, and the woman next to me started having a panic attack as we were taking off. i grabbed her hand and just started talking about cool things to do in florida (where the destination was) as she hyper-ventilated and started crying. i thought maybe i was making her uncomfortable or not helping, so i stopped talking and released my grip on her hand. she squeezed super hard and started tapping our hands on the armrest, so then i told some funny stories from high school. about twenty minutes later, she started to calm down. she told me she was so thankful for me being her 'flight buddy', and that she suffers from anxiety and it was the first time she had been in a plane, and that my rambling had distracted her enough to keep her focused on something because she usually ends up fainting multiple times during panic attacks. she had another one during descent but not nearly as bad. gave me a huge hug afterwards and called me an angel in disguise. second time happened earlier this year in february. similar story, woman sitting next to me got ultra scared but this time it was during some pretty intense turbulence. not a full-on panic attack, but she grabbed my hand and said ""i'm so sorry, i don't mean to be weird but i really don't like this (meaning the turbulence)."" i said no worries! gave her my earbud and we watched chopped together on my phone for the rest of the flight."
