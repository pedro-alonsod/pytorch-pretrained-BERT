7044	23473	10378	bu766u	ep8qtmh	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my 4th grade teacher had a reputation for making one boy in her class an unpopular scapegoat each year. lucky me. in previous years i'd been just another kid in the playground, but within two months the other kids wouldn't play with me during recess. one day i refused to go outside for recess. she asked why, and i foolishly told her that the other kids didn't like me. when they came back in, she marched me to the front of the class, and asked for a show of hands, who didn't like me. fourth grade kids (mostly) did what fourth grade kids do. i broke down that night and told my mom what had happened and what had been going on al along. she marched into school the next day, got a meeting that included the principal, and tore the teacher a new asshole. i was still stuck in that class, but the teacher moved on to a new victim. funny thing how self esteem influences academic performance. my school used to give us a stanford binet iq test every year. my score dropped ten points from third to fourth grade, then rose twenty points in fifth grade when i had a nurturing teacher. if you are still alive, fuck you, mrs. ericson.
7045	23473	9034	bu766u	ep8x43e	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	when i was in high school i got a lot of nose bleeds. like a lot. so i got one in the middle of class and i asked the teacher for a tissue, she said she didnt have any so i asked to goto the toilet to get one then she said no. soon i asked again when blood what dripping from my hands and she yelled at me for repeating myself which is apparently bad. soon a puddle of blood was on the table then i got sent to isolation for disrupting the class. i was then suspended for acting inappropriate during class. she was then fired for putting my life at risk. i gotta say when you get a nose bleed like that, you really see how much blood is inside of you. edit: thank you anonymous redditor for a reward! edit: for those saying im dramatic for saying putting my life at risk it was the school that said it, not me. i didnt consider it risking my life.
7046	23473	9090	bu766u	ep8k3yr	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i was bullied really bad. kids kept drawing awful ugly photos and leaving them on my desk with profanity towards my appearance. i had enough one day after dealing with a lot of abuse at home and the bullying at school and when i saw another broke down crying and brought it to my teacher. she just grabbed it looked and asked if i wanted it back. did nothing to help, wouldnt listen to me about the constant bullying and did absolutely nothing. i was in 7th grade and still remember it to this day. edit: thanks for silver friend. also thank to all who wished me well, unfortunately no i wont be doing anything towards the teacher, it was 12 years ago. i wish she learned better, but it was a small town school and as sad as it is, that's just the way it was. i hope i can be a better teacher when i'm finished school.
7047	23473	5560	bu766u	ep85qxk	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	mine is more of a light-hearted traumatic. in 4th grade i collected yu-gi-oh cards and i had gotten the (at the time) new three egyptian god cards. well i was caught playing with them during class and my teacher took them from me and threw them out. i was devastated after all the packs opened and cards traded to acquire them. i never forgave her. did they ever end up being worth anything before all the reprint boxes? i wouldve loved to see her face if she found out they were worth some coin. edit: the teacher was an older southern lady in her 60s so she was definitely in that mindset that she had 100% say in whatever she did with our personal belongings. pretty sure if corporal punishment was still allowed i wouldve gotten the paddle on several occasions. i wasnt the only one who lost cards that day. buddy who sat next to me had his black magician of black chaos and blue eyes ultimate taken from him.
7048	23473	5712	bu766u	ep80952	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	teacher told me i was a liar to the whole class as she didn't believe my grandmother was a world war ii evacuee. she refused to believe me as she assumed my mum was younger than she looked at the time, and therefore my grandmother was younger as well. she thought my mum was in her late 20s when in reality she was in her early 40s at the time.
7049	23473	4805	bu766u	ep8rcti	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i'm 65, and i still remember when i was 6 and the nun told me to wash my desk and then wring out the sponge, and when i squeezed it instead of twisting it, told the whole class that my mother was a bad mother because she had not taught me correctly. i knew if i protested that my mom was a good mom i would be punished. it still bothers me that i didn't stand up for her. why did that nun have to put me in that position? godammit.
7050	23473	2084	bu766u	ep8c06u	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"didn't traumatise me personally, but i had a first year lecturer in classics who went out of his way to terrorise the class. his first words to us were, ""i suspect as many as half of you cannot read."" he then administered a test, which two-thirds of the class failed. he was not shy about voicing his rather gleeful displeasure. (i did well enough to avoid his wrath, and, annoyingly, get singled out for praise.) he would routinely throw questions at students who weren't paying rigorous attention -- in a three-hour lecture on friday morning -- and then berate them for not knowing the answers. his comments on papers were beyond trenchant: ""are you illiterate?"" ""do you imagine this makes sense?"" ""this is childish."" etc. the unfortunate part is that he was a *superb* classicist. a close second was a novelist-turned-writing-prof who hurled a girl's manuscript out of his office door -- nearly hitting me in the hall -- as he shouted ""this. is. not. writing."" she came out to pick up her magnus opus moments later, weeping. great writer, self-confessed shit teacher."

7055	23473	27935	bu766u	ep8c3yy	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	technically it was the vice principal, but the day my brother died, apparently he thought it would be a good idea to walk in on story time (the teacher was reading to the class), set me on his lap and tell me in front of everyone that my brother committed suicide.

"we were discussing jean vanier and l'arche. for context, jean vanier decided to invite two intellectually disabled men to live with him and started setting up homes for them so they wouldn't be in asylums. the teacher looked right at me (i'm disabled) and said: ""oh yeah, vanier created those homes so you people wouldn't be bothering people because the handicapped don't function in society."" my friend i left just to talk it out. &#x200b; he got fired a few years later because he did not have his licence up to date. cherry on top: his wife was the vice principal."
7057	23473	876	bu766u	ep8f4dp	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i got into a shouting match with my band director before a marching band competition in another state. he had anger issues and the fight was over him calling me out in front of everyone for messing up my saxophone solo the week before. there was no one else around to see or hear the shouting. he never said so much as a word to me for the remainder of my time in high school and i was perfectly fine with it.

"the girls in our elementary school were given proto-sex ed before the boys. the basic puberty stuff, your body is starting to change, you might develop breasts, sweating, all that stuff. they made a huuuuuuuge stupid deal about keeping it quiet. it's the girls' little secret. don't go spreading it around school. (it only occurs to me now that that. is kinda dangerous in the wider scope of things.) anyway, my best friend was a boy and naturally, i skipped right off to tell him why suddenly half the class had an assembly all by themselves. my teacher heard about it, got me alone, grabbed me by both arms and shook me. ""keep your mouth. shut."" she was my favorite teacher up til then. totally a great thing to teach a kid."

7063	23473	19630	bu766u	ep87ury	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	so when i was in kindergarten i didnt make it to the bathroom in time and wet myself. went to the nurses office got new clothes but instead of panties i had to wear a pull up, not a big deal. i guess it was a school policy for kids my age i dont really know. when i get back to my class my teacher loudly says oh good the baby is finally back or something like that. she also knew about the policy and asked if i was wearing a diaper so every other student could hear. i was 5 and felt a ton of shame and humiliated. i started crying and trying to get out of school a lot because of it. my teacher often referred to me as a baby for the rest of the year. also she would constantly ask if i needed to potty or if i was wearing a diaper, like i was a toddler or something.
7064	23473	3771	bu766u	ep8k204	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"so back in 1st grade i was at this private school and despite not enjoying reading i actually loved school and had a ton of friends and it was great, got along with everyone. one day my sister stayed home sick and my parents dropped me off and as i was walking in i said hi to the nun that taught the other 1st grade class. she said hi and i kept walking. as i was approaching the end of the hall she dropped her keys, i heard so i turned around and looked, in between her and i were 2 4th grade boys i recognized from my sisters class. they started to approach her to pick up her keys when she lost it and started screaming at me, that i was rude and awful and some other terrible not so non like things. the boys were confused, i was confused, they were closer, and going to help but she was furious that i didnt help her. i got pulled out of class to talk to the principal that day, between her and the nun i really thought i did something horrible. i was punished and made to feel like i murdered this nun. when my dad picked me up that day i just started to sob, and i didnt stop until we got home and my mom and dad and sister held me. i was having a full blown panic attack, my moral values were being questioned and i was horrified at myself. my parents were furious and they called my teacher demanding to know what happened, all she said was she was unsure and that i seemed to have a run in with the nun. my parents went in the next morning for answers and we got an apology from the principal but not for the nun. and i remember standing at the counter with my big sister, terrified and sad and this nun walks in and says being rude to me again, my sister is standing there horrified, the front office secretary is shocked and my mom ripped this nun a new one. the nun hadnt seen my parents there. my parents went to the head father at this parish and read him the riot act, when he tried to defend the nun they went to our bishop, he clobbered the whole school. but by then the damage was done, i was a target to the nun, everything i did she had a problem with. i stopped being myself at school, i became very insecure and quiet. my sister and those boys took it upon themselves to check on me as often as possible, they became targets too. so at the end of the school year my parents pulled us and we went to a new school. i never got my confidence back. and in 6th grade a new boy joined our class, immediately i recognized him as being one of my best friends from 1st grade, he was in the nuns class. he immediately recognized me and his first words was ""damn sister thomas was a real bitch. huh?"" which for private school kids was a big deal to say. we ended up staying at the same school throughout high school and at graduation when our elementary school group got together for a picture he said ""you never really found yourself again after that. you should try to find it, you engage always been amazing you just gotta find it again"" so fuck you sister thomas you cunt."
7065	23473	8041	bu766u	ep8bxcn	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"in the 8th grade i had a book report to do for 4 books all due on the same day that was way too overwhelming to do at the time. i had some serious domestic violence going on at home between my parents. spent all my time taking care of my younger brother, cleaning up the house, cooking, and crying from all the stress. it was worth 20% of my grade and the day before it was due, i broke down and told my teacher everything; down to the time when my brother bled from his head from being hit by my dad, to the most recent attempted murder upon my mom. if i had even recieved a b, my dad would've beat the shit out of my mom for giving birth to a stupid kid. he called child services, my parents recieved the call, and gave me the silent treatment for 3 days. they told him i lied just to get out of the assignment. the social worker told my teacher what my parents said and made the rest of my year a living hell. he treated me with such pettiness after that and threatened to call my parents whenever i had either spoken too loud in class, or whenever i was unparticipative in gym. he called my parents for my ""bad behaviour"". home life got significantly harder after that, and my parents told my entire family continuously how stupid i was for telling him. they laughed at me when i cried or got upset about it. years later after repressing everything i was diagnosed with severe ptsd from childhood trauma as a witness and victim of domestic violence, attempted murder thrice, and it took me 3 years in therapy to get over it - it was quick, but it was tough as it was during my university years and i ended up having to take an extra year of school to catch up mentally. i was ready to speak up about my struggles again when i couldnt function anymore as the traumatic flashbacks occured twice a week for hours at a time. i couldn't do a single thing except tremble and live in fear. i was 18 by the time i was ready to reach out for help. fuck you mr. gentle, your name is creepy as fuck, and i really do wonder if being a petty 33 year old to a 12 year old child made your quality of life better. i hope that there's proper procedures put in place to protect children from such experiences. edit: i did not expect for this to blow up! thank you guys for all your kind words and support. it's so sad to read some of your replies. in a way, im glad to know im not alone, but at the same time, it breaks my heart to know that this isn't a rare experience. i'm actually from canada and i thought i would give an update! i'm now 23, finishing up one more course to get complete my bachelors in business marketing. unfortunately things did not get better with my parents. my mother is still with my dad, and after finding out i had a so, their treatment was beyond ruthless. after one more incident, i left for good and have not had any contact since this october last year. yes, it is still fresh and it wasn't my first time leaving but this is definitely the last time. i was supposed to graduate at 21 but ive finally accepted that that is okay. the hardest part, though, was accepting that my relationship between my parents will never be healthy and leaving was the only thing i could do to save myself. for all you teachers out there or for anyone working with adolescents, take the time to listen. even if it's trivial, silly, stupid - you have the power to change their direction in life and give them the motivation to make the best out of themselves. i don't resent mr. gentle anymore, and making that phone call was all that he could've done. just don't become a teacher if all you're going to do is undermine them. your job is to guide them. even if nothing could have been done by the authorities, he didn't need to hold whatever i said against me, truth or not. it doesn't matter. if you need someone to talk to dont hesitate send me a message! life is fucking bullshit but im not going down without a fight lol"

"my senior year of high school, my mental health took a steep dive. i was dealing with a lot of instability at home, one of my closest friends had become a relentless antagonistic bully to me, and the only thing that made me feel better was playing bass guitar in the jazz band class. or it was, until our band teacher left. the replacement - mrs. rath - was just terrible. i think she tried, but she was not good. my bully ran that class and rath encouraged it. my bass guitar skills ""weren't good enough"" so i ended up being banished to play triangle and jingle bells. it's a small miracle i didn't kill myself throughout that year, because lord knows i wanted to. i'll never forget the day she asked us our opinions on a specific piece we were playing (which was objectively horrible). she called on me and i said that i didn't like it. she then yelled at me for being negative and ""being the worst member of the band"" until i cried (fortunately, that was not long). she made me play songs faster and harder until i permanently scarred the tendons in both of my wrists, and whenever my bully decided to lash out at me, mrs. rath would watch and laugh. so yeah kathy, fuck you. i'm glad you got banished to elementary school teaching. i hope i never see you again. step on legos for the rest of your life. edit: i made this name up. i apologize, i didn't realize there was an actual kathy rath. please leave that individual alone, i don't know them"

7090	23473	116	bu766u	ep8qk42	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my family moved from the north to florida when i was going into the fifth grade. my teacher, for some reason, thought this shy, awkward, small town girl needed to be toughened up (basically hazed) by the class. i was so badly teased and isolated that ive blacked out my entire fifth grade from my memory. my mom, who actually worked at he school, said i came home crying every day. she was an underling and tried, but failed, to get me switched to another class. i ended up becoming tougher only after we moved away from that shit hole. parenting pro tip: the keys are not a good place to raise children ladies and gentlemen. oh, and fuck you mr. carlson. edit: a word

"in high school i was maybe 6ft in grade 11. i was a varsity wrestler. a kid who was in grade 10, 5ft maybe, was a massive bully to everyone and used his size as a defensive mechanism from retaliation. one day i was eating lunch at a picnic table alone and he came behind me and started choking me. i stood up, pulled him over my shoulders and set him on the ground gently knowing there was staff all around. the asst principal saw this and gave me a suspension for 3 days and tried convincing the parents of the bully to press charges on me for beating on the smaller kids. thankfully the dad knew his kid was a punk (i'm assuming) stood up for me with the ""boy's will be boy's"" line. i'm sure he knew the assistant was full of crap. traumatic in the sense i thought i would be punished for being a victim. my mom grounded me for a week. my dad brought me home my favorite burger joint dinner every night and said ""proud of you for not being violent to troubled people."
7092	23473	112	bu766u	ep8uhrf	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in grade one i had the worst teacher. theres a few times it was really bad. one time i went out for lunch with my grandparents who were in town visiting. after we ate, my grandma took me to a store. she bought me new coloured pencils ( i was obsessed with drawing and colouring). so she drops me off at school and i'm late. i'm not sure how long (i was 6/7) but all the kids in my class had gone to gym. i put my new pencils in my desk but quickly opened them to look before i left. my teacher came in the class and started yelling at me for being late. i didn't know and she didn't realize but my grandma had followed me and was actually in the hall listening. so my grandma comes in and starts getting mad at her. i cant remember what was said but it was upsetting and i was bawling by this point. my grandma told me to get my stuff and took me out of school for the rest of the day. that woman was horrible and should have never been allowed around young kids.

7100	23473	85	bu766u	ep8e4js	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in grade school my teacher had me and two other students stay back during recess so another teacher could come in, drag our desks into the hall, tip them over and rifle through everything. i was so confused as to why this was happening and why that teacher was so maniacal. in the end we got to put our desks back and my teacher told me that someone stole the other teachers candy bars earlier that morning and they thought it was us because she put her bag down in the hall next to us when we were waiting to go to our first class. low and behold that teacher found her candy bars and rewarded each of us with one candy bar. to write this and think back on it, its so weird and a bit scarring.

7103	23473	283	bu766u	ep86ifr	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a pre-k - 4th grade chorus teacher. lets call her mrs. c. (by the way, chorus in my school wasnt optional, you had to take it for those years.) she was honestly the most rude bossy person i had ever met, but the traumatic experience happened when i was in either 2nd or 3rd grade. it didnt exactly happen to me but the way she reacted terrified me. basically every year lower school all together do a performance together to honor people in the military/retired military. anyways we were in a rehearsal and we were standing on those bleachers. these were high bleachers. there was a kid on the top row who was fiddling around while we were practicing. there was a loose bar protecting the top row. he accidentally bumped into it, and the row fell. he fell off and hit his head, he started bleeding and everyone started screaming. we were evacuated into the mpr (multi purpose room,) where the teachers basically just brought them back to their class. mrs. c. was there and told us, it doesnt matter he hit his head. hes so dumb anyways. i. literally. barfed. theres no way she, a teacher who is supposed to be nice, just brushed this kids pain off, and it doesnt matter. i still the teacher in the hallways, and she gives me chills everyday. i also used to take piano lessons with her, but thats a story for another day.
7104	23473	276	bu766u	ep8igly	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	not exactly traumatic, but i honestly had urges to just get up and leave. the teacher was ridiculously hypocritical and obnoxious. every day when we came in she would criticize us about our life choices and then talk all about her life. then during exams (including the final we had), she cracked down on us talking, yet during the whole test she would spill her guts out. it wasnt even a small whisper like most teachers do while talking during a test, she was nearly yelling.
7105	23473	71	bu766u	ep8xj29	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i pissed my pants in 7th grade because i was so terrified to ask my science teacher to go to the restroom. luckily the bell rang shortly after and none of my fellow classmates knew. but i can remember later that year she brought up how she had made two kids piss their pants, as if she took pride in the fact that she terrified her students.

7116	23473	51	bu766u	ep906wy	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a professor for one of my theorized math courses that was a complete dick. there are three, specific experiences. background info: the class had no textbook, and we had only whatever he wrote on the board in lecture. even when it came to maple, which we were, apparently, required to know, even though in this course description it said intro to maple. 1. the homework was actually impossible, and we had quizzes on it, randomly. one time we had a pop quiz where the homework required for it was just undoable, because it was not related to lectures and not google-able. (senior-level, theorized, math courses) after the quiz, he asked, was there any questions on the homework/ quiz, so i raised my hand and asked, why do we have quizzes on things we dont cover, considering we dont have a textbook? (i was pretty mad at this point) his response was, i refuse to answer unless you rephrase the question to make it sound like it wasnt my fault, because its your fault for not understanding the material. i almost walked out of the classroom, but i knew that i couldnt ever miss anything, because he also didnt post his lecture notes anywhere. 2. one time, he told us of an upcoming quiz, and it was to basically figure out a proof about some theory that literally took 700 years for mathematicians to figure out; we had 4 days. i just didnt even show up to class. 3. this one irked me the most. i went to his office hours, and i apologized for making it seem like my question was his faultit was more of an actual question and not meant to have the intent of an attack on him; im a very blunt person. i asked if there was literally anywhere online or tutor wise in which i could get extra help. he told me that there was no textbook and that his lectures were all i needed. i was like ok, but clearly this stuff isnt working for me; you dont have any back-up plans for students that cant understand easily? (keep in mind, again, his lectures had almost nothing to do with the homework assignments, which stopped about halfway through the semester, so there was actually no way in teaching yourself this stuff.) he told me that he would not help me and to just study his lectures harder, so i left. overall, one of the worst professors, and humans, i have ever met. i can not believe someone of that manner and caliber was allowed to be a professor and was actual credible. i somehow got a c, and i surely dont know how anyone got an a. the classs grades were like 35% a, literally 1 b, 50% c, and the rest were below c.

7120	23473	87	bu766u	ep8ebi4	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	not particularly traumatic (the first one, anyway), but i have two stories i'd like to share: the first is of a teacher in my secondary school who screwed over a lot of students' it gcses. she wasn't the worst teacher, she was actually very likeable. she, however, decided that instead of teaching the unit like she was supposed to, she'd just do the work at the front of the class and have all of us copy as she went. obviously this meant that everyone's work looked near identical to each other's. needless to say, her superiors found out and she was fired. oh, she also allegedly slept with a student at a prom a few years prior. the second story is a tad more personal, i'll keep it brief. i ended up having a thing for one of the teachers in my second year of college (i know, thin ice). i had a very positive relationship with her and even liked her enough to consider her a close friend, and i feel as though she held a similar sentiment toward me. i was never able to express myself properly when face to face with her (one time i tried to thank her for being so supportive and friendly to me and i accidentally thanked her for being 'pretty cool' instead, which she teased me for). so, near the end of the year she tells me of her plans to leave the country. she's going to sri lanka to teach kids english (it's all very noble). i learned of these plans in 2018, come easter 2019 and, well, we all know what happened in that country. i have never feared for someone's life before and, bearing in mind i hadn't (and still don't have) a way to contact her i was scared shitless of the possibility of something happening. thankfully i have no reason to believe anything bad happened to her due to monitoring the number of posts on one of her social accounts (a little stalkerish but i needed to know), but that shit fucks with you, especially when you don't expect it. edit: just added a sentence in parentheses
7121	23473	39	bu766u	ep8kf3x	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in our school the football coach wanted me to play on the team, so in order to get me to play, he publicly embarrassed me for an entire class period, saying such things that i was a coward and had a yellow streak down my back. his angry ranting went on for an hour with the class sitting in stunned silence. he also stood in the doorway to prevent me from leaving the room. after that experience i had great difficulty with public speaking for years. i learned for the first time that monsters can be real. thankfully, he is now deceased from natural causes.
7122	23473	44	bu766u	ep8r3qj	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a math teacher who was also the track coach. one day during practice she was assigning people to events during an upcoming track meet. kids were saying what event they wanted to participate in and shed write their name/event on an index card then put it in her folder. well she left her folder open and you could clearly see that on the back of each index card shed written either fast or slow. a lot of kids were upset to see that they were considered slow and a bunch left the team after that because they felt bad about their efforts. the worst part is this was middle school and the stakes clearly werent that high, so she essential ruined it for us for no reason.

7125	23473	103	bu766u	ep8y6fz	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	when i was 14 years old i was accepted into an arts magnet school. it was a pretty big deal in the city that i grew up in. prestigious artists came in to teach young students that displayed promise, i guess. i was accepted into a creative writing department, one of only four freshmen to be accepted. it was the biggest deal of my life. within a few weeks this semi-famous and important 55 year old man began molesting me. in front of his classroom. in front of everyone. he didn't even bother trying to hide it. i was young and stupid and for awhile i thought that the attention meant i was special, and when i quickly realized how awful it was i felt like i couldn't do anything because everyone saw it and no one was stopping it. he made me believe, as a freshman, a 14 year old child, that men sexually touching a young girl in front of her peers was totally normal. so i stayed quiet for four months. my fingernails fell out. i began having intense panic attacks. i finally spoke out and he lost his job and the school attorneys advised my parents not to open up a legal investigation because they said it would further traumatize me. when i initially came forward the director of the school refused to listen to me. it was a nightmare. when i graduated school i moved out of the city and he found out where i lived and began stalking me. he ended up kidnapping me and taking me back to his home studio and showed me a shrine he made of me. he continued stalking me until my friend's weed dealer called him and threatened to murder him on his front lawn. it all stopped. i tried to move forward but it took seventeen years of suffering to finally go to the press. it was a complete fucking nightmare. i came out with my story a year ago and i am just beginning to get better. i'm going to college for the first time and i'm getting my life back on track. i haven't written anything substantial in the last 17 years because of his except some fan fiction because it's too painful and i'm still afraid to tap into those emotions.

7131	23473	32	bu766u	ep8qdsq	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	back in kindergarten, we did this thing on thanksgivings that you switch classrooms with other students and i was one to switch. it is worth mentioning that i had a cough because it was the time of year when it gets cold and people get a little sickly. while the teacher was reading i would cough every now and then, but she at one point snapped and yelled at me. she threaten to give me a referral if i coughed again. i then spent the entire rest of the day holding in coughs and being miserable. i am 20 now but still remember this story.

7138	23473	28	bu766u	ep8xh5i	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	not me, but a guy from hs. we were on school camp and a guys brother had just been put in prison for a dui crash that killed his mate in the passenger seat. &#x200b; our school pastor thought it would be a great idea to play a documentary on the movie night about driving under the influence and the effects of accidents. the kid was obviously upset with this so left the room, the pastor then proceeded to single him out and tell the entire year level that his brother had just been jailed for vehicular manslaughter under the influence. it was not common knowledge until that moment.

7141	23473	25	bu766u	ep97hv1	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i will be hosting a waynes world viewing party in the math departments meeting room. all are invited not really traumatic. more extremely uncomfortable. first some background, this professor is actually a very nice person, just extremely awkward. he shows his class memes from 2012. anyway, i was a college freshmen eager to earn some brownie points, so i decided id go watch waynes world. id actually seen it before with my dad. my roommate came along just incase i was the only one to show up. we ended up being the only people to show up. he had a bunch of snacks on the table that went on. probably fewer than 50 words were exchanged and my friend an i wee texting each other that we should find an excuse to leave, but we didnt end up leaving. there were snacks on the table that went unopened through the entire movie. i ended up getting an a in the class, so i suppose it was worth it. i did continue to have some odd encounters with this professor though. dr. s, if your reading this, party on.
7142	23473	24	bu766u	ep8iwbl	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i moved to a new school in 2nd grade, i was shy about singing in music class and basically didn't at all, or do the little hand motions or whatever. she would single me out and embarrass me in front of the class every class, but i did and still do like music, and i participated in the non-singing parts of the class. it came to a head in 5th grade and i was allowed not to go to music class at the very end of elementary school. by this point i was already playing in orchestra with a different teacher who came to the school only for orchestra, and i continued playing through high school cuz music is fun.
7143	23473	22	bu766u	ep8y14r	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"i auditioned for the school talent show and performed a (shit) song, but the teacher who was judging the auditions was so fucking mean, i think she fancied herself as an x factor judge. she absolutely destroyed me, i wasn't expecting it at all. she also later told one of my little sisters who also attended the school that people like her and her family were the reason the school was failing (because my single parent mum hadn't been able to afford the 150 per child per term ""voluntary"" donation). she became principle and from that point on used to walk around the school with a floor-length real fur coat, i shit you not."
7144	23473	23	bu766u	ep9fmj2	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	didnt happen to me but it still makes my blood boil. small town, one of my classmates in grade 10 english was dating the teachers best-friends daughter. he was a decent kid, well liked, he just had troubles in school and was a bit hyperactive. well, an untrue rumour had started earlier in the day that he had cheated on his girlfriend. by our block in the afternoon in grade 10 the rumour had been cleared up. apparently it was started in spite by a previous friend of the guy. anyways, apparently the teacher hadnt received the news just the content of the rumour. class starts and the teacher (who is a known bully) starts off by saying today you are going to hear a special piece of literature in order to comprehend the importance of spelling and grammar. immediately the hairs stand on up on the back of my neck. i was a shy kid and raised to do our best at respecting our elders but my mom was one to root for the underdog. i had this feeling, i just knew what she was planning to do, she was going for the jugular. and it didnt feel right. i stood up (kind of stunned with myself) and yelled you better stop this bullshit. picture the quietest easily bullied kid in your class saying it. the rest of the class didnt comprehended my intent and i froze or maybe they just wanted to witness the drama. anyways, i got a few shut the fuckups from classmates and the teacher chirps in yes please do, are you crazy? i look directly into the guys eyes and he mouths its okay. and i mouth im sorry. still frozen with tears in my eyes. in high sight i should have just ran to the office but i was scared. the teacher then proceeds to read out a very personal letter that she says is written by a guy to his girlfriend. it includes details about how the author was sexual abused by his step-father at 14 and the confusing feelings he had about the situation and thoughts of suicide. (this is the 1990s and sexual abuse wasnt well understood and the victim would sometimes be shamed for apparently wanting it. yes, i lived in the sticks.) she also intentionally stumbled at every grammatical and spelling error. she then turns to the guy and says see if you wanted to confess your feelings to your girlfriend, you should have edited first. the class bursts out laughing. the guy is just emotionally stunned. i didnt know how it impacted him and was too shy to even ask. and it just wasnt ever discussed. that kind of bullying was so normalized. and i stupidly worried id be in trouble too for failing him and worried nobody would believe me. and afraid id be bullied more. luckily the rumour mill didnt fly. he had good friends i guess. but, some kids would always tease him and say daddy wants a bj. years later drunk at our high school reunion he came up and asked if i could chat. he then proceeds to thank me for my kindness and apologize for never standing up for me. i said but i failed you. he said you didnt, you tried. he said that it was discovered the girlfriend had given the letter to her mom out of fear for his safety. and the teacher had taken it from her best friend (this lady was a bully to everyone). the teacher had since past away from cancer. to this day i sometimes wake up screaming stop stop you bitch. nobody will probably ever read this but glad i got it out. thanks for askreddit, it can be quite therapeutic.
