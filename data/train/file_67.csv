"caviar. my grandfather was in the royal engineers. he was in a flying column that captured a train containing the personal baggage of general manstein. most of the troops were scotsmen from the argyll and sutherland highlanders. they went through the general's wagon car and found some tins of caviar amongst other luxury foodstuffs. it was suggested that this should be reserved for the officers' mess but my grandfather, who was a colonel, said: no, no, let it be distributed amongst the men. and went off feeling very democratic and noble. next day, he was informed there was some grumbling amongst the other ranks so he rounded up the sergeants and asked what the problem was. apparently, they thought the officers had been handing them rotten food. 'look at this, sorr', one said showing an open tin of caviar: ""this jam tastes of fush""."
