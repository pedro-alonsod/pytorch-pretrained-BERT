"wedding processionals. the wedding party practices the processional repeatedly with the minister and organist to time it and make it go smoothly. but on the actual day of the wedding, the procession never goes as rehearsed. sometimes the bride hesitates at the back of the church (perhaps ""nervous""), long after everyone else in the procession has gone before her and the organist runs out of music."

"telling the truth. i've lost count the number times i've told someone something word for word and they don't believe me. most of the time their excuse ""but you're such a good lier is impossible to know when you're telling the truth"" one person in particular used this excuse but i had never lied to them but i have lied in front of them so i guess their reasoning is a little justified."
