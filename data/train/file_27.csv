3854	37707	2316	btb5si	eovkmwi	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	all your interactions with them are on their terms, not on yours. obviously, everyone's different, and so you'll always have to make some kinds of compromises when you do something with another person - whether that's picking things to do that neither of you love but both of you enjoy, or picking things that one person loves one day and the other the next. but if you find that you're constantly having to put some part of your personality or interests aside in order to interact with someone on their terms instead of yours, that's not a healthy friendship. and that doesn't have to inherently be anything wrong with you or them, or make either of you bad people, which is why it can be so hard to break off a friendship like that, but if you're not on an equal footing it's not going to be healthy or helpful for either of you.

3861	37707	2760	btb5si	eovmkxb	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when you overhear them making plans (seemingly fun plans you'd enjoy) with your other friends. i'm anti-social but it still hurts, asking would be nice edit: i'm probably the problem in my case, but this is still a red flag for normal functioning humans. and to clarify i do not reject them constantly, maybe it was poorly worded but by antisocial i meant i find it can be more stressful than worth to make plans. but if someone else is happy to make plans i'd enjoy i'll happily come
3862	37707	14552	btb5si	eovpgue	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	they act just fine whenever they invite you over, and then as soon as someone else comes into the picture, their whole attitude changes. they begin treating you with disrespect, just to try and act cool in front of their new friend. edit: jesus i was not expecting this to blow up the way that it did. yall got some shitty ass friends. 
3863	37707	1327	btb5si	eovzy32	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	if they talk shit on another person to you then pretend to be that person's friend to their face, guess what they're talking about when you're not around edit: this is a general rule of mine and it obviously doesn't fit everybody. there's times when it's ok to talk about friends but there is definitely a line, i don't need you all to define that line for me
3864	37707	650	btb5si	eovs4qv	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"you're putting all the work into the friendship. had one friend who i was really close with in college and shortly after. were roommates a couple times for about 3.5 years. after i moved out the last time and for about 5 years after that, i realized the initiating of hanging out (even though we were in the same town) nearly always started with me. him rsvp-ing yes to my wedding, then blowing it off was the last straw. my wedding was over the holidays so i expected some people not to be able to make it, but no phone call, no text to say ""sorry man, family stuff came up."" pretty shitty imo."

3873	37707	687	btb5si	eovl87b	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	always insulting you, insisting it's a joke, getting upset if you say anything back. it might sound obvious but it took me way too long to realize what a problem it was, and even longer to realize i didn't have to put up with it.
3874	37707	937	btb5si	eovuvxm	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	as a rule of thumb: do they make your life better? if not, then it's not a good friendship. i came to this realization with a couple of long term friends i had from back in the day. they would never really do anything nice for you, we basically just hung out out of habit. you couldn't expect them to be there for you if you needed a favor, even small ones. with one there was also constant ribbing, he'd play it off as joking, but it was closer to insults. i eventually came to the realization that these guys don't make my life better in any way. i can replace them with people who actually give a shit. this may come off as selfish sounding, but you have to remember to reciprocate and be a good friend too. if your friend needs a favor, and it's not unreasonable and you can do it, then do it. if you're always there for a friend and they don't reciprocate, then you're just being used. if you're not there for your friend but expect them to be there for you, then you're the one who is a tool.
3875	37707	505	btb5si	eovkeob	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"when you feel that their compliments are just an attempted ""emotional investment"" to get you to do something for them in the near future."

3877	37707	311	btb5si	eovsmlj	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	you are drained after you hang out. edit: not drained in the sense where an introvert feels drained by social interaction. other posters said it better than i did. its drained in the sense that you give everything to this person in terms of attention and receive little in return. its the friend who can quite literally only talk about themselves for hours and hours. its usually about some trivial problem theyve decided they want to psychoanalyze yet again. bonus points for exhausting amounts of repetition and reaching years into the past to retread old ground. you are lucky to get a word on edgewise. if you do get a word in, friend will turn that convo back to their interests whiplash fast. rinse, repeat into infinity.
3878	37707	405	btb5si	eovtjzs	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when you tell them something only to them, then later on, everybody knows about it.
3879	37707	101	btb5si	eowday6	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when you want to make plans to hang out with them and all they do is make very weak excuses without offering a different date. and then.they later blame you for not putting in effort to hang out.
3880	37707	270	btb5si	eovsdvm	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	if they don't listen to you in conversations but rather are sitting there waiting for their turn to speak, it's a dealbreaker. if they are permanently an innocent victim, surrounded by wrongdoers, that's a dealbreaker. if they are a drama-mama or a drama-papa, that is a deal.break.er. if they only call you when they need something, they are *using* you. dealbreaker if they are not happy for you when something good happens, but instead lament how they are not as happy - dealbreaker. if they exclude you intentionally, talk about you behind your back, spill your secrets. those are major dealbreakers, shut it down.
3881	37707	245	btb5si	eovxq52	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when they are never happy for you when you achieve something you've been working hard for, and instead try to bring you down ('are you sure you can cope with that level of responsibility?' 'do you really think you'll fit into that company?'). allied to this, they are judgmental and bad mouth you and criticise you to mutual friends. they can't be trusted with keeping your problems secret-they gossip simply for the sake of putting you down because that makes them feel superior. bitterness and envy-a genuine friend would be happy for you. when all the arrangements are left up to you-you do all the running, all the organising, booking the cinema/theatre etc, you do all the driving collecting them for events or nights out. they freeload without any reciprocity. they lack empathy-they expect you to be there for their crises (like relationship break ups), but don't reciprocate. they don't want to know about your stresses and problems, they only want the fun bits. they suck the life and spirit out of you-if you start to feel stressed or worried at the thought of meeting up with them, and if you feel exhausted and drained at the end of the evening with them, its not a healthy relationship. a friendship should leave you feeling energised and happy, not miserable.
3882	37707	311	btb5si	eowb5nq	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	1. they only talk to you when they need/ want something 2. they bring you into unnecessary drama 3. they tell all your secrets 4. they make you feel bad about yourself when you go to them with your problems. 5. you only hang out on their terms. 6. they manipulate you when you dont realize. 7. when ever you do some thing good they put you down and try to one up you. 8. they are never happy for you. 9. they only tell you what you do wrong and not what you do good. 10. they blame stuff on you because  its okay youre their friend. hope this helps! do not allow toxic people in your life. i could go on and on but i wont bore you. have a nice day:). ahhhh thanks for the gold stranger 
3883	37707	81	btb5si	eowabsd	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	this one's personal but when they treat you like shit twice, so you forgive them twice and they still do it. recently ended a friendship because of this.

3887	37707	137	btb5si	eowcaxw	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when they hate you for your success. anything good that happens to you is a reason for them to resent you, insult you, belittle you. the best friends in my life, i am genuinely happy for them when they get promoted or engaged or having something amazing happen for them, just as they are genuinely happy for me. bad friends don't do that.

3892	37707	52	btb5si	eowanjv	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	you're not allowed to talk about your problems and struggles with them. for example they will call you selfish or say stuff like how they or others have it way worse so you're not allowed to feel down. but they always expect you to help them and listen to them about their problems and you're probably a major bitch or asshole to them if you don't.

3896	37707	400	btb5si	eovn18o	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when youre going through a hard time and they distance themselves from you. id been friends with my ex since we broke up and she suddenly stopped talking to me while i was in a really bad place and she saw something that indicated i might relapse (ive been sober like 8 months) and she said basically dont speak to me again and cancelled our upcoming plans. the reality was, i was just using the post as a way to vent because my last support system in my life (her) disappeared so i just needed someone to talk to. but ive had more or less the same experience with everyone ive called a friend. but ya know what? good riddance to all those people. if im around long enough maybe ill find friends and girlfriends who dont abandon me.

3915	37707	23	btb5si	eowxiw2	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"a lot of these are about the other person being dicks. but here's one that's not: if they're always agreeing with you/always know about the same band/movie/tv show/game you're talking about. &#x200b; when i was younger i had a friend and if you took him on face value, he liked all the same stuff as me! but he had no insight into them (like, he likes all their songs dude, they're all so good, it's hard to pick just one favourite). &#x200b; many people said he's a liar and to cut him off, he's a bad person, can't trust him, etc. &#x200b; but he was just trying to connect with me, and i guess he felt like he needed to impress me? so i flipped the switch and started modelling behaviour for him. ie ask him what music he's listening to - and even if i have heard it, say ""oh i haven't heard of them, what's some good songs? you should put it on now while we drive"" etc. eventually this gave him the confidence to do the same back - he realised he didn't have to know everything to be cool, that the coolness came from sharing experiences and introducing people to new shit. that the feeling he got of niceness when i'd say ""hey i checked out that show, it's really good!"" also comes with a good feeling for him. whereas to many others in our group he was the ""annoying yes man"" and they'd just reject him and leave him out of shit."

"only ever wanting to ""hang out"" when they need a ride somewhere because they don't have a car or license. gatekeeping friends for themselves and bragging about fun times with other friends just to make you feel left out and like you need to try harder to be liked. hurting themselves for revenge after you call them out for their bullshit. manipulatively telling your friend that they're bad friends simply because they don't always agree with you or can't always spare time for you because they have their own lives. acting poor so people will buy you things like food and mooching off of friends. using sexuality on friends who are romantically interested in them to manipulate them into doing their bidding. i've had a lot of good friends if you couldn't tell."
3929	37707	16	btb5si	eoxerao	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"* they never sincerely ask how you are doing, but you do. * you show up to support things they do, but then they don't even ask about the things you do and never show support. * they cause problems in the friendship and never talk about it or shrug it off without getting closure. * you know who they are and where they are from. but, they don't know anything about you or even seem interested. * you have to constantly contact them to do things but if you don't they never contact you. * they never reciprocate leaving you feeling used. * they get mad at you for something, you make an effort to be more conscious about it. you make a simple request and they completely ignore it even if it makes you feel uncomfortable. * after talking to or being around them you feel drained and worse than before something i've been stuggling with which i would love an opinion. i've always been the one to get my friends together to do things. i got sick of having to do that all the time and said ""you know, i'm just gonna wait for them to initiate and see how long it takes"". i went for 6+ months without any of my friends contacting me at all. do you think they suck or i'm just the person to get them together to do things because that's who i am?"

3933	37707	28	btb5si	eowmyk3	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	you feel oblgated to talk to them. they guilt you if you don't talk to them. my best friends are the ones i sometimes don't talk to or see for years, but when i do it's like no time has passed.

3936	37707	14	btb5si	eowx5qp	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	never planning hang outs, calling , texting first. basically never initiating any type of contact unless they need something or will get something out of it. oh, and if they bail or flake on plans all the time.
3937	37707	36	btb5si	eovnkxg	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	demanding to see the others phone for no reason and just general mistrust
3938	37707	39	btb5si	eovv5nf	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	anyone who you call to catch up with that starts off with why havent you called sooner or any iteration of that garbage. you havent called me yet you want to give me crap about how long its been since i called? even being said in a joking tone it really boils down to that person isnt actually glad you called to catch up but more concerned with why you didnt think of them sooner. people have busy lives and dont always take the time to talk to the people they care about but the person who starts a conversation like that isnt worth calling back. fun fact : its easy to dump those types of friends, just dont call them. they will never think to call you. one friend of more than 20 years used to do this every time i called, i stopped and havent heard from them for several years.

"always talking about themselves and not listening if you talk about your problems for once. also if you helped them but they never help you. people who try to bring you down to feel better about themselves most of my friends were like this. it took me a big.amount of self awareness and working on my mentality to get rid of people like that and find some good people. well i only found 1 really good friend so far but all i need to know is that i dont fall for those type of ""friends"" anymore"

3943	37707	28	btb5si	eovviuu	what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"when someone refuses to take responsibility for their own actions and, instead, tries to justify them. that's exactly how i lost my best friend: he did and said a handful of things that hurt me, and when i confronted him about it, he made up excuses and justifications for everything, making it seem as if i was just being ""dramatic"". i wanted to be as honest and straightforward as possible, and yet he never seemed to give a fuck whenever his actions affected other people. in that moment, i realized that he cared more about his ego rather than about his best friend's feelings. lack of responsibility is a huge red flag."
