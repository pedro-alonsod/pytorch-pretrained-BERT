6271	29681	26	btfu8k	eoy1ddh	what's the dumbest thing you've ever done because your brain was on autopilot?	first year in public school (i transferred in the sixth grade), i was invited to someone's table to sit (not the first time it happened). if i was awkward in private school, i was definitely known as the weird kid in junior high. i also tended to space out, a habit i'd picked up at some point in my development. so i'm at this table, it's mostly a table of girls, and i'm quiet around them. i space out into my own little world. but when i come to, i realize i'm apparently gazing straight at a girl across from me. and what more, she's looking straight back at me with a really concerned and unsure look on my face. someone eventually told me that she'd found me creepy, which i couldn't blame for. but we ended up friends in the later half of high school. i also once took my dog's medication instead of benadryl. that might've been a funnier story in hindsight.

"i made a ""meow"" noise at a puppy once, and rather than admit to my friend that i managed to confuse a dog with a cat, i said ""oh, i just make meow noises at anything small and cute"" and i've been maintaining the lie so for long that it's become a legitimate habit. i've been making meow noises at things like babies, ferrets, etc for years now."
