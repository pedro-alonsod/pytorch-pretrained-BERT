3436	39873	7740	bo3owh	enc3zaw	what's the best job for a lazy person?	a guy on the surveying crew has the job of watching a surveying gps unit all day. he gets dropped off with the unit, sets it up and sits there and makes sure it doesn't get stolen and that the blue light is still on. that's all he does every day, day after day. he thinks his job is the greatest thing ever.
3437	39873	2845	bo3owh	encied4	what's the best job for a lazy person?	sys admin, i hate my life i've automated 85% of my job, i'd be shocked if i worked more than 4hrs on a average week. it sounds great but fuck its boring sitting here surfing tomorrows reddit today.
3438	39873	4023	bo3owh	enc6jk0	what's the best job for a lazy person?	a lot of it-related office jobs* at big companies involve a lot of down time for one reason or another, where you're just sitting around waiting for work to come in. just be careful what you wish for. i did a six-month work placement at a place doing qc on medical data entry (it was as riveting as it sounds) and due to poor management there were massive stretches of time--like, more than a solid week--where there was nothing for us to do. we were literally begging for work because we were so fucking bored. if someone had asked me to start hoovering the carpets, i would have jumped at the chance. *creative it jobs like the video games and special effects industries are major exceptions
3439	39873	17649	bo3owh	enc3jdl	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i worked as a security guard for a trucking company on the weekends. the rest of the company conveniently didn't work weekends so i had the whole place to myself. i worked 12 hour days and walked around a small wing of the property every hour and documented anything that was out of the ordinary (almost nothing was ever out of the ordinary). other than that i didn't do anything. it was actually really boring because the guardhouse was outside of the wifi area so i blew through my phone data really fast. to cure the boredom and ease my phone bill i bought a portable dvd player and watched every dvd i had.

3444	39873	2762	bo3owh	encb5xb	what's the best job for a lazy person?	"copy editor. you can pretty much work out of your own home and be a professional grammar nazi. pay is meh but it's really not bad once you build up a client base since you can literally sit on your ass for hours if your grasp on the language is strong edit: i should probably clarify: i do this part-time after i get home from my main office job. i consider it ""lazy"" because i can sit in my own home office and dedicate what time i wish to it, and it requires no specialized equipment (besides a laptop)"
3445	39873	15628	bo3owh	enccvtk	what's the best job for a lazy person?	"i used to go to the factory where they make giant rotating machinery for power plant generators. it would take a week or more to machine these giant disks and the ""machinist"" just sat there watching this giant, computer operated machine do all the work. if an error popped up, the machine would stop, sound an alarm on the computer, and the ""machinist"" .would pick up the phone and call an engineer to come fix it. also they didn't do any of the removal or set up, that was done by a team of engineers and ""transport"" folks. $30/hr."

3449	39873	181	bo3owh	endgyuo	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i love that you asked what job is for lazy people rather than go find it. true laziness.
3450	39873	1060	bo3owh	enchdvg	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i worked as a security guard for a few years. their policy was going around the perimeter of the plaza twice per shift. it took about 30 min each, and they dont care what you do for the rest of it. so really you're getting paid by simple scarecrowing around and scaring off potential beggars or hobos only an hr of your 8 hr shift. while it wasnt high pay, the expectations are so low that it sort of justified it. not all security areas are the same.
3451	39873	319	bo3owh	end4gog	what's the best job for a lazy person?	my job. i make the ballistic fiber that goes in bullet proof vests. i basically just watch movies and play on my phone all day long while the machine runs. as long as everything goes smoothly i have around 5 minutes of work to do every hour and a half whenever the machines is ready to run new packages. and i'm on break half of the day too because we do 1 hour on the floor, then swap out with our relief for an hour. so every other hour you're on break for an hour. and i have a 2 hour lunch. i make $30.23 an hour and all the overtime i want
3452	39873	2150	bo3owh	enc3flg	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i worked at a pool the summer after my senior year of high school. i wasnt a lifeguard, i just had to have the person show me their navy card to get in the pool, and i had to check the ph levels of the pool at the end of everyday. only had to text my boss, could be on my phone the whole day, chilled with my then girlfriend, and ate food. didnt even have to clock out for lunch and got an extra half an hour every day. the down side was working in the hot sun, youd be under an umbrella but the job could get boring! edit: i should also add most of my friends were navy kids whose mothers or fathers were working so i would be able to chill with them all day too because it was their neighborhood. all in all pretty good gig if youre lazy edit 2: also one time me and my friends were there and there was a live skunk in the pool filter. he was trying to swim so we took a pool net and gently pushed him into it and let him down in the grass outside he was just laying on his back panting frantically then he jumps up and runs in the woods. i have it on film on my old iphone edit 3: wow 1.6k more people liked this job than i thought, guys you really dont want to work at a pool lmao
3453	39873	1635	bo3owh	enc0ymg	what's the best job for a lazy person?	programming for microsoft products gives you a lot of time not working. if anyone catches me not working, i just say i'm waiting on the build since our main product takes about four hours to finish.
3454	39873	575	bo3owh	encx4z2	what's the best job for a lazy person?	truck driving. and not in a bad way. i drove a semi for a few years after the military and it is by far the best job for low energy introverts. you get paid to do nothing other than stare out a window and listen to music/podcasts/radio. you have to get out every now and then for work, but you won't be doing any back breaking work and it won't be longer than 10-15 minutes at most. best job if you like to be alone and not really have to do anything. plus it pays really well.
3455	39873	260	bo3owh	encgctp	what's the best job for a lazy person?	corporate job. they typically give you work they think will take a week. it does. youre just slowly trodding through it in between useless meetings and facebook.

3459	39873	976	bo3owh	enc25fa	what's the best job for a lazy person?	hurricane debris cleanup crew safety monitor this wont apply to you unless you live in a place where you are hit by hurricanes at least once a year and dont minding working 12 hour days, 7 days a week. i promise you that 10 of those 12 hours per day will be spent sitting there, doing nothing, playing games on your phone if the battery lasts long enough. i switched to crossword puzzles to try and save my battery. keep in mind this job only exists immediately after a hurricane hits and then for about 4-5 months afterwards, depending on the strength of the hurricane. you will get time and a half on the final 44 hours of the week, so you essentially get paid for the work of someone who has two decent entry level jobs without actually performing anywhere near that amount of work
3460	39873	945	bo3owh	encnaf1	what's the best job for a lazy person?	automation design. been doing it for 26 years and my laziness has advanced my career more than anything else. i \*hate\* doing anything twice, so if i have to do it once, i do it in a manner that the next time it's needed it handles itself.

3462	39873	217	bo3owh	encwtw2	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i'm currently working as a companion for rich old folks with early stage dementia. their kids feel guilty for not spending time with them so they pay me (too much) to go to the old folks home everyday, hang out, drive their fancy cars and go out for lunch. most don't wake up til after midday so i do whatever i want all morning. my old guy now likes to go to this expensive restaurant everyday for lunch (full on 3 courses with a bottle of wine) which to be honest has become a bit much for me. every few days i send the kids a happy smiley pic of the old timer having a good time and they get the warm fuzzes. ill drive the jag or rolls, get them a paper but don't do any personal care at all. its a sweet gig!

3464	39873	102	bo3owh	endbpjo	what's the best job for a lazy person?	"i'm sure this will likely be lost in the other awesome jobs. but i once had a job that required maybe 10 minutes of work a day. essentially, it was my job to rent people mobility scooters. i'd sit in a small room surrounded by different coloured scooters and i'd just read or watch movies with my feet up because we had maybe 2-4 ""customers"" a day. if a person came in for a scooter, i'd ask for their name and post code, write it down on a piece of paper and give them the keys. when they came back i would, usually an hour or two later, i'd charge the scooter by just plugging it in. that's all. the entire job. the work really slowed when the local government started charging for the formally free service. then i'd maybe see 3 people a week. and they paid me 8 per hour."

3467	39873	2453	bo3owh	enchi3n	what's the best job for a lazy person?	get an office job, figure out how to do it in a fraction of the time. coast for a couple of years. when a co-worker quits, tell your boss that you can add their responsibilities to yours instead of hiring a new person (for a 40% raise.) figure out how to do *that* in a fraction of the time. get all your work done every day, and also spend hours on reddit. bonus: literally nobody else knows how to do your job, so they'll think long and hard before downsizing you. (it helps if you understand excel, or whatever your office uses, more than anybody else in the company.)
3468	39873	1164	bo3owh	encesy8	what's the best job for a lazy person?	it ain't a game tester. people think it's a fun an easy job but tracking down the precise instant a bug happens under what conditions is a pain staking, tedious and time consuming task.

3472	39873	311	bo3owh	encxbfp	what's the best job for a lazy person?	it depends on what kind of lazy you are - work hard 1-2 decades and chill for the rest of your life lazy, or wake up at 11am and go to work at 2pm kind of lazy. someone in my family works as an anesthesiologist and another as a neurophysiologist. both work literally 10-15 hours a week for $150k-225k a year. they worked hard through their education and got lucky at parts, but the payoff is being lazy / retirement capable by age 40 if you're willing to retire to a cheaper country, or \~60 if you invest / save well and want to stay in the states. alternatively, some of my laziest friends (gamers, potheads) work remote as software engineers / web engineers. this work is task based and relatively independent (depending what company you work for), and if you seek out projects for startups / small growing companies you also get to try your luck at making it big with pieces of equity here and there.
3473	39873	136	bo3owh	enczqzs	what's the best job for a lazy person?	working at a visitors center along a interstate. my buddy works at one along i-15 and he just sits in a chair and points things out on a map to people all day. he basically is on one long break. he steps out back whenever know one is around and tokes his e-pen. so basically he sits in an air conditioned little room and tells people where cools spots are and fun things to do on their trip. plus you get to meet all sorts of interesting and creepy people. all while being baked off his ass.
3474	39873	135	bo3owh	end9dni	what's the best job for a lazy person?	not sure if it qualifies but i used to oversee gas pressure on an outlet on an oil rig. id just sit there for 12h/day for up to 4 weeks at a time. nothing ever happened and if it did there wouldnt be much time to act accordingly. id just be the first to know that we would all die very soon.
3475	39873	68	bo3owh	encxt7t	what's the best job for a lazy person?	in college, i was the substitute proctor for a standardized test company. they would hold practice exams, and i would just say 'start', set an alarm, and say 'end' when it was done. that was basically it. didn't have to look for people cheating, because if you're paying $1000 to take a class and you cheat on the practice exam, then that's on you. easiest beer money in the world, and i got to do work or read during it.
3476	39873	64	bo3owh	enczq24	what's the best job for a lazy person?	one time i had a sweet gig as an overnight caregiver for a sweet old lady neighbor of my mom's friend. she lives alone, is around 90, super mentally and physically with it. she just gets scared at night and likes the company. i would go over at around 8pm, watch dancing with the stars or whatever with her, discuss current events, and would usually end up going to bed before her at around 11 (she didn't mind as long as i was in the house). i would wake up and have breakfast with her, then leave around 7 or 8 the next morning. she paid $100/night. i did this for a while when i was preparing for my nclex and for a bit after i passed. i had to leave because i got a job as a camp nurse, and then i ended up moving and getting a real job so i didn't try to get that job back. i hope she's still alive and that someone else is filling in as well as i did - they were some pretty big, lazy shoes to fill.

3480	39873	83	bo3owh	end18bs	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i lucked out massively at uni, i responded to an ad to build an alumni website that had a few unique features. during the interview they asked how i would build a specific feature and i basically said, i'm not sure i'd have to do some research - apparently every other candidate had arrogantly said they could do it easily and it rubbed up the interviewers the wrong way - i literally got the job because i said i wasn't sure! it was amazing money for a broke student, an hourly contract rate wayyy higher than my previous bar & retail work. they were happy for me to work from home providing i sent them updates by way of various documents and prototypes. i basically clocked in shit ton of hours as i could just fire up my laptop when i had some free time and crack on. this went on for ages. unfortunately the (phd?) project managers found out they were not allowed to carry on with the project and the funding was pulled. i basically billed a shit ton of hours, got to hack some code whenever i had time and i never had to finish the product. it was easily the cushiest gig i've ever had, and absolute gold as a student. sadly bills had to be paid and i had to pick up some regular work (which was also awesome, but no way this good). tl;dr hired for a programming gig because i didn't know what i was doing. was allowed to work whenever i want from home, and ultimately the project was cancelled. got to learn some awesome stuff and got paid good money to do it!
3481	39873	273	bo3owh	enc28jm	what's the best job for a lazy person?	software developer, because the lazy developer finds the easiest way of doing something.
3482	39873	109	bo3owh	encwuas	what's the best job for a lazy person?	late to the party, but my job fits. it took about a month to memorize the details of the documents i look at and how to enter the data in our system. since then its been literally no work. open pdf. open data program. enter correct name and ssn. hit f7 until it says next. hit f9 until it says next. repeat. each document has about 300 questions and i could probably do one in 20 minutes with my eyes closed, besides entering a date or two. its such a do nothing job that ive gained 60 pounds in 4 years, and watched about 8\*5\*52\*4 hours of netflix/hulu/twitch. all while getting paid $50k a year. bonus: i am the top performer on my team. most completions, fewest mistakes. it is really a joke.

3487	39873	37	bo3owh	end7j0r	what's the best job for a lazy person?	lifeguard at a retirement complex. i did this every summer throughout high school and university, and never once did i have to intervene or do anything. my regular clientele consisted of four old ladies who would meet each morning to chat and sunbathe, and one very fit old dude who would swim laps at the end of the day. i suppose it would have been more work if any emergencies had actually happened though.

3489	39873	246	bo3owh	enclmr1	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i worked as a personal shopper for a couple of years and it was the chillest and easiest job i have ever had. it was part of this app/website so i worked remotely from home basically just googling things for people and trying to find the best price. i actually found it through reddit in one of the job subreddits and it was a small startup company that had only been around for a few months. i honestly don't know how it lasted as long as it did because we didn't charge for our services and although we had partnerships with many companies and websites, sometimes we ordered through ebay and amazon since they would end up being the cheapest option. we also didn't have that huge of a customer base and most days were super slow. it was pretty nice for me, got paid $16/hour to basically just watch tv all day and wait to see if we had any requests, most of which wouldn't even take that long. they finally ended up closing last year, but it was an interesting run and if anything i am really good at finding deals for myself now when i want to buy something.

3500	39873	26	bo3owh	endqizk	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i was a security guard in a closed linkbelt factory in chicago. this building took up 11 city blocks. it was freaking huge! 12 hour shifts. this was in 1975 so no mobile phones, computers, and dvd players were the size of atms. there was only one room in this place that had heat. it was the power room for all the overhead cranes. the temperature, even in the summer was in the 40s you had to wear a jacket. in the winter it was colder than the outside freezing temperatures. the floor was oil soaked wooden blocks, which i shoveled up in a 55 gallon drum and set on fire for heat. but, on the plus side, the power was still on to the cranes that ran on a rail at the top of a 70 foot ceiling. i got pretty good at 55 gallon drum bowling, using the crane hook to swing into the barrels. i was a student and the pay was good. there was plenty of study time.

3502	39873	167	bo3owh	encpixt	what's the best job for a lazy person?	you can grow up on a farm, and then join the navy because you think it's less work than farming. they'll want you to do a lot of work at the naval academy, however, which you can get out of by studying lots of math so the leadership will think you're a geek with geek potential rather than a jock with command potential. then they'll offer you a chance to fly a plane, because you can't be stupid and fly a plane and everyone knows you're good at math. but flying a single-man plane is lots of work, you have to be at 100% all the time you're in the air, so you can transfer to *big* planes with multi-man crews and co-pilots, and since all your co-workers really want to transfer *out* of big planes because they're not flashy and heroic, you keep getting promoted and promoted until you're the first person in your class to make captain. eventually since you know everything there is to know about big planes, by being the only officer in the entire navy who's flown them for an entire career, you start inventing new stuff that makes even less work for yourself. stuff such as autopilots and navigation assistants. then a war breaks out, and you figure the safest thing to do is to fly rescue missions in your flying boat picking up downed fighter pilots, which paradoxically allows you to garner decorations for heroism. then after the war you retire honorably as a junior admiral, known for your amazing exploits as the man too lazy to fail.

3504	39873	24	bo3owh	enct1p3	what's the best job for a lazy person?	"i used to work for a juvenile delinquent ""camp"". my job was to sit in or by the cabin overnight and make sure none of the kids ran off. the job requirement consisted of radioing in once an hour, writing ""no issues"" or ""latrine"" on each kids' log sheet, and keeping yourself awake. it paid 50% more than a fast food job, and as long as you did the job you could do pretty much whatever you wanted the rest of the time. biggest catch was there was no power and up to a half mile hike to the cabin."

3507	39873	19	bo3owh	end4abk	what's the best job for a lazy person?	field engineer. hear me out. field engineers are often salaried, and are given territories with a list of things that need completed as well as their due dates and barring a few emergency callouts, that's the full scope of their work. or, if they're of the flavor of fe that i am (energy distribution), they do global work but only have seasons where they are busy and occasionally deal with callouts during off season. so as an fe, you spend a few months out of the year busting your ass and working long days, and once the busy time ends, you sit at home for weeks and play video games or do whatever you want while collecting a paycheck. i just spent the past 12 days binge watching dbz, replaying persona 5, and storyboarding my webcomic. you can't really be lazy until you actually become a field engineer though. something something about being responsible for multimillion dollar equipment and such.

3516	39873	32	bo3owh	end1eqg	what's the best job for a lazy person?	i once worked for a company that had a major database replication every night. sometimes, that replication would fail. if it did, they wouldn't know until morning and then all of their reports would be wrong causing quite a bit of chaos. they promoted me to the software team because of my limited sql skill, but for the first few months my only job was to literally watch a progress bar to see if it stopped moving for more than 15-20 minutes, then call and wake up the db admin if it did so they could debug and restart the replication. no one else was in the building at this time.not even security. i literally brought my 360 in and played mw2 every night, all night for 2-3 months. before the day shift showed up (since the optics would be bad even though i had literally no other responsibilities in the beginning) i just packed everything in my backpack and left. eventually, they realized i was much more valuable than that and i got a great deal more responsibility.but that was a pretty crazy lazy few months.
