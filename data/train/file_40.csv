5123	33126	9645	budsip	epb2cam	what impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	having a limited ability to revert time. can only go back 12 hours at a time, and once the ability is used you need to wait at least the amount of time you re-wound before you can do it again (basically, you can't chain-leap backwards ad infinitum) you could essentially restart the same 12 hours over and over, but once you have let time progress more than 12 hours, that moment will be out of your reach forever. i think about how many times i would loop the same 12 hours before letting time progress, what i would use that extra time for, how i would perhaps slowly turn cold and distant from those around me; seeing them merely as atomatons; doomed to repeat the same mannerisms over and over, before i let time naturally run its course again. there are things that can be progressed in these repeated hours and things that cannot. i could read part of a book, for example, and then continue where i left off when i rewind again, but i wouldn't be able to continue playing a game or travel overseas etc. because any progress i make towards goals that take longer than 12 hours get wiped the instant i rewind. i would be a lonely observer of a day's many possibilities and potential outcomes, only to settle for one that's 'good enough' once the repetitiveness gets stale. would i turn into a sociopath? commit heinous acts because 'i can just rewind anyway?' i'm honestly not sure, i'd like to think not, but it seems like a very possible outcome. okay, maybe i can get a bit carried away sometimes.

5175	33126	14	budsip	epbx3s3	what impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	i often think about a scenario where i am in a big room with about 20 clones of my girlfriend. i am pretty much forced to figure out which is the real one. first, i have to go through and eliminate all the ones that don't look exactly like her physically. i start with more obvious things all the way down to minute details only i know about her body. then go through the process of asking personal questions to the remaining ones and see just how much they know about themselves and also about our own relationship. i ask trick questions or tell certain jokes that i know only the real one would know or like. eventually i get down to just two versions of her and they are almost exactly the same in all aspects. i never really finish the day dream to figure out who i pick though. i just find it fun to try compiling a list of very specific things i know about her to see if it'd be possible to do successfully.
