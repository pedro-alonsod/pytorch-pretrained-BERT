"i run the front desk at a hotel and they are an absolute nightmare. they also straight up lie to the guests and to the hotels constantly. truly one of the most shady companies i've ever dealt with. they purposely try and deceive people who don't know any better into thinking that they are dealing with the hotel directly. they create adds in such a way that when people google the hotel's phone number, a number to expedia comes up, and if the customer asks if the are speaking directly with the hotel front desk they will say yes. there have been countless times where guests have called to cancel their reservation that was booked through expedia. i inform them that they will have to contact expedia directly, since they pre-paid through them, but that it will be no issue because the hotel does not charge a penalty fee for cancellation. an expedia representative will call the hotel with the guest on hold and ask about getting it cancelled. i tell them it's no problem. they ask if we will be charging a penalty fee, and i tell them no. all is right and good, right? nope. i then get a call back from the guest who is upset, saying that the expedia representative told them they could not be refunded because of the fee charged by the hotels cancellation policy. taking the guests money and blaming it on the hotel, and keeping all of the profit. this has happened countless times. i once had a guest while at the front desk call about cancelling 3 days out of a multiple day reservation, as she had to leave earlier than expected. they pulled the same bullshit with her, not knowing that she was at the front desk. after me telling the representative that the cancellation is fine and we will not be charging any penalties, they get back on the phone with her and blatantly lie. i asked her to hand her phone to me and that was quite a surprise for the representative. who said that ""there must have been a misunderstanding""."
978	50935	2555	boxktx	ennuhr3	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	used to be a health inspector. in my first year a lot of my old favorite restaurants were ruined for me, but none so bad as the discount sushi place my college bestie and i used to frequent. they had roaches bad. in my time at the health department i never saw them worse than in that kitchen. we got calls about the roaches at least twice a month, and every time we went they were back with a vengeance. they were closed for them multiple times, but just never kept up with the pest control and cleaning necessary to get rid of them. they were also dying tilapia red and selling it as red snapper on their menu. this is pretty common around here, but it's super illegal because it's literal false advertising. fun fact: some people are allergic to tilapia. not sure i want to be around when that restaurant owner finds that out. they had hundreds of cardboard boxes stacked outside their back door, plus a bunch of old equipment they weren't using. this added to the roach problem and any day it could turn into a rodent problem. one time i drive by and they had animal cages back there, too. i don't wanna know that story. add to that: i'm pretty sure the employees are all indentured servants or victims of human trafficking. they all show up in the same beat up white van every day and work a 12+ hour shift. the owner is unkind to them and they don't respect him. he says he can trust them to do their jobs, but was sketchy when we said to fire them and hire employees who will. we never had proof, but it was always upsetting and struck me as off. he tried to bribe me and my coworkers multiple times, too. i'm not a health inspector anymore but he still tries to give me free food or money when he sees me. he opened a new restaurant and i didn't know it was his, so and friend and i went to go check it out. i was told that appetisers were free for me only. then i saw him in the back. we had to leave. never again. it's too sketchy and too likely to get me sick.
979	50935	2743	boxktx	ennusnf	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	we bought a flea medicine from hartz to use on our cat and she became lethargic and didn't eat anything. we took her to the vet and they told us that they have been trying to get that medicine off the shelves because of how it affects animals. i was in a theater watching despicable me when my cat finally passed away. it sucked knowing that my cat is dead because of some money-hungry brand who doesn't care about the safety of the animals it gives its products to.
980	50935	14449	boxktx	enn7kiv	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"comcast. a door-to-door salesman straight up lied to my dad, saying they had a four-dvr setup that would cost less than what we were paying at&t. when the installation guy got there, he said that no, they didn't have a four-dvr setup, he was told to give us the standard two-dvr setup. which was absolutely not something that would work in a house with six people with wildly different tastes in tv shows. so my dad tells him never mind, we're sticking with at&t then, but because the comcast guy had already installed our new cable box, he couldn't take it back with him, so we had to mail it back to comcast ourselves. the kicker is, five years later comcast tried to bill my parents for the cable box, saying we never sent it back. my parents insisted they did, and comcast wanted the ups receipt, which obviously we no longer had because it was five years ago and we hadn't heard anything from them before this. so my parents refused to pay, comcast sent a collections company after us, and when my parents explained the situation to the collection company, they were like ""those fuckers, we'll take care of this."" that was, thankfully, the end of it."
981	50935	23916	boxktx	enmihul	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"if i see something is being shipped by ontrac, i'll cancel. the three times they were the delivery company from amazon, they lost one package completely and tried to say it wasn't their fault. the second package was also deemed lost but then showed up on my door step something like six weeks later. the third time it sat on ""shipping label created"" for a week and i just contacted amazon and canceled the package. you don't find a lot of positive reviews out there and any positive ones you do find seem like they were written by the company via a fake account."
982	50935	3199	boxktx	enn69pa	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	lyft. they recently charged me a damage fee for damages i could not have plausibly caused. i sent statements explaining how it couldnt have been me. they sent back a standardized statement and didnt give me any additional information. there is no phone line to talk to a representative. i sent them multiple follow up emails, which they never responded to. now i have to write a statement for my credit card company to dispute the charge.
983	50935	9370	boxktx	enmhlku	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"jiffy lube. those idiots told me my car has no filter! im pretty sure they just didnt want to take it out. they also said my car takes a special european oil and charged a lot extra for it. its not a special oil at all. its an uncommon oil but a gallon of it costs the same as typical oil. im going to stick with the dealership to get oil changed because its cheaper and they know what theyre doing. edit : i forgot to add the ending to this story! not long after i got my oil changed, jiffy lube sent me a text message with a link asking to leave a review of their service on google. so i obliged and left the most brutally honest one star review you'd ever read! the next day, the manager called me and left a voicemail. she was very adamant that jiffy lube had to charge a high price for my oil because it ""only can run on special european oil"". in regards to the air filter, she offered an investigation to look at video footage to see if the technicians looked for the air filter. i know they didn't, because i would've seen them take it out! it's inside the engine cover, which they never took off."

"ftd. for mother's day one year, i ordered flowers through them for both of my grandmothers and my mom. i ordered cards, a teddy bear, all of it, right? so my mom sends me a thank you and a picture of what she got. i notice there's no cards, no bear, and it's not the bouquet i ordered for her. i called the company, they gave me a refund, whatever. my mom got flowers and i got a refund--it worked out. i call grandma #1 to wish her a happy mother's day--she got her flowers, but no card or bear. i contact ftd again. refund, again. i call grandma #2. i thought ""there's no way in hell they'll fuck this up again."" yeah, they fucked it up again. at least grandma 2 got her teddy bear, but no card. she didn't even know the flowers were from me. i was so angry with ftd by that point that i didn't even both calling them again. they've lost my business for life."
985	50935	1668	boxktx	ennue2n	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	(warning, disgusting story ahead) i went to dickeys barbecue pit, their food isn't amazing but i was craving southern food and my suburban town in california doesn't have many options. so me and my girlfriend buy some sandwiches and have them for dinner, they're cold and taste like salty sweat. the next day i have uncontrollably shitting liquid shit and vomiting multiple times an hour. if i was alone i would have gone to the emergency room but my dads a nurse and was there. i vomited something like 20 times in the whole day and kept dry heaving afterwards. the diarrhea came so fast and uncontrolled that it ruined multiple pairs of underwear and a rug that was by the toilet (why my dad has rugs in the bathroom i don't know but i shit on it when bent over the toilet). it took only a day for me to feel better and i was already eating heavy foods again, but lo and behold guess who comes over to see me well again and shits herself in my bathroom? my girlfriend, the only other person who ate at dickeys. so i spent the rest of the day, after having just shit and vomited myself to death, helping my girlfriend when she was shitting and vomiting. i think we're closer to each other after that experience. tl;dr: ate at dickeys barbecue pit, shitted and vomited ruining clothes and a rug. gf came over and shit and vomited too.
986	50935	6287	boxktx	enmqmuk	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	wayfair. purchased a $1000 sectional couch that was delivered with damaged upholstery. they refused to let me return it and instead offered me 10% off my next purchase. yeah. never using that discount code.
987	50935	34019	boxktx	enma6i1	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	i bought an engine from autozone for a vehicle i owned. they had a vendor build the engine, and it was supposed to ship to my house. i waited three weeks for it to arrive, but it never did. i contacted their store, was told that it hadn't shipped yet and was coming via fedex freight. i kept up with the tracking # but couldn't get anywhere with it. i kept calling back every couple of days to see what was going on, and no one could figure it out. i finally managed to find out that it had shipped via another company (rl freight), and had been delivered to somewhere else. it was like pulling teeth to get a refund on an engine i never received. it took another two weeks to get the refund. i won't buy a soda from autozone now.
988	50935	5415	boxktx	enm3vcq	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"jdmracingmotors. gave me a damaged motor and claimed a compression test was the only way to test the engine and said it passed. barely held on in one cylinder. to make matters worse, if you put coolant in where it ought to go, it would come out of the oil pan. made a few calls and had email exchanges with their ""mechanics"" and was informed coolant and oil touch regularly and that is how it cools the oil. wrong on so many levels. never got my money back either so i ended up using the good parts from the exterior to rebuild my old engine. &#x200b; edit: this got way more attention than i thought it would! wow. thanks! hope it serves as valuable insight into the risks you take buying used parts."
989	50935	14241	boxktx	enmdj90	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	1800flowers. fuck them. they waited several days after i placed an order for mothers day to tell me that they wouldn't be able to fulfill the order. they waited until the day before, putting me in a bad position. now i google my moms zip, add flowers and have a few choices. i call the local shops directly andq1 1800flowers is cut out of the process.
990	50935	22105	boxktx	enlyvy1	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	frontier internet. they're one of the shittiest isp's i've ever had, i will never go back, no matter how cheap it is.
991	50935	8134	boxktx	enmdnku	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	macys. got a credit card through them to buy a suit. my parents offered to pay the card off as a birthday present. cue months of them calling me 5+ times a day, asking where the payment, that had already been made, was. harassing me to make more and larger payments. when it was finally payed off, they then tacked on a completed payment fee and never sent a bill, so the whole damn thing started all over. i was genuinely about to file a lawsuit over harassment or something. it was unbelievable, because i would tell one person the payment was made, and then get 4 more calls the same day asking the same thing. then rinse and repeat tomorrow.
992	50935	16834	boxktx	enmgu7e	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	spirit airlines. never again. fuck them. flight from vegas got canceled. they dont even bother trying to put you on another flight, not only that you have to pay extra for the next flight available. i told them they can go fuck themselves and i want a refund, the customer service person told me he can refund me spirit credit, thats when i lost it. after enough bitching, he gave me my money back to my credit card and i bought a flight on delta. edit: thanks for the silver kind person. after my experience i made it a point to go on several review sites and made a psa to never fly spirit again. this was one of many incidents i have had to deal with them, this one just broke me because i was flying back from vegas, i can only handle vegas for 2 nights, after that i want the fuck outta there, having to stay there another night was not something i wanted to do. also it was not weather related as they told me, no other flights into detroit that day were cancelled, i checked, i even told that to the customer service agent, he shrugged it off.
993	50935	7289	boxktx	enmcw7v	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	lularoe. i only bought stuff to help out a friend that was trying to make ends meet. luckily she quit after about a year. bought 3 pairs of leggings over the course of the year and none of them made it the year without holes. $25 each. never again. also, i felt gross buying from an mlm, but like i said, just supporting a friend.
994	50935	3012	boxktx	enmjvmi	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	at&t. i was told that canceling my cable and internet services with them would cost me $50 to not return the modem and cable boxes. i didnt care, as i wouldve had to mail them in and didnt want to mess with the hassle, so i didnt. 6 months later i find a $487 charge on my mastercard and it was from at&t. it was $150 per piece of equipment, and a $37 service charge (you know, charging me money for their hassle of having to charge me money). i asked if i returned the equipment would they rescind the charges, they said yes, i returned the equipment and they refused to take off the charge. i confirmed with them that they received the equipment and they said yes they did, but wouldnt rescind the charges after all. i fought it up their chain of command as much as possible and even tried to fight it through mastercard but they couldnt do anything about it either. tl;dr at&t screwed me out of $487, and lied to me, so fuck them.
995	50935	20135	boxktx	enm69hd	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	fucking at&t it's one thing after another with these assholes. they've been taking 60$ a month from my checking account for the last seven months for a prepaid phone that i don't have they can't tell me why or take me off auto draft because i don't have a phone number to look up the phone that i dont own. just spent almost an hour at the bank trying to dispute this shit. it's just the most recent in a long list of fuckery caused by at&t. those twats.
996	50935	11205	boxktx	enmyxdn	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	comcast. fuck comcast. they failed to turn off my service when i changed addresses, billed me for two more months, sent me to collections, and harassed me for 3 years. i could sue but its not worth the stress. edit: holy crap my inbox- additional info: i called them about this more than a dozen times and every time escalated the situation. they have dozens of tapes of us (albeit a few of them i am absolutely freaking out about the whole thing on the phone). my best experience was when i called their corporate office directly, but even then it was a shitshow and like a week before anything happened, and i was still being harassed by collection companies somehow. never again.

"wayfair. delivered a wooden table that had a huge split on the side and was broken where you put the leaf to extend the table. got four redeliveries and ever single time it was the exact same table with the same damage. eventually got a full refund but did they seriously think that would work? makes 0 sense to me. bonus: ordered a bedroom set around the same time and paid for delivery and assembly. the ""assemblers"" were 2/3 through the assembly and told me they couldn't finish because they couldn't understand the instructions. had them take all the stuff back and also got a refund."
998	50935	3577	boxktx	enobzuj	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	neiman marcus. i went there to buy a prada bag for my mother. she had a knock off she loved, so i figured shed appreciate the real thing. i wear t-shirts to work, but this day it was at least a fancy one. it didnt matter. the sales lady told me its very expensive, rolled her eyes and walked away. so, i went next door to the actual prada store and bought one. i dont need to be judged by an angry middle aged woman working retail, thank you very much.
999	50935	11932	boxktx	enmk04y	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	turbo tax. did my return, got a notice that my e-file needed to be corrected, logged back in to fix it and my return wasnt there anymore. 6 hours on the phone with 3 tiers of tech support, each one trying exactly the same thing. finally they were just trying random shit, so i tried random shit in parallel, managed to get to my return with the invoice number from paying for the service without logging in. tried to get them to understand that this was a very bad thing that they should report to someone. and they told me they had no access to anyone technical and no way to submit bugs. this from the company that lobbied to make it illegal for the government to offer tax filing service.

"there is a ""burger"" joint here, relatively new (less than 5 years) that some people swear by. it's a weird kind of burger though, a kind of spicey gravy style burger. but not like your gran's gravy, it's rather.tangy? vingery? whatever. it was odd. so i tried it on my lunch break (recommended by a co-worker), and thought.meh, i don't get the hype, but it's not terrible. then i went back to work, and shortly thereafter all hell broke lose. i had the most volatile, violent, unsolicited and certainly nonconsensual colon cleanse of my life. i was so obviously tore up that not even my manager made a stink about me essentially doing zero work for the next 4 hours of the work day. to this day when i pass by that place i say ""never again."" my wife think's i'm making a stupid dad joke i won't give up on (shes aware of what it did to me), but for me it's more of a solemn prayer. edit: ""to do this"" changed to ""to this day"". not sure how i typo'd that. edit 2: ok fine. company name is mojo's caf. local business, hence the hesitancy to just outright say it. but there you have it."
1001	50935	2884	boxktx	enniwni	"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	a hospital in my area. my brother and his wife just recently had a baby there. my first nephew and their first child. he was born two weeks premature by scheduled c-section, but you couldnt tell since he was more than 9 pounds when he came out. if he went full term he could have been more than 11 pounds. anyways, he arrives and everything is going well, his blood sugar was a little low, but the doctors claimed it got better. a day later and he begins twitching every once in a while. my sister in law asks the pediatrician and the nurse why and they said that it was fine. the day after that and the twitching increased and he began doing it every other minute. my brother and his wife panic and ask the doctor but the doctor checks his blood quickly and says nothing is wrong but if theyre still worried about it they should wait to go to the pediatrician on monday (3 days later). as soon as they leave the hospital despite the baby still twitching they turn around and ask for the doctor to please look one more time. he refuses and tells them that they cant look anymore because they are discharged from the hospital. refusing to believe that their baby was okay, my brother and his wife took him to a different hospitals emergency room. the doctor there took one look at the babys blood and immediately prepared a bottle of formula for him. his blood sugar was 36. if you arent familiar with blood sugar then just know that sugar that low can be deadly. my sister in laws milk hasnt come in yet, she didnt know that, and the pediatrician at the first hospital only gave the baby 2 ounces of formula in 2 days. he baby was very close to going into shock. if they took the doctors advice and waited until monday that baby would have been dead before reaching home. edit: my sister in law was checked many times for gestational diabetes and she didnt have it at any point. the hospital is in pennsylvania but i wont name which one at least until my brother and sister in law decide to sue or not. i and most of my family agree that they should sue but theyre much more focused on their new baby at the moment. the baby is fine now and getting fed plenty at home with a mixture of both breast milk and formula.

(edit: for the people who can't gather this from context, that was unusual. all the times i'd gone to the bar before, i got itemized receipts. all of my friends that night got itemized receipts when they closed out.) i spent 20 minutes, on my birthday, at the bar, calling out the bartender's name, asking for an itemized receipt, while he pretended he could neither see nor hear me. i went home and reached out to management and explained the story to them, including how long i tried to get his attention. her reply: ""if you thought there was an issue with your receipt, you should have asked the bartender to explain it to you."" never again. case anyone cares, it's penn social in dc. edit: since this seems to be coming up a lot: this is america, so not ""chip and pin"". they won't serve you unless they first swipe your credit card. i could not simply ""leave without paying"", it was going to be charged to me no matter what. my experience with disputing charges is that it's not super convenient, so i was really hoping to be able to deal with this at the bar without having to do that. so please don't be one of the 337 people who have told me ""i would have just left."" edit: thank you for the silver, kind stranger. if anyone else wants to do the same, please donate the money to a charity instead, or just give it to a homeless person."
