7832	20186	148	bk8ypo	emez97a	gamers of reddit: what video game are you currently playing?	"fell down the rabbit hole of a diablo 2 overhaul mod called median xl. it's completely free and they scrapped/rebuilt every ability in the game, the level cap is 150 (you level faster), and there are new areas, bosses, mobs, items, sets, gems, runes. plus a poe-like crafting system. the graphics are a little better, but still ""dated"". i highly recommend you at least watch a gameplay video if you're interested!"

7837	20186	110	bk8ypo	emewf7r	gamers of reddit: what video game are you currently playing?	uboat it is pretty laid-back (at least to me anyway) wwii submarine game where you hunt cargo ships and warships. you manage your crew and research new tech to add onto your sub once you get enough credits from sinking ships and doing missions. it just released on early access on steam, so there is some bugs they need to work out. within 24 hours, they fixed some major stuff like not being able to save the game. the only gripe i have is that i don't know what some of the parts on the sub actually do and random crashes. it is pretty fun.
7838	20186	386	bk8ypo	emeyr6b	gamers of reddit: what video game are you currently playing?	overwatch, especially now that custom games have taken a turn.

7843	20186	78	bk8ypo	emf37ud	gamers of reddit: what video game are you currently playing?	currently re-playing persona 5. its an interesting experience playing it the second time around. i skip most of the dialogue, im far more efficient with leveling social stats and confidants, im far better at combat and the like, i just generally have my shit together. it got to the point where i decided to make the ulitimate nigh-unkillable yoshitsune just for fun (null or repels every element except fire, which its resistant to, and gunfire, which is rare). its stupidly expensive to make, but im now willing to grind for an hour or so after finishing a palace in order to fuse the necessary ingredient personas. ive currently saved up 1.5 million yen and am just waiting to max out the magician confidant so i can make futsunuji(?) which is the last one i need before i can start the final fusion process. it took an absurd amount of effort to accomplish and will make the rest of the game (and new game +, probably) trivial, but damn if it isnt satisfying to see the pieces come together.
