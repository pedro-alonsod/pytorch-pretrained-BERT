4549	35022	5668	bpw8r2	enyftyk	if you could keep any animal as a pet and it would be 100% friendly and loyal, what animal would you pick?	"let's think about this realistically. the title stipulates the animal be ""100% friendly and loyal,"" which is assumed only to extend to you, the owner. we'll also assume op meant the animal was automatically domesticated to a reasonable extent. however op doesn't mention any secondary attributes of the animal - here are some criteria we must consider before making this fateful decision. is the animal territorial? prone to attacking others? is the animal mentally dependent on social structures? does the animal require a specific diet/large amounts of food? does the animal have a penchant for marking territory with offensive bodily odors? what is the animal's circadian cycle? does the animal exist? (looking at you, dragon people) does the animal require a specific climate/environment? can the animal adapt to confinement? does the animal enjoy destroying your house? (looking at you, tickles) does the animal shed? does the animal hibernate? is the animal's disposition affected by the biological prerogative? does the animal urinate/defecate without discretion? does the animal have behavioral triggers incompatible with modernity? therefore, looking at the criteria, we can confidently conclude that the only reasonable choice is. **drumroll*\* **a polar bear** because fuck it; it's a goddam polar bear."

4563	35022	74	bpw8r2	enyzw2d	if you could keep any animal as a pet and it would be 100% friendly and loyal, what animal would you pick?	"eagle golden or bald, doesn't matter to me. both are awesome. (edit4: for the record, i'm 99% sure having a bald eagle as a pet in the us is illegal, unsure about a golden eagle.) absolutely no doubt a freaking eagle (if an elephant is not available). i mentioned this in the elephant comment above, but i was surprised no one mentioned it below. * 30-40 useful year lifespan (in captivity, in the wild normal lifespan is 15-20 years, oldest found in the wild was 32 years old), but can continue living for years to come with my help. (after that timespan they lose the ability to hunt effectively and flying becomes more taxing, but the can still live with help.) * eagle therefore badass * eagle vision can find things that i can't see * eagle vision can lead me on hikes and or help with search and rescue * eagle can hunt for me if i get hurt in wilderness. * eagles are regal af * eagle can retrieve any lost balls/frisbees on roofs * eagle would take awesome go pro footage. ""oh you have a drone, yeah that's old school, i have an eagle, it lasts all day."" edit: it could also be my source of income. falconers at airports make a good deal of money chasing away birds, similar jobs exist everywhere and are very specialized. edit2: as for limiting a beautiful bird from exploring, absolutely not. since the eagle would be 100% loyal to me, (and i would assume we would have some sort of understanding), i could simple tell it to go off and do what it needs to do, and come back when it's done. being 100% loyal, it absolutely would. hopefully, it would choose to nest on my property, and teach its children to also trust me, therefore i'd have an entire brood of loyal eagles. muhahahaha"

"siberian tiger. i'd totally bring him to work on those fridays when you can bring your dog in, and i'd call him ""george"" and i would teach him to aggressively snuggle people without actually hurting them, just to watch them scream. and we would drive around in a convertible, having adventures and shit, and then someday when the law caught up with us, we'd drive over a cliff and everything would fade to white because we'd have had some miraculous epiphany where everything made sense, and the closing credits would have uplifting music and shit, with like pianos and cellos, and then, at the end of the credits, there'd be a scene with a tiger's paw picking up a set of bmw keys off of an old kitchen table, and the first three notes of the theme would play again, slowly, before everything fades to black."
