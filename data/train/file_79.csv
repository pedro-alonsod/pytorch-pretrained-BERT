548	54062	6561	bu1s5i	ep6j4ci	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	not my current field, but when i worked at starbucks not a lot of people understood that a larger espresso drink does not always = more caffeine. a tall drink has 1 shot, grande has 2, and a venti also has 2, unless its iced and then it gets a 3rd shot. so many times customers would order a grande latte and say you know what, youd better make that a venti, i can use the extra caffeine when in fact the larger size is just more diluted with milk. if you are looking for more caffeine, a drip coffee is going to be the most bang for your buck. also, this seems really obvious, but a lot of people would get upset when they ordered a flavored coffee and saw that i would put syrup in it. no, coffee beans do not naturally come in caramel, vanilla, toffee nut, raspberry etc. flavor.
549	54062	12143	bu1s5i	ep6uoy4	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	the best treatment for a child with anxiety is treating their parents anxiety. edit: thanks for the awards, kind strangers! for those curious, i am a licensed mental health professional that specializes in children. i appreciate that some people noted that anxiety is a necessary a healthy reaction that all people experience, very true! worries help keep us safe and let us know when there is danger. its the worries that interfere with daily functioning that become an issue. i think of anxiety issues on a spectrum, on one end is a healthy dose and on the other is a diagnosable anxiety disorder. there are people all across that spectrum that would benefit from therapy and/or learning some adaptive strategies. as some have pointed out, a childs anxiety is not 100% a result of a parents anxiety. there are, of course, cases where a child develops anxiety due to other circumstances. however, in the majority of cases with anxiety in children, it can be treated by treating the parent. children look to their parents for guidance to learn about what is and isnt safe. they are sponges that are constantly learning how to react to different things they approach. one of the easiest examples to see this is when a child experiences a minor injury/scare, they will naturally look to a trusted adult to judge how they should react. if the adult gasps, comes running with their arms extended, making a worried face, the child learns that was bad and they should be upset/hurt/scared. if the parent was to smile, shrug, and say oh man! the child will likely brush it off and move on (unless they acquired an injury, of course). think about this on a bigger scale, if a child is consistently learning the world is a scary and dangerous place, there are threats everywhere, etc. they are being set-up for anxiety issues. same goes for specific phobias, many of these are directly taught to children by seeing their parents fear. nothing says to be afraid of something more than the person you rely on for your survival showing their own genuine fear. simply following up with children regarding a scary or uncomfortable experience can make a world of difference! if you can inform them of what made that specific experience dangerous or scary, that helps teach them what to look out for instead of generalizing that fear to any experience that involves the same factors. one common example is childrens fear of bugs. the children have never had a bad experience with bugs, but the fact their parent runs away screaming from them each time she has an encounter, is a pretty clear message to them that they are not safe to be around. nothing like the person you trust most in this world expressing panic to discourage you from even getting close to them, especially when she tried reinforces your anxious reactions by holding you and crying with you after you nearly escape death by a caterpillar!

552	54062	1531	bu1s5i	ep6yh83	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	i'm a lifeguard so nothing special, but while training to be one i learned that nearly no drowning victims ever wake back up. they usually die. cpr only has a 10% success rate and even then the chance that they will be a veggie for the rest of their life is something like 80%. so in reality you have about a 2% chance of ever being normal again if you drown. moral of this story is. wear the life jacket if told to and stop arguing with the lifeguards about how your child is a fish.

557	54062	23866	bu1s5i	ep6a5h9	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	"in some museums, what you see on the shelves can be less than 10% of the whole collection. for example, the louvre has over 460,000 items in their collection, and only has space to display about 35,000 of those (roughly 7.6% of their total collection) due to limited physical space, and for aesthetic purposes, most items in museums stay back in storage and/or archives. plus, most items need to be maintained at certain temperatures, and light. if we can't meet those needs, it will never be allowed for public viewing, ever. there are most likely some of the most amazing, visually stunning pieces of artwork, that you or anyone will never get to see. bonus: accession and de-accession can also be a touchy area. just because it's ""old"", doesn't mean we're going to take it and add it to the collections and we try to be nice to people who are disappointed we won't take their precious family heirlooms. other times, it's easier just to say, ""yeah, we don't want that."" **edited:** for correct percentage of the louvre's collection (its lower than i thought!) **edited again:** for those who were asking, i have a ba in art history, and a masters in museum studies. i presently work as a digital preservation librarian in the archives & special collections of a university, and have worked in numerous museums/universities all over the world! its been quite a fulfilling job, i've handled artwork from michelangelo, rembrandt, warhol, pollock, picasso, and many more. ask away, and i'll answer if i can!"
558	54062	4712	bu1s5i	ep67n9t	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	all processors begin as top of the line and then may end up lower because they didn't make the threshold. explaining with an example. <edit> the following is only an example to make things a bit oversimplified and not the actual specs or the actual names. </edit> intel only tries to make i9 processors, let's say they have 16 cores, since the process of making these is hard only 20-30% have all cores working. next they see the amount processors with more than or equal to 8 cores, disable extra cores just to make sure only 8 cores work and ship them as i7. next 4,5,6 and 7 in all only 4 cores are left working and shipped as i5. 2&3 only 2 cores are left operating and all others are switched off, shipped as i3. hope that makes sense, also this was a hypothetical example, not all facts maybe accurate (they should be but just in case) also this is done to minimise wastage which in turn makes these things cheaper so it's a win win for all. also this isn't just done by intel, snapdragon amd all do it, so when you hear nvidia is unable to meet the supply of their top tier card, it's not because the didn't try hard enough, it is because they keep failing to reach the benchmarks they expect in their top tier cards and sell them as low tier, because the yeild is low. note: this is a very difficult process and checking for mistakes in each peice at 14nm is not possible (since verification is a destructive process) so if something is wrong generally a batch gets screwed. edit: thanks for the silver, my first silver. important edit: this is a bit oversimplified, low end processors are also made, but they require setting up an entire assembly line, and thus are only done if there is a high demand and a very high probability of significantly better yield. also cores are not just the only parts disabled.

"put very simply, nuclear power plants generate electricity by boiling water. edit: oh, and the ""smoke"" coming from the cooling tower is just steam, and it isn't radioactive also edit: agreed that if it was indeed smoke coming from a reactor it would indicate a huge problem and you should run away very fast. the smoke wouldn't be coming from the tall cooling towers though, those are usually some distance from the reactor containment building, and there isn't anything in there that's radioactive or that can catch fire. very important note if you see smoke rising from a reactor though, if possible, run upwind and keep going. also also edit: another fun fact for your chernobyl watchers, if you were exposed to 10k roentgen, you'd be in a coma in less than ten seconds."

"about the judicial system (from a court reporter): voice recognition is nowhere near being able to help with court reporting (unless one person is reciting everything into a microphone perfectly, which is a form of court reporting called voice writing, and even then it needs heavy editing). language in general, especially clearly written language, is an artform. also, juries don't have anywhere near the amount of evidence before them that the media may have on a particular case. tons of things are precluded because they're too prejudicial or for a slew of other reasons. i just did a bank robbery case where the guy had 11 prior bank robbery convictions, and the jury wasn't allowed to know that. so don't jump to conclusions about what might have been an ""obviously wrong"" verdict. prosecutors and judges are not on the same team. the judge has no control over how aggressively the prosecution tries their case or what kinds of sentencing they go for. public defenders do amazing work and are paid $100 an hour in my state, so it's not like a minimum wage job; and they get to choose which cases they accept, so it's not like there are just three guys who get all the cases dumped on them. and they can do private practice concurrently. a ton of sex offenders have severe developmental delays and don't understand that what they're doing is wrong. putting them in maximum security prison makes their behavior worse because it's like letting a five-year-old be raised by a bunch of violent adults. there should be gentler rehabilitation centers and more humane confinement for them, imho. ""civil commitment for an indefinite period"" like we have in my state is basically a life sentence in a hardcore correctional facility. dcf can take kids away from really loving parents if it took the parents too long to get their sh\*t together after addiciton. the contingencies they place on parents during recovery are draconian and lapses are forbidden, even though they're a known part of rehabilitation. imagine losing your child because you chose to order a beer with dinner."
