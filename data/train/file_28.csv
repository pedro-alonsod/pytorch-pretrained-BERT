"i was in the emergency room with kidney stones (didn't know it was kidney stones at the time, just knew i was in the most pain i'd ever been in). she got pissed because ""you're not paying attention to me."" seriously, i'm in a fucking emergency room hooked up to an iv with pain killers flowing through me, at this point i'm half conscious cuz of the morphine, & apparently i'm a piece of shit for not paying attention to her. it came to a head when i asked her to get a nurse because something didn't feel right (they had gave me something i was allergic to & i was starting to have an allergic reaction). she said, ""fine, i'll just be your babysitter."" at that point i just told her to go home, that her negativity was making me feel worse. she got all pissy, threw a fit, and left in a rage. next day i didn't even call her for a ride back home when i got out of the hospital, i called my aunt & had her drive me home. the moment i got home i started packing my shit. if you have to be the center of attention & can't feel any empathy whatsoever while i'm in the goddamn emergency room, you're a garbage human i don't want anything to do with."

6597	27636	2074	buz6lq	epk5l9z	why is your ex an ex?	we dated for about 6 years, and i thought things were going quite well. when we started dating, she thought she was asexual and so sex wasn't really a main focus in our relationship, which wasn't a dealbreaker for me so i rolled with it. about a month or two before we broke up, i could feel some distance being forged between us. at first i chalked it up to her being busy with a new job and family obligations - but more and more she would reference one of her coworkers. i'd be lying if i said it didn't bother me, but i trusted her completely, so i didn't tell her not to talk to him or anything, and she reassured me that there was nothing going on between them. well, one night we're talking over messenger and our conversation took a pretty serious turn where she basically admitted to me that she didn't think she was as asexual as she thought she was, and that she didn't find me appealing in that way at all. it devastated me, but i ultimately accepted it. naturally, i asked if her coworker had any role in her decision to breakup, which she was adamant that he didn't. not even two weeks later, i find out that the two of them started dating, which *really* made me go into a deep depression. i'm happy to say that it's been a little over a year since then, and i've lost over 130 pounds (and am finally at a healthy weight for the first time in my adult life), my social life is the best it's ever been, i got my degree, and have an excellent new job. at one point i thought my life was over, and in some regards, i was right - my life as i had known it *was* over - but my new life is so much better.

6606	27636	2558	buz6lq	epjr8po	why is your ex an ex?	this was the worst one. we were in a long distance relationship. it wasn't working out for him though so he broke up with me. we still kept daily contact however. when he came back to visit (my city is his home), he told me that he missed me and so we hung out the entire week he was there, had sex and all that. i was pretty sure we were going to make it work and get back together (that's what i was hoping) turns out, when he went back to his other country, i found out by luck that he was actually in a relationship with another girl. so yeah. he cheated on her with me. the best part? this was a girl that i had some red flags up on when we were still together and he was actually dating her while we were still together. yup. felt like a complete idiot and that's how he became my ex forever.

6622	27636	2708	buz6lq	epjqms4	why is your ex an ex?	not really an ex but someone i dated for a month or two. started talking about marriage and having kids after the third or fourth date. would call me in the middle of the night because she needed help with something that any fully functional adult should be able to do by themselves, i.e. stuff like lifting a 10 lbs object from the floor and placing it on a counter. finally broke it off when she told me i'm gonna have to cut any and all ties to one of my best friends because i'm not allowed to talk to other girls now that we're dating. &#x200b; she ended up stalking me for like six months, threatened to a) kill me in my sleep or b) walk up to the police and tell them i had raped her (glad she typed that out in detail so i could just easily screencap everything in case i ever needed the evidence), called me at 4 am multiple times after getting shitfaced at a bar and when i'd switch my phone off, she'd send me 80+ messages that usually evolved from trying to guilt trip me to take her back into borderline psychotic ranting and empty threats. she eventually fucked some old dude, got an std, and claimed it was my fault because i had forced her to do that by not wanting to be with her. &#x200b; so that was fun while it lasted.
6623	27636	7123	buz6lq	epjql16	why is your ex an ex?	he didn't feel as strongly about me as i did about him. and he didn't care about how i felt during sex. eta: surprised that this comment blew up! wanted to clarify that i am a woman and that the main sex issue was that i need time to work up to comfortably putting his manly bit into my lady bits. i did communicate this to him and we had what i thought was very satisfying sex several times after that, despite him having a bit of attitude of this again? whenever i wasnt immediately ready to be jackhammered after a minute of making out. he told me in the aftermath of our relationship that he thought our physical relationship was completely unenjoyable. there were other things too that he did that made it clear to me that he didnt care how i felt during sex like often wanting oral but never giving it and needing reminders to put on a condom despite the fact that i wasnt on birth control for part of the relationship.

6627	27636	145	buz6lq	epjt3g1	why is your ex an ex?	i knew him for about 3 months and he wanted to know when he could ask my dad to marry me (he thought 6months of dating would be good) and he had our whole life planned out. we were both only 17 at the time. now he just shit talks me on twitter months after we broke up.
6628	27636	9235	buz6lq	epjkmik	why is your ex an ex?	he punched me in the face after a petty argument. edit: firstly, it doesn't matter what the argument was about. you don't abuse your partner. secondly, i'm a guy too. violence amongst gay couples is a silent issue that's rarely ever talked about and in my experience with friends it can be pretty damn ugly too. thirdly, i'm not a violent person. however he did more than punch me after it when following me home and i hit him when he went to strangle me. it did nothing though as i'm soft as shit. fourthly, i am okay thank you. love and light

6631	27636	15178	buz6lq	epjrqg3	why is your ex an ex?	"he had a sneeze fetish that he obsessed unhealthily over. in my sleep he'd ball up cat hair and try to put it into my nose. i didn't know he was doing this to me until i had a nasty sinus infection and had my sinus flooded out at urgent care. out came small balls of cat hair. the final straw was cheating on me with a girl who had a bigger nose than me. she was his ex and he just couldn't get over that nose dedpite the fact she was literally psychotic. they were perfect for eachother. not my loss. but my mistake ever trying to be tolerant and understanding of him. makes great material for the biography i'll never write. edit:i'm new to reddit and didn't expect this to blow up haha. for more context i suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. (doing much better now that my insurance actually covers the meds!) and he took advantage of the frequent opportunities. i hadnt noticed but suddenly there was a searing pain and one of my sinus got very puffy. i had taken a couple days off work and eventually went to urgent care where they did the flush. (it was my second time going back there desperate for help) when the two very small balls came out neither the doc or i knew what the fuck it was. doc worried it was a mold of sorts until he broke one apart in his hand and could tell it was small black strands of hair. i was confused and it didn't click until on the cab ride home what it was from. i confronted him which didnt get very far (wrote about that in another comment.) still had lingering pain but it wasnt nearly as bad after. i understand this is hard to believe but at the very least you can confirm the fetish is real with a simple search. sorry for typos, i suck at texting on my phone. edit again: it's perfectly okay to laugh. myself laughing at this is how i coped through it at the time. in the moment i was devastated, totally emotionally wrecked and confused at pretty much every aspect of it. but my friends were great and like ""*dude. what if you had a child and she sneezed? nothing would ever be normal.*"" and they helped me laugh through it all."
6632	27636	13941	buz6lq	epjgztx	why is your ex an ex?	because we were two different people in two different places in our life. also bc she had a nasty habit of banging my friends, but that's besides the point.
6633	27636	8621	buz6lq	epjzzpl	why is your ex an ex?	"he threatened suicide every few weeks. he constantly performed ""tests"" on me to see if i loved him enough or that i could be trusted. i *always* failed them. he would demand i stay up on the phone almost every night until 1am or later listening, not talking, to him. i would be expected to stay awake and listen to his rambling anecdotes for hours silently. if i spoke, i'd make him lose his train of thought. if i fell asleep, i got screamed at or a day of the cold shoulder. these are just a few examples. i was a young teenager who got sucked into a cycle of psychological abuse for a few years. i'm fine now for the most part. edit: to those replying that they've been through this too, i'm sorry. edit 2: i'm working through replies to this, and i'm noticing a lot of people are getting a downvote or two. it seems to be the comments which start with some variant of ""wow did we date the same person?"". whoever is doing this, stop it. i don't like it. these people experienced a similar situation, and they deserve the same respect my own post has received."
6634	27636	4985	buz6lq	epjjec5	why is your ex an ex?	because i started using heroin and she cheated. edit: thanks for your support everyone, i know an ex junkie talking about a break up isn't the funniest thing to listen to. edit 2: thanks for the 2 gold and platinum kind strangers
6635	27636	20867	buz6lq	epjq6dw	why is your ex an ex?	it was mutual after a couple big discussions. i wanted to travel, she didn't. i don't want to have children, and she did. i didn't want her fucking her ex, but she did. gotta decide on what your dealbreakers are, i guess.
6636	27636	472	buz6lq	epjr564	why is your ex an ex?	he ended up being crazier than i initially wanted to believe. years of stalking after our break-up really did turn me into a paranoid freak. but in time i am doing a lot better. lesson learned.
6637	27636	558	buz6lq	epjzeec	why is your ex an ex?	he thought people finding out he was dating an asian-american would be embarrassing. so bullet dodged but i wish i could say i was the one who decided that.
6638	27636	21296	buz6lq	epjws38	why is your ex an ex?	because i could predict the entirety of the rest of my life and i didn't like it. i would have taken over the family bakery and spent every day waking up at 3 am to make donuts. 9 am would be the start time for sausages. leave the bakery @ 4 pm.deposit the daily sales before the bank closes. drive home and eat the unsold sausages for dinner. watch tv for 1.5 hours before falling asleep in a chair. wake up at 3 am. repeat. forever. there was no joy in her father's eyes. joy left years ago.
6639	27636	1191	buz6lq	epjwn6b	why is your ex an ex?	an 8-year lasagna of me being noticeably depressed, me not making continuous romantic gestures, a long-term sense of complacency on both our parts and both of us gravitating towards opposite directions in life. i dated her for almost a decade (im 25), and our time together made me a better person. im grateful for the time we shared and dont regret it, but ive made my peace and spent nearly 2 years swallowing that bitter, gargantuan pill. i wish her the best and view her in warm regard, but i dont want to be her friend or even cross paths with her ever again. getting over the breakup had to be the hardest thing ive ever done, and picking that scab just to keep up the meaningless platitude of we can still be friends would be a waste of both of our time.
6640	27636	120	buz6lq	epk6fjl	why is your ex an ex?	cause i was an insecure asshole who only worried about myself. one of the biggest fuck ups of my life. really let a good one go
6641	27636	683	buz6lq	epk5izd	why is your ex an ex?	stuck in a house with him for four years, somehow got issolated and seperated from everyone i knew. couldnt leave the house out of fear. heard him talking in at least four different personalities to himself. threated rape if i didn't sexually do what he wanted. then turned around and claimed he hadnt said that, that i was confused. killed my pet rat. duct taped my dogs face closed, took pictures and laughed with his friends. finially lied through my teeth to get him out of the house long enough to leave him. got stalked for three years. cut my break lines. i eventually moved states, five times. guess im safe now edit: didnt think this would get so much response. if anyone is concerned and needs help identifiying red flags, or needs advice if they know they're in it and are terrified to get out you can message me seperatly if you'd like. that being said i know its not easy to bring up to anyone, but sometimes its the easiest talking to a stranger.
6642	27636	2718	buz6lq	epjp8c0	why is your ex an ex?	she pushed me to reveal my secrets then used them to manipulate me. for some reason, she thought her vagina was enough to keep me around and all she needed to bring to the table. bye ho.

6645	27636	215	buz6lq	epk3eej	why is your ex an ex?	she was the right person for me. i wasnt the right person for her. and just when we started to get really serious, my mental health took a serious nose dive that neither of us were expecting. she knew what i struggled with. but even i didnt know i could get as bad as i did then. despite being madly in love with her, i ended up in a dark place. she decided she didnt want to put up with that. i dont blame her. but its been hard.
6646	27636	1935	buz6lq	epjt9nu	why is your ex an ex?	she left for another guy. she broke up with me in civilised manner. she said there is a guy at her uni she is really into and she doesn't feel the spark between us anymore. i was glad she was open with me instead of just cheating. this guy rejected her advances and she tried to get back with me. well, you said its over - its over. she's been single for a few years now, hehe. an i met an amazing new partner soon after the break up
6647	27636	1232	buz6lq	epjrpvk	why is your ex an ex?	he put his family (and specifically his toxic mother) before me, even over stuff where it wouldn't hurt them to put me first but it did hurt me intensely to put me second. we were married and had been together over a decade. when i finally asserted myself and put my foot down because i was tired of suffering from his lack of care and demonstration of care for me, he began to physically abuse me out of frustration. the day he choked me i packed my bags and went to a hotel and told him i wanted a divorce. it's been two years now and i am a lot poorer and taking care of our son without a partner living with me, or family nearby is very difficult, but i am much happier in other ways. my new partner is a much more compassionate person.
6648	27636	598	buz6lq	epjr5b1	why is your ex an ex?	after he got chemotherapy he started to take drugs like heroin and cocaine. he completely changed and i couldn't take it anymore. another one beat me and sexually abused me because he thought it would be funny to see me cry. that was his answer when i and a friend of mine who i told this confronted him about that edit 1 : wow that post got more attention than i thought it would. to clarify those were two different relationships. i was 17 when i broke up with the guy who got cancer. he survived the chemotherapy but he is still an heavy drug user. the other one i met when i was 19 years old. thank god i got away fast enough before he could do anything worse to me.

"i'll only give my last two to keep it somewhat concise. the woman before my last ex. well she had the unfortunate timing of being with me when my father/best friend died unexpectedly when i was in my early twenties. while we had been together about 3 years, i said fuck the world and turned into an alcholic and moved 2000 miles away. i actually feel bad for her. queue 6 months into my self destructive path i am sleeping with this girl(on the wrong side of the crazy/hot scale) pretty much daily, but i have made it clear it is a fwb situation and i am not interested in a relationship with her. that didnt work for her. but idgaf so i keep putting my dick in crazy and drinking (hindsight is 20/20). so when i start casually dating another woman on the side 6 months later she(crazy>hot) is pissed and takes it out on my vehicle and with a bout of stalking. that ""other woman"" somehow stuck with me, got me help for my drinking, helped me move past the loss of my father and some moderate ptsd from the military; then became my wife and mothered my children. i dont know what i did to deserve her but she literally saved my life and i'll never be able to repay her."

6662	27636	316	buz6lq	epjvehb	why is your ex an ex?	he was an abusive, drug addicted alcoholic who would drug me and who literally gaslighted me into multiple psychotic breaks. one day, after he shouted at me in front of his friend after i begged him to close the door so his friend wouldnt hear him, i just snapped and screamed and shouted in his face just to fucking stop. and then he was the one that broke up with me, he turned to his friend and said shes a fucking psycho. and that was that. it was my first relationship and it has really done a number on me and how i perceive normal relationships. im still trying to come to terms with it over a year later. edit: i really didnt expect this to get any upvotes or to get the support that i have done. i just want to say thank you very much for all the well wishes!

6665	27636	58	buz6lq	epk2jls	why is your ex an ex?	i had been considering breaking up with her for a while because she would lie about little things that made no sense lying about. never cheated or anything, but would do anything so that she would get more attention from me and other people. i started noticing this when one night she sent me screenshots of her text messages between her and her dad. i had known her dad for a while and the things he was saying in these texts were awful. they were things like youre worthless i wish you werent my daughter they were things he would never ever say. if there was one thing he showed was how much he loved his two daughters. i was kind of skeptical when she sent me these because he would never say that stuff, but obviously i couldnt just come out and tell her i didnt believe her cause if it was true then id be a terrible person. what i thought was happening was i thought she was changing her contact info and texting herself making it seem like it was her dad who was sending that stuff. anyways, this happens a few more times in the next few weeks and im just there for her trying to be a good boyfriend because theres always a chance it could be true. well one weekend she went to a concert with her friend and after the concert she was drunk and we were facetiming and she told me that i was still in love with my ex. immediately im like what are you talking about why do you say that?? and she responds by telling me that i texted my ex telling her i still love her and she has the screenshot. i told her to send it to me and there it was a screenshot of me telling my ex i love her. the problem was that i never sent that and it was obvious she texted herself saying that because she was drunk and wasnt able to type that out correctly. she made it realistic though, because she even went out of her way to use the exact contact picture i had for my ex which was a very unique dumb picture. the moment this happened i knew the screenshots of her dad werent real and i proceeded to say goodnight and break up with her the day she got back. that is why she is my ex.
