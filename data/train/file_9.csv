8110	18697	15256	btm0yy	ep1ceqr	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	not my fuck up necessarily.but i invited a friend over for a bbq. he didnt know anyone and has never been to my house but seemed really eager to go. so i was a little irritated that he was almost 2 hours late. i was just about to text him when i happened to look over my neighbors fence. the neighbor was also having a bbq. it was like it happened in slow motion. i saw my friend in the neighbors yard chatting up some old lady. our eyes locked. i saw the realization literally hit his face. i still laugh about it. i swear the guy turned white!

"was at a bar, chatting with some friends. my gf was across the room sitting with some other friends. some drunk dude showed up and started groping her. i jumped up, pushed him away and yelled ""fuck off."" then he turned around and i realized he was like twice my size.and not in the fat way.in the tall muscular way. i mean i did the right thing, but if the bartender hadn't leapt over the bar and jumped in between us immediately that guy would have wiped the fucking floor with me. the moment the dude turned around i thought ""fuck, this is gonna hurt."""
8128	18697	2138	btm0yy	ep00fi6	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i was a young software engineer working for a startup in 1998. wrote about a weeks worth of code, images, and html. there was this funny file named ?~ in the directory. i wasnt sure how it got there, but i wanted it gone before i checked everything into cvs. no problem. rm-rf ?*. i discovered my error a few seconds later when the directory listing contained nothing. no code, images, or html. turns out ? is a shell wildcard character matching any 1 character. combined with * all files got deleted. it was at this moment i knew i fucked up. luckily i was using linux. e2fs file systems had a utility called debugfs which allowed me to list deleted inodes and dump them to new files. took the better part of a day to figure it all out since this was before google. i recovered the entire project.
8129	18697	2369	btm0yy	eozx756	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	here is good one which happened last week. i had a little too much beer and passed out at around 2am. it was couple of hours after i woke up and had this feeling to take a shit but at the same time i felt like throwing up. as i run towards washroom i thought definitely i'm gonna throw up but nothing came out. i was waiting on all four when i decided it's time to take a shit. big fuckin mistake. half way through i realised i fucked up. vomited all over the floor and on my legs. worse part is i had to sit there 10 more minutes in that puddle while i finish pooping.

8131	18697	5604	btm0yy	eozw13s	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i've told this story before, but i had invited this guy over to my place for dinner after we'd been casually seeing each other for three weeks or so. things were going pretty well -- we were chatting, getting along like a house on fire, and he was helping me cook dinner -- when i started to feel *extremely* intestinally unwell. i've always been kind of a private pooper, and i could tell that this one wasn't going to be fun, so i asked him if he'd pop down to the shop at the end of the road to grab a bottle of wine for dinner. he agreed, and toddled off down the street, and as soon as he was gone i *raced* to the bathroom and relieved myself with something roughly akin to the force of a. well, imagine [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/), but in reverse. i took a minute to catch my breath, reached over to the toilet roll holder, and came back empty. *well, shit.* no matter. i had a full 9-pack of toilet paper in the back room -- i didn't have space to keep it in my tiny bathroom; it was a very small apartment, so i usually just grabbed a roll or two -- and he'd only just gone. i had plenty of time. cut to me, thirty seconds later, pants around my ankles and my shit-caked bunghole shimmying my way down the central hallway of my flat when i hear a still, small voice from behind me. &nbsp; ^^^'erm. ^^^*what* ^^^are ^^^you ^^^doing?' turns out he'd managed to get to the shop and back in record time, and was sitting on my couch in my living room with a perfect, *perfect* view of my little faecal burlesque. i was framed in the doorway like a goddamn renaissance painting. it was as though i was presenting myself to him in the worst possible *you like?* come-on in the history of dating. it's very difficult to have a civilised dinner after that.
8132	18697	1637	btm0yy	ep023ts	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	going on a long hike while in the marines. realized i fucked up when i saw my first sergeant with two rifles and me just recognizing i don't know where mine is. the what happened edit: copious amounts of yelling were had. since i didnt want to carry my rifle, my command figured i didnt have to carry any of my other shit either. i had to divvy up my pack among my squad mates and i rode in the truck the whole way back so i didnt hurt my precious feet (or something like that). my fellow marines sorted me out real quick. i felt like the ultimate shit bird. being stuck on duty in my service uniform for the next 24 hours yelling my general orders didnt help.

8143	18697	2493	btm0yy	eozzmue	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	new year's eve 1999 i called a woman i was very good friends with (friends only, i was firmly in the friend zone at that time), she was also my boss. i had way too much to drink and was not in any way considered sober or even slightly so, i was pissed as a fart. i proceeded to tell this woman how i felt about her, what i wished to do with her and how i wanted to do it. i told her this for about 45 minutes. afterwards i continued to drink. several days later back at work she calls me into the office and asked me why i'd called her at new year, i pulled a blank, i honestly could not remember a thing. she also informed me that several minutes into the conversation/monologue she handed the phone over to her mother. i still pulled a blank, in fact i was so convinced that nothing happened i was sure she was winding me up. if anything like that had happened after all why was she still even talking to me let alone letting me continue to work with her. she insisted that i called and i refused to believe her. it was not until late january when i received my detailed mobile phone bill that showed a 48 minute phone call to her number late on december 31 that i finally had to believe her. the difficult part was facing her mother after my boss and i became an item. we are now very happily married but even now my mil still takes the piss out of me over that phone call. my wife however is very happy. edit- when this message was posted it was the 69th post on this thread - coincidence?
8144	18697	1902	btm0yy	ep0r4a5	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"halloween 2011. 3 men knock on the door all wearing masks. i laugh it off thinking it's some friends being stupid. unlock the door. handle flies down, door gets kicked open (realise i fucked up) and within seconds i've got my hands and feet bound whilst they begin to trash and rob the place. i escaped when my feet got loose, slipped my hands over my skinny butt (thank you high metabolism), ran to a window, opened it, climbed out and jumped from the first floor window. broke a fuck tonne of bones in both feet and sprinted to a neighbors house. i now have fucked knees and feet and ptsd at halloween time. get anxiety when someone knocks on the door regardless of the time of year. got addicted to pain killers for about 7 years and struggle with alcoholism. also really fucking sad that my favourite holiday was ruined. edit: i am indeed from the uk where we use ""ground floor"" first and then the floors begin to be numbered. tldr; let 3 home invaders into my house on halloween resulting in physical and mental health conditions that continue today."
8145	18697	4392	btm0yy	eozqnf7	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"a female friend of mine  to whom i was admittedly attracted  had been expressing her reservations about an upcoming vacation with her family. though it wasn't being overtly presented as such, the trip was meant as a way of re-solidifying her parents' marriage, which had been a touch rocky at the time. they would all be driving from san francisco to redding (which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere in northern california), where they'd stay at a bed-and-breakfast inn for a weekend before continuing northward for some unknown destination. in keeping with the alleged purpose of this so-called vacation, two rooms had been booked at the inn in question. to her dismay, though, my friend discovered that her mother would be occupying one room, her father would have the other, and that she and her sister would each have to bunk with one of their parents. this was worthy of lament on its own, but it was made unforgivably worse by the verbal diarrhea that i offered in an attempt at providing comfort: ""aw, it won't be so bad!"" i told my friend. ""your father will probably enjoy sleeping with you."" a moment passed before i realized what i had said. then, with a feeling of growing horror, i tried to explain myself. ""wait, i didn't mean it like that!"" i hurriedly said. ""i mean, like, he's probably sick of sleeping with your mom. no, wait, i mean. i just mean that he wants to spend some quality time with his daughter."" if i had stopped there, i *might* have been able to salvage the situation. but as it happened, i decided that the best course of action would be to keep talking. ""i can't say that i blame him, really. *i'd* love to sleep with you."" she and i don't talk much these days. **tl;dr: implied incest, mocked mom, failed flirtation.**"

8147	18697	434	btm0yy	ep09kgv	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	so about three years ago, my dad, my dad's girlfriend, my brother and i went cycling around this lake like we do so often. my brother (15 at that time) and i (11 back then) decided to make a race with the finish being a parking lot. at the end of this parking lot was a barrier right before a bridge. it rained that day in the morning and obviously, my brother won by far but i was still going at - what for my age was - a high speed. when i finally got to the finish, i had to slow down, but my bike just wouldn't. that's when i knew i fucked up real bad. i ended up crashing into that barrier and hanging over that shit afterwards. my brother describes this story as so unbelievably funny because my bike was just small enough to fit under the barrier and so it drove on like 10ft, leaving me behind hanging on the barrier. well i hope i made your day a bit better. also, my english isn't perfect, i know. i'm not a native speaker.
8148	18697	279	btm0yy	ep03dbb	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i was playing on the swings when i was about 10 years old, i flew off and somehow smashed my balls and dick on the roundabout, i couldn't even breath, i put my hand down my shorts and when i pulled it back out it was covered in my blood. that was the moment i knew i had fucked up. i told my cousin i needed help and he just run off and ditched me. i limped all the way home and into the kitchen where my family were starting dinner, but the cute girl from next door that i fancied was also sitting there. i told my mum i needed to talk to her in private, my mum is kind of a bitch and kept saying 'just fucking spit it out' that's when i had to tell my mum in front of the girl i fancied while sobbing my eyes out that i had smashed my balls and dick and i was bleeding from either my dick, my sack or both. turned out u had blood ozeing out of my dick hole. that happened 22 years ago and i still think about it to this day.

8153	18697	757	btm0yy	ep0f56x	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	more years ago than i can quite believe (until i catch a glimpse of my grey hair in the mirror) was the last time i drove drunk. it was a summer lunchtime and a handful of us had been partying for several days at a friends (parents) house. i was *wasted*, as was everyone else - so when a female friend turned up in her brand new 4x4 and promptly fell asleep the obvious course of action was for us to borrow the vehicle for a joyride around the lanes of somerset. this was, actually, pretty anomalous for us - drink-driving was always heavily frowned upon - but clearly under the influence of anything and everything it all seemed to make perfect sense. for the next while - i was far too pissed to know how much time was passing - we took turns speeding round the roads in what was effectively a stolen car, drinking and getting (even more) high. my turn came last and everyone was joking about our good fortune running out and us getting nicked/dying in a fiery crash (ha. ha. ha.) - especially with me behind the wheel, as we were quite close to the spot where id been a passenger in a crash the previous year. which was thoroughly reassuring. i settled in and started tearing up the lanes - cant remember what the vehicle was but it was great fun to hoon round in (and a bit different: automatics arent especially common in the uk) - and put on the prodigy for the ideal soundtrack. turning the corner i saw that we were at the start of a long straight (an old roman road leading to glastonbury) ideal for just flooring it - so thats what i did. at the end of the straight i made the turn with, i think, two wheels ever-so-slightly leaving the ground - and ill never forget the definitely discernible shift of mood that caused in all of us, like yeah ok that was a little close. its time to stop this. - just before i saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and my whole world got ready to go down the shitter. i had no idea how long theyd been behind us but even if it was very recent thing they would just have seen us taking the last corner on two wheels. at god knows how much over the speed limit. in a stolen car. very drunk. very high. with no licence, nor insurance. and pockets full of drugs. until then id always thought my blood turned to ice was nonsense but at that instant i understood: i really felt frozen. the car went immediately silent (apart from the siren which we could now hear) as i killed the stereo, trying not to panic, just thinking over and over: im fucked. this is it. im really, truly, totally fucked - and everyone else in the car thinking: hes fucked. totally fucked. thank god its not me. there was nowhere to pull in for what felt like miles so i had plenty of time to dwell on my imminent destruction, and to weigh up the pros and cons of trying to escape them (which wouldnt have happened anyway in that car). outwardly i was totally dispassionate and calm (to the extent that later one of my friends said hed decided i was either a psychopath or a terminator) but internally i was screaming, sobbing and already trying to guess how many years inside i was looking at. finally i saw a place to pull in, and put my indicator on like pulling back the hammer on my suicide. i took a deep breath, made the turn - and the police car just steered wide and sped past us. the lights were to get us to pull over, sure - but only to get out of the way. theyd received a different call. ive never driven drunk again.
8154	18697	290	btm0yy	ep1t45t	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"ive posted this in on reddit before, figured i'd put it here because its one of my favorite stories and it fits. so, my junior year of high school, i was taking a class called ""sci-fi and fantasy"". predictably we read books of said genre. we did readers theater (each person in the class gets assigned a character on a voluntary basis, anytime the character says something, the assigned person would say it aloud, the teacher was the narrator, and roleplay was involved if you choose to) on a couple books, one being ""the hobbit"" by jrr tolkien. so in this chapter of the book, my character, thorin, had maybe one or two lines so i was bored. this was the chapter where the eagles swoop down and save the day from the orcs. as the group was saying goodbye (i forget how the book actually goes in this part to the specifics, please forgive me) to the eagles, my teacher stops and asks the group, ""anyone wanna like to do the eagle part?"" gazes around the entire class and does a double take at me (i'm a fairly outgoing person, especially in that class with roleplaying) so i'm like ""f*ck it. why not right??"" and out of the silence, with zero warning to anyone, i just scream ""cccaaaaaaaaaawwwwwww!"" and did the best eagle screech i could do (it was pretty spectacular, especially for being very much on a whim). everyone stops and looks at each other. now its dead silent. nobody knows what to do, or how to react. so my teacher, pipes up after 5 seconds of pure silence ""ok. does anyone wanna do the actual eagle part?"" apparently they had actual lines where they say things."

"the year is 2015. a variety of mishaps affected my well-being that year, but this one was entirely my fault. the moment of realisation was pretty strong so it popped into my head on reading this thread. it's june. it's my birthday. because of the messy year i had had, my annual bbq featured more guests than usual. friends coming over in support, i suppose. my bbq had been sitting in the garden for most of the winter, but i didn't think much of it. i gave it a clean and fired it up - there was plenty of gas in the canister, so i proceeded to cook enough meat to feed a small village. this went fairly well, and i was down to the last few sausages when i felt a warm sensation around my shins. ""hey the-go-kid, what's happening there!?"" screamed my friend's wife. a moment or two later i realised what was happening. there was a 3-foot flame protruding from the gas canister. like a mini-flamethrower. the rubber seal had corroded from the time it had spent not being particularly well stored in the winter, and with the canister being heavily used, it had decided to go full ellen ripley on me. there were around 20-25 adults and 10 kids in the very small garden at this point, so i figured, i need to evacuate. we managed to get everyone out of the way, and i ran upstairs to get my tiny fire extinguisher. i exhausted this thing on the canister, but it was so hot the flames flared up again. fortunately for me, my garden backed onto the fire brigade's premises, and within 2-3 minutes, the professionals were there and spraying all my food in foam. they were happy to take the canister away, saying it needed to be cooled for an hour or two and they would do so while drinking a cup of tea. it was all fairly funny in hindsight, [but it was soon overshadowed by what happened a few months later.](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9f5zu8/tifu_by_moving_in_next_door_to_a_drug_dealer/)"

8168	18697	693	btm0yy	ep009s1	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	woke up in a small ditch on the side of a road. i hadn't slept and was making a long trip by myself, thinking it was fine. i ended up nodding off at the wheel and woke up in a small ditch my car had gotten into. luckily, it was a small highway that was empty so there wasn't anyone near me when i fell asleep. my car was also okay, as was i, but this whole thing could have ended very badly. people please avoid driving when you're really tired. it's so dangerous, on par with driving drunk in my opinion.

"we were taking our s.a.ts and you are not allowed to speak or make noise during the test what so ever. during the middle of the test i let out this huge fart. it wasn't even like a quiet short one it was this loud 4 second fart. and the best bit was when the teacher mistaked the fart for someone like scraping the desk or something. it was so embarrassing!!! she was just like ""shhh no noise during the test."""
8175	18697	118	btm0yy	ep08acu	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	im wearing beige colored pants. i am in the bathroom, just before i am supposed to have a 5 minute-presentation. i pull up my pants too quickly and i accidentally pee some more. i get a huge stain on my beige pants that wont go unnoticed. small panic attack in the bathroom, eventually i start making my way to the classroom, because it's about to start. i walk through the crowded halls with a hand covering my crouch, probably looking like i have a limp or something. not grabbing the whole junk just having my hand there slightly infront. i get in class, i sit down. when i'm seated, i'm safe because the table covers the accident. i'm worried i get called up second to present, but noone calls me up. instead i just let people present and go up last when the stain is all dried up. situation saved, but man i was scared shitless. presentations are frightening enough.

8188	18697	41	btm0yy	ep0i9nk	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	when i was 7 my parents left me and my sister ( who was 10 at the time ) home with a baby sitter who lived 3 houses down. it was in the morning and my sister had just woken up and wanted cereal but i had the last bit of milk . her being the petty person she is , decides to eat the cereal dry causing me to feel bad so i went into the kitchen and put coco powder in a plastic cup ( no liquid mixed with the powder ) then i placed the cup in the microwave for 15 mins in hope of melting the coco powder so my sister could put it on top of her cereal . as if on queue my baby sitter left to go grab something for her house and she left my sister in charge . fast forward 5-7 mins and the whole kitchen was full of smoke , **the cup was on fire and the fire alarm was blazing the roof off and i was crying niagara falls. i knew i had fucked up big time** . my sister attempts to solve the situation by telling me to fan the fire alarm with a cloth as she opens the windows and dashes water into the microwave ( note that the fire was small but was big enough for water to not be able to distinguish it ). enter baby sister who's now dumbfounded to how i was able to set the microwave on fire during her 6 minute absence , who now calls the fire brigade and my parents to alert them of the fire. lets just say my parents didn't take it so well but on the plus side a firefighter correctly melted some of the coco powder for my sister ( before my parents arrived ) all whilst dying of laughter .
8189	18697	46	btm0yy	ep13nnn	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i clogged the toilet at my boyfriend's house. i was dog sick with a stomach bug and he was at work. the plunger was no help at all and there was no way a plumber could get there before he got home. i was in an absolute panic. there was no way in hell i was letting him see what i did in that toilet. it was the stuff of nightmares. i would have to move and change my name out of embarrassment had he born witness to what my body produced in that bathroom. i had no choice but to to unclog it manually. it was not pretty. i will never speak aloud of the things i did that day to keep my boyfriend from seeing my poop.
