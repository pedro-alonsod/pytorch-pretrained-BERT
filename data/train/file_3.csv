1782	48199	6433	bobtwf	ene9a0t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	not being able to hold our breath long (quick oxygen usage)
1783	48199	3612	bobtwf	enea2jc	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	tumors. organ ruptures caused by typical functions going wrong. many things about pregnancy. periods and ovarian cysts. also, for women, that the urethra is so short and so close to the vagina and anus.
1784	48199	44578	bobtwf	eneet9v	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	pretty much any autoimmune disease. the body can literally kill itself trying to protect itself.
1785	48199	17790	bobtwf	ene7nvp	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how fragile the brain is.
1786	48199	30518	bobtwf	enefzz0	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	allergies, or said another way, your immune system flipping the fuck out because you bumped into a peanut, dust mite, shrimp, cat, etc.
1787	48199	22168	bobtwf	ene7jil	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	there are many. but, notably to me is how easily damaged the knee joints and the spine are. they next to impossible completely repair. once damage they are never really right again.
1788	48199	38147	bobtwf	enebd4t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how close the food pipe and wind pipe are.
1789	48199	14444	bobtwf	enedpfw	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	put all these comments together and the human body seems like its all just a piece of junk
1790	48199	8198	bobtwf	ene8373	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	ears being so fragile and irreparable.
1791	48199	5725	bobtwf	eneku22	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	my personal greatest flaw in the human body has to be the immune system. sure, i bet a lot of you have perfectly functional immune systems, but mine has decided my gastrointestinal tract is the enemy and must be eliminated at all costs. so basically whatever programming error led to my crohn's disease, that's the biggest flaw.
1792	48199	9297	bobtwf	enemxf7	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	ectopic pregnancy ovaries are ovulatin and doing their things. eggs and what not. an egg decides enough is enough, and with the help of a hormone surge, wants out of that shit. bigger and better things. so the egg literally punches out, and is supposed to go straight into the fallopian tubes, get fertilized while inside the tubes, and then plant in the uterus. you would think that the entrance of the fallopian tubes would connect right to the ovary? nah the opening of the fallopian tube has these little hairs (fimbriae) that are like wacky inflatable tube men in front of sketchy used car lots, and kind of guide the egg into the fallopian tube. sometimes, the eggs dont feel like it going, and they venture off. and if fertilized, its considered an ectopic pregnancy. it can plant anywhere in the abdominal cavity at that point. most of the time, it will die because it has to plant in a well vascularized region to be viable. sometimes, it finds a good, bloody spot, and starts growing there. at that point its essentially a tumor, and of it can eat enough into a blood vessel, in can rupture and bleed like shit. you would think that millions of years of evolution would create a fallopian tube that opens up right to the ovary, but thats not the case
1793	48199	4548	bobtwf	enec9un	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	right now my shin is itchy for no goddamn reason. i think that's a pretty big flaw.
1794	48199	14226	bobtwf	enebwgd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	your brain replaying embarrassing moments over and over until you die
1795	48199	23839	bobtwf	enecfnw	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	breathing hole = food hole. squids have it worse, food passes through their brains. but then again i have never heard of a squid choking to death on a bite of bruschetta. &#x200b; edit: goodness me, thank you to all the people who informed me that we can breathe through our noses and that our breathing hole is the way it is because of our evolution so we can speak. you have all really opened my eyes. just remember the next time you are at a fancy restaurant and you find yourself choking on a bite of bruschetta just calmly breathe through your nose and talk to the nearest waiter, i'm sure they will help you out.
1796	48199	21757	bobtwf	enehuzt	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	if i wipe the wrong direction i could get an infection that could spread to my kidneys and kill me
1797	48199	5861	bobtwf	ene7rku	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that something as important as the brain can stop functioning properly because of chemical imbalances.
1798	48199	5230	bobtwf	ene8p04	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain should be better secured in the head. rattling the brain inside the skull can mess a person up, so if it was more secure it would be safer.
1799	48199	13364	bobtwf	enefiiy	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	[removed]
1800	48199	13424	bobtwf	ene6y6h	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	cancer. routine processes meant to repair the body create mistakes that in turn create tumors.
1801	48199	7078	bobtwf	enebwcx	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	you can control your bladder and sphincter. why of why isn't there a mechanism to hold in your period?
1802	48199	8977	bobtwf	ene76vb	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	getting tired and needing to sleep. i could have done so much shit if i hadn't had to sleep. though really, i probably would have just still not done anything.
1803	48199	9386	bobtwf	eneiodn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that we can bite the insides of our own cheeks. i'm sure plently of you know the pain of accidentally biting down on your cheek. edit: thanks whoever gave the award fam!
1804	48199	8811	bobtwf	enert4a	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	a quick tap to the testicles renders a man useless for at least a solid 5 minutes.
1805	48199	3841	bobtwf	ene92zb	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	too many pain receptors on feet.
1806	48199	2151	bobtwf	enebkdm	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the amount of time it takes for us to grow and mature to a level where we are able to contribute and not be 100% dependent on our parents/family unit. or the fact we have a useless organ that randomly ruptures and will kill you if you don't seek treatment for it.
1807	48199	620	bobtwf	enejrhn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain. if you don't treat it right; it can fuck you up. having you believing you need something when you know it;s bad for you. make you think horrible things and sometimes do horrible things. if you don't feed it positive information; you can grow up believing in evil, or ignorant things. and it controls everything.
1808	48199	2731	bobtwf	ened91u	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. most other animals who have a menstruation cycle, or something like it, reabsorb the uterine lining rather than shedding it out and causing woman to suffer from painful bleeding out of their vaginas for 5-6 days once a month. edit: i think that if we have to shed it, it should be a voluntary sphincter (like controlling when you pee). so woman dont have to spend so much money on pads & tampons, dont have to worry about bleeding through, can stress free wear a bikini, etc.
1809	48199	27671	bobtwf	eneccni	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the absolute randomness in its strengths vs vulnerabilities. a person can jump from a plane, have their parachute not open & survive the impact. or you can slip in the shower, break your fucking neck, and die on the spot.
1810	48199	20544	bobtwf	enefjy3	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	my schlong is more like a schlort
1811	48199	1265	bobtwf	eneqh8m	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the pain and complications associated with giving birth. giraffes can birth a whole tiny giraffe hooves and all and go about their day, yet women are still enduring massive amounts of pain (and/or death) during childbirth. it seems evolutionarily unproductive.
1812	48199	958	bobtwf	enegij5	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	wisdom teeth. they were useful when we used to have bigger jaws, but now they often cause pain and infection
1813	48199	5535	bobtwf	ened71t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	we're physiologically built to have sex with as many people as possible as soon as we hit puberty, but practically, socially, and psychologically, that's a *really* bad idea.
1814	48199	642	bobtwf	enf887o	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	physician here. 1) testes only work when they are located outside the body at the junction of two limbs that converge, funneling many stray objects towards them. 2) the low back. omg. dont get me started. 3) clotting is so complex its no wonder it messes up so often. 4) sinuses. like.why? and why do the holes leading into them need to be so small? 5) the immune system is really bad at stopping things it needs to stop and its really good at damaging the body. 6) we evolved on this planet, so why is the light of the sun too bright for us to tolerate? 7) our bodies like to store fat.in our arteries? 8) sometimes, the babys head wont fit through the pelvis. 8a) even by mammal standards, our newborns are remarkably ill-equipped. a newborn dog can crawl. a newborn horse can walk. we take a year to walk and almost two decades until we can fend for ourselves. ill think of more.
1815	48199	1143	bobtwf	ene6xpz	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the genitals arent protected by any bones and are utterly fragile.
1816	48199	15082	bobtwf	ene95hn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	teeth cannot repair themselves (i think?). if a bone can heal back together why the hell can't a tooth fill in a micro hole. in a natural state, teeth are pretty dam important. edit: just want to say thanks to all for the upvotes. it does not go unappreciated. may we all have perfect teeth forever.
1817	48199	14896	bobtwf	enek3iy	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the fact that theres so many things you can do to the human body without killing it but _oh fuck slept wrong and pinched a nerve now im fucking paralyzed_ (didnt happen to me, but happened to a semi distant family member a year ago) edit: holy fuck this comment took off edit 2: to everybody getting paranoid in my replies, dont worry: he was sleeping in a crowded camper on a small couch in a very, very awkward position this isnt a very common thing, but it does happen to people. so long as you sleep relatively well you shouldnt have a problem. edit 3: apparently reddits full of health experts who know for a fact that you cant do this. he pinched and severed something in his spinal cord from what i remember, im not 100% sure if it was a nerve but idk what else it would be tbh. _either way the point i was trying to convey was this man went from sleeping to paralyzed, so._
1818	48199	523	bobtwf	ene9kjt	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	definitely motion sickness
1819	48199	428	bobtwf	ene7785	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	cranial and neck structure. one wrong bump of the head and you can suffer serious injury or death.
1820	48199	1078	bobtwf	enejywk	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	our lumbar and ass aren't really that great at holding us up and this is why everyone has back problems regardless of whether they spend their lives working out, sitting in a chair, or in between. evolutionarily, we should have spent more time in trees waiting for our muscles and such to develop more to support the greater half of our bodies being held upright without destroying the system that's meant to do exactly that.
1821	48199	2950	bobtwf	enee4js	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	over-storing fat. i mean, i get hanging onto 20 pounds of the stuff just in case you need to tap into that energy - but at 50, 100, 300 pounds our bodies are still like well better still stock up, you never know if well find any food this upcoming year.
1822	48199	1044	bobtwf	enehy1j	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. not even fucking rats have them
1823	48199	4009	bobtwf	ene70aj	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that an amusement park doubles as a waste management center.
1824	48199	265	bobtwf	enf3o43	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the female reproductive system. the urethra is too close to the anus/vaginal opening. this can cause lots of utis if we aren't careful. our hips are nearly too narrow to birth our babies. we can literally split our vagina into our anus while giving birth. also the monthly bleeding thing, i'm fucking over it and i've still got a good 20-30 years of it left. it's a damned inconvenience on it's best days and a nightmare of literal blood and pain on its worst days.
1825	48199	685	bobtwf	enecoyh	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	getting a boner/sexually excited for no reason, and often at the wrong time.
1826	48199	744	bobtwf	ene9frx	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	self awareness
1827	48199	465	bobtwf	enehzql	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that thing our brains do where we walk into a room only to instantly forget why we went in there in the first place.
1828	48199	653	bobtwf	enei0bf	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	peeing a little bit when you sneeze or cough. wtf, nature?
1829	48199	1057	bobtwf	eneb6d7	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	water tube and breathing tube are same tube :(((((
1830	48199	214	bobtwf	enf25xu	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	birth and pregnancy are way too tasking on a woman. like, other animals can hunt, run, play, etc. literally hours before having to give birth, can get up right afterwards, don't have to take care of their kids for years, and their babies, y'know, actually fit when they're being birthed. we literally can't even give birth right. women used to die all the damn time before we made medical advances because our bodies are not fit to birth our own children, which *biologically*, is the entire fucking point of life.
1831	48199	70	bobtwf	enego9f	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	too many teeth in too little space. gets easily fucked up, and you keep randomly biting your tongue/lips/cheeks somehow
1832	48199	968	bobtwf	ene9xmd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain hardware has some compatibility issues with the software. i.e. patch random boners, agression instinct, need for attention, staring at boobs and affection for shiny stuff then we can talk.
1833	48199	137	bobtwf	eneezvd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the long start-up time from birth to functioning at the bare minimum.being housebroken, able to communicate, walk etc.
1834	48199	454	bobtwf	enehseh	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. as someone who never wants kids im always reminded of how pointless the whole process is for me.
1835	48199	64	bobtwf	enf06ap	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	compensation: an extreme example. problem in one part of spine, muscles on the other side start to compesate. pelvis becoms misaligned because back is not functioning symmetrically. now, spinal problem has made the entire back spasm to support, walking hurts, probably more prone to headaches now, etc.
1836	48199	193	bobtwf	enetozt	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	eyelashes and how they always find a way into my fucking eyes
1837	48199	97	bobtwf	enf06qx	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	scrotum. why put the survival of the species in the hands of a thin walled defenseless sack of skin?
1838	48199	98	bobtwf	eneoeoe	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	acne.
1839	48199	100	bobtwf	enez8h6	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	as someone who has been pregnant to term three times. the whole pregnancy experience is completely flawed. whoever designed the female body for carrying and birthing children should be fired.
1840	48199	211	bobtwf	eneiqxp	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	limited amount of telomeres &#x200b; edit: i didn't know that excessive telomeres or abnormally durable telomeres increase the likelihood of cancer. i should have just said mortality, nature can sort that shit out. i was under the impression that longer or more durable telomeres = longer lifespan, til.
1841	48199	51	bobtwf	enen7co	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	babies, in general. most all other babies are born and are fairly self sufficient or minimally dependent (with exceptions for certain animals i admit), but human babies are just crying poop machines for like ~3 years.
1842	48199	238	bobtwf	enefg19	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	aging. &#x200b; last i checked, living is 100% fatal so let's fix that.
1843	48199	89	bobtwf	eneyw6g	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	humans are the only mammals where the birth canal is too small to properly give birth to offspring. child birth isn't supposed to be painful, difficult, or time consuming. however, due to humanity's evolution to bipedal-ism, the pelvis shrunk and reshaped itself for a standing position. this change allowed humanity to become more mobile and flexiable, but at a serious cost.
1844	48199	117	bobtwf	enejw8w	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	where neovascularization (new blood vessel growth) of the eye takes place. youre diabetic and your retina isnt getting enough oxygen? lets make new blood vessels on top of the retina and cause things like retinal detachments. youve got macular degeneration and need more oxygen too? lets grow some under your retina and make you need shots in your eye. the front of the eye also can develop new blood vessels but this commonly takes place in the angle (the drainage area for aqueous). this leads to extremely high eye pressure and glaucoma.
1845	48199	81	bobtwf	ene9p27	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the sleep schedule sleep too much one night you wont sleep for long the next night
1846	48199	78	bobtwf	enfj7ml	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	"the neck. the neck is a huge design flaw. >""let's protect the vital organs by putting them inside a bony cage, surrounded by meat and muscle. except for the **most important one**. stick that up on top. because it's important."" >*what, up there? unprotected??* >""no no, it'll have like a shell. a hard shell."" >*oh cool that seems safe. so just right here between the shoulders? nice and snug?* >""nah i want it up on a stick, so it can move around"". >*ok we'll need to armour the stick then, if it gets damaged the life juice will come out* >""nah it'll be fine just leave it soft."" >*but the hoses that carry the juice.?* >""they're fine put them anywhere"" >*like inside the stick?* >""just anywhere, the front whatever, i'm going to lunch"""
1847	48199	129	bobtwf	enegf72	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. ~~here i am, trying to make her mayor of wangtown, and i pull out with rudolph the red nose dickdeer on my pelvis.~~ i find it odd that we evolved so that a fair chunk of half the species is in debilitating pain 1/4 of the month.
1848	48199	108	bobtwf	enegytu	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how we cant control every aspect of our brain, cause if we would we could just be like hey yo body, start growing muscle and your body would just be like alright ill get on that.
1849	48199	289	bobtwf	eneejle	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	lack of midichlorian.
1850	48199	99	bobtwf	enehax8	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that there is one part of your back you can never scratch with your hand.
1851	48199	31	bobtwf	eneks8c	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	eyeballs can't zoom in.
