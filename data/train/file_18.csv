3120	41212	133	bmjk7w	emxckkp	what's something everyone needs to be reminded?	to take a look around and see all the different people. people on message boards, people at the grocery store, other drivers and passengers going from here to there. these people are same as you just trying to go about their daily lives. think about when someone does something that makes your life a little better. like when someone sees you're trying to merge into traffic and lets you in. or when you're at the grocery store and needing to buy a carton of eggs but someone is in the way but they notice and scoot to the left a little so you can get by them. when you walk by a random person and they catch your glance with a little friendly grin. everyone needs to be reminded that we're all just bugs on a rock floating in space. sure we've got our ideas and preferences. but given 2 options: be a shitbag to each other vs being cool to each other - which one makes all of our lives collectively better? the world is full of lots of people. don't let your experience with a small handful of them color your opinion of all of them. basically all of us are just trying to get by and we can do that better together than apart.

3136	41212	63	bmjk7w	emy5sax	what's something everyone needs to be reminded?	just because someone is on a different political spectrum to you doesnt mean youre part of opposite tribes and hate each other. discussion between the two is what helps break down peoples negative ideas. building a wall between the two allows the far side of things to breed which is what were seeing now. social media and smartphones is what changed things. now everyone is connected to a constant news source theyve picked to affirm their bias, they only follow things they agree with on facebook, everyones opinions are more front and center now due to it being on their profiles. it makes it too easy to instantly find the differences between you and to dismiss them. i remember when election time came up in the early 00s everyone was talking about why they aligned with their party more and it was all quite civil. now thered be name calling and shit flinging guaranteed.
