6007	30742	2098	bugoyw	epcsiqa	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	gel pens. when i was in primary school there was this weird trend where all the girls would suck on the ends of gel pens so their tongues turned into different colours. they would trade pens with each other in the school bathrooms and sneak away from the teachers and go to hidden parts of the school yard so they didn't get caught, it was the closest i can think of comparing to a drug ring but imagine it with 7 year old girls. one of my friends was really popular because she was the girl who sucked on the most pens and would get caught in literally every class sucking on a different gel pen, and the teachers would always have to walk her out to the nurse as she'd make herself sick and throw up. they eventually banned them. i tried it once and spat it out immediately because it was nasty and tasted like ink (duh). i didn't get it then and i still don't get it now.

6009	30742	470	bugoyw	epdvqt0	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	am a teacher. a few years ago we had to ban applause. the kids would randomly start a round of applause and just. keep going. it was unnerving. it was disrupting lessons, assemblies. sometimes they would applause in the dining hall or corridors. still dont know how this trend started or why. the other thing we had to ban was pilgrimage. they apparently learned the word in religious studies lesson. after that they would (in large groups) walk from one end of the school to the other chanting pilgrimage! and basically knocking over any thing or person that stood in their way.
6010	30742	4109	bugoyw	epcpnbs	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	in elementary school my class was divided in two groups: penguins and rats. we would always go to our group for team assignments, for games, for anything really. somehow an actual rivalry started to sprout until the whole school was divided in these two groups, with first and second years getting into actual fights and stuff. pretty soon the principal cancelled recess for a day and went to each classroom to tell us penguin team and rat team were banned. others did create some smaller animal named groups after that but they all dissolved pretty quickly.

6014	30742	13604	bugoyw	epc8owc	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	when i was younger, we played this where you'd draw a circle on your hand, and other people would try to draw a line inside of it. if someone was able to draw a line in your circle, then you were out. the objective of the game was to be the last one standing. it was small at first, but eventually almost everyone in my grade became involved, and it spiraled out of control. chaos. pure fucking chaos. kids were tackling each other, running away from other students, disrupting lessons, etc. teachers eventually began to talk to us about how far our game had gone, and started banning it altogether. it was fun while it lasted boys. edit: thanks for the silver and the upvotes

6019	30742	8309	bugoyw	epbyzo2	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	rubber bands kids weren't even using them to shoot at other kids or otherwise misbehave with them. kids would buy packs of rubber bands, tie the rubber bands together, making like a big rubber band chain. it became a contest to see who could get a chain of rubber bands to stretch the farthest. you couldn't find a pack of rubber bands at a store for probably 20 miles (this was when i lived in a small town, so there wasn't a ton of stores in that 20 miles.amazon or even public internet access didn't exist yet) one kid got so many rubber bands, they could stretch it the length of the school building. while stupid, i didn't think it was a bad hobby as kids weren't shooting them or shooting stuff with them. it was all about how big of a chain they could make. school rewarded our pointless creativity with a ban on rubber bands at the school. all rubber band chains were confiscated on site.

6059	30742	113	bugoyw	epdt619	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	"i come from one of those all-girl private schools that disallowed anything remotely fun, non-academic, harmful or non-beneficial to our, that is, the students' and or the school's future. no slap bracelets, no rubber sticky animal toys, no phones in use without a teacher's permission, no outside of the box foods at the cafeteria and so on. anyway, one day, a girl in my year group, known to be ""rebellious"" and ""untamed"" by the teachers, (sweet and fun girl that took none of the school's nonsense), decided that we should rally together and develop a way to rebel in way that was both noticeable by teachers and not harmful to our futures. (we could be suspended or expelled.) and that we should do it on an important day. luckily, important guests visited our school often and the next visit was the following week. it happened to be the founder of the school. we read through the rule book for any loopholes we could've exploited. that's when i noticed that the student handbook that the wardens, teacher's, treated like a bible for ""uniform etiquette,"" said nothing of where a student was to wear their ties. (our uniforms consisted of a blouse, a navy blue skirt and a tie along with the school badge and whatever pins that aligned itself with school activities, such as house badges, student council badges etc.) the girl decided we would use this rule to ""host a revolution that wouldn't stop until, at least, some of the 'unreasonable' restrictions were lifted."" so on school's founder's visiting day, at least 90% of the student body started wearing their ties in ridiculous places. like some tied it around their waist, some tied them around their heads, some tied it around their arm, some of them used them as hair ties, the list goes on. needless to say, it made the teachers furious and embarrassed, however, the founder found the entire situation ""very funny, appreciated our respect for the school"" and praised us for our ""united front."" the ""red and gold rebellion"" was successful in more ways than one. (the ties were red, gold and black.) not only did we get our restrictions lifted, but we also became closer to the founder and was given access speak to him if more trouble arose, the teachers grew to appreciate the many more aspects of life and the entire student body became more like a family. anyway, after that, they refined their student handbook and specified where to wear your ties and more. they really disallowed rebellion through uniform loopholes after that, which i found hilarious. tl;dr: student body had enough with the heavy rules and restrictions, used a loophole through uniforms rules to revolt and got any uniform loophole exploitation banned."

"we had an independent market of dbz prints running around. you could go down to the public library and print a full page image in color for 0.25, but it'd sell for $1 in the middle school halls. black and white images were dismissed as freebies with trades. seeing how money was being exchanged, staff took up a ""tear any dbz paper found and throw away"" policy."

"pretty sure these were called click-clacks. i don't think they ever actually got banned, although you can't even get them now because ""not safe."" it was two solid, heavy balls connected by a string. you held the string in the middle and moved your hand up and down, making the balls hit each other above your hand and below your hand repeatedly for as long as you could until you missed. it took a lot of skill to do this and was really fun. the problem was, when you missed, the balls would slam into the inside of your forearms and leave major bruises. they tried to make a comeback some years ago, but the new, safe version used straight sticks of plastic, so the balls always connected. it was basically just a noise maker. no skill involved at all. what's the fun in that?"
6105	30742	28	bugoyw	epdqmo8	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	"pretending to shave someone's head. during my 8th grade year, a group of boys used to constantly go up to one another and use and imaginary razor to ""shave"" another kid's head. they would also make the sound of an electric razor as they did it. some kids even found apps on their phones that made the sound and soon enough it became a school-wide phenomenon. the teachers became annoyed with the constant sound of ""nnnyyyeeeerr."" after about a week or two after the start of the head shaving, there was an announcement over the loudspeaker by the principal saying to send any student who shaved another student's head to the office immediately."

6108	30742	32	bugoyw	epdu6wi	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	"i lived in the golden age of high school. we were allowed long hair on boys and pants on girls. ""designated smoking area."" if the electricity went out, you could smell pot in the halls. i don't remember anything getting banned. then again, many of us had older brothers who had lottery numbers for the draft. oh, wait. an unauthorized ""school paper"" mimeographed when no one was looking got a out-of-school suspension. the story was that the kid's mother went and complained. if he wasn't at school, then he'd be at the beach. how was that a punishment? oh, and the girls going bra-less was frowned upon. i knew one girl who was told to go home and change. (of course the principal couldn't say, ""go home and put on a bra."") the girl told me that day it took her three hours to go home and change. she lived ten minutes away. it was easy to hide in a graduating class of 600+ kids."
6109	30742	64	bugoyw	epc1sqr	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	not my story, but my friend has the kid that makes and hides literal thousands of 'moto moto bucks' around the school.

"hugging!!! when i was in middle school, so many 7th graders starting hugging each other that it caused students to block the hallways. in response, the school banned all hugging. this led to the ""great hug in of 07"" where all the students stood up and hugged each other during lunch. there was an article published in the charlotte observer. probably the most exciting moment of my very waspy middle school's history."
6118	30742	24	bugoyw	epdu771	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	we had a thing called 'spurring' someone. the premise was simple, you jump on someone's back and start kicking them in the side and see how long you stay on. believe it or not, it wasn't banned immediately. it finally got banned when my friend had someone on his back and he thought he was standing in front of some lockers, so he attempted to smash the kid against the lockers. turns out, he was standing in front of the large glass display case and they both fell through. the one kid was hospitalized for nearly a month from severe lacerations and almost bled out on the spot. just kidding, neither of them got hurt, it was just a big mess.
6119	30742	91	bugoyw	epdllhm	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	"the winter when i went in the sixth grade all of the boys in the two parallel classes would gather up every break and brawl eachother. every brawl was like something from a scene inlord of the rings, with sick speeches from the ""leader"" and men lining up shoulder to shoulder with their friends to take on the enemy class. when the teachers found out why all the boys in the sixth grade were no where to be found they forbid us to continue what they called ""world war 3"". ps. class 6a easily wiped the floor with 6b!"

6121	30742	26	bugoyw	epdsrmg	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	in my elementary school it was literally anything becoming popular. yugioh cards? banned. pokmon cards? banned. beyblades? hella banned. worst part was that some of the teachers would confiscate the stuff and give it to their own kid rather than returning it to the student or the students parents at the end of the day. i lost several holographic pokmon cards like that when i was seven and i have never forgotten nor have i forgiven that teacher. it literally happened after school, outside the classroom while i was waiting in the pick up zone for my parents. a friend of mine pulled the cards out of my backpack to look at them and this bitch of a teacher swooped in and grabbed them.
6122	30742	22	bugoyw	epc8gso	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	straws. in fifth grade, we somehow all got really into spitballs. so they got rid of straws in the cafeteria. edit: i think it originally started when a math teacher told us a story about spitballs in his own school days.
