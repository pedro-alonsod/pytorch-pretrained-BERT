3233	40837	181	blzj3m	emsmauu	"what ""typical"" sound can't you stand?"	dogs barking edit - my gripe with barking dogs is, when the neighborhood dogs are barking, it's 90%+ because riff raff (tweekers) are going down the alley, raiding trash cans, looking over fences, etc. basically i now equate dog barks with trouble. it's not the barking itself, but the reasons behind it.

"a coworker when he speaks in english at work meetings. we are all mexican in the department and we all have an accent (some more than others), but his problem is not the accent, is the constant pauses and repetitiveness when he speaks, you might think is just nervousness, but no, because what makes it unbearable is that he is very prepotent and rude. so you have this man, not able to speak at a fluid speed, speaking sometimes non-sense, but in a very condescending manner. &#x200b; if it is a meeting on skype, i remove my headset. if it is in person, i leave the room. also he is veeeeery confident in skills he clearly doesn't have. i can't stand him, he embarrasses the whole department when he speaks. we've spoken with our supervisor but asks us to be more lenient. not me, i'm tired of it. &#x200b; maybe is not the sound itself, but it was the only one that came to mind in the ""typical sound in my life i can't stand"" category."
