1203	50300	2083	bsomsy	eopza91	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	a lot of years ago i used to work as a solicitors representative (cases go to crown court, barrister deals and i am there for paperwork, additional stuff with client etc). 70 something year old man had been in jail for 15 years for an assault on a child. solicitor and barrister working on getting him released due to him getting clean reports from just about everyone. guards took him out of jail to a dentist and as he entered the waiting room he saw two children and ran straight at them. guards stopped him. 3 weeks later at court i was the one that sat him down in a room to explain that no, this isn't a hearing to release you. it is so you can be commited to a mental health secure facility for the rest of your life. he didn't take that well, i shed no tears
1204	50300	2411	bsomsy	eopvcko	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"not the client but my managing partner. the client was a senile 90-year-old man. he wanted to sell land worth a little less than a billion dollars to some businessmen. suffice to say there were many who wanted to take advantage of the situation. one such person, to my dismay, was our managing partner. the partner wanted to insert a provision that would have effectively funneled about 60% of the proceeds solely to him. you could see how his eyes gleamed at the mere mention of money. the provision ""got lost in the revisions."" i was doing the revisions. i'm no longer part of that scummy firm."
1205	50300	227	bsomsy	eopj52j	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	ianal but a legal assistant. we got a client off of a murder charge. 2 weeks later she was caught with a similar weapon and situation, except this time the guy didn't die.
1206	50300	10198	bsomsy	eop938y	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my general psychology professor worked for the state of arkansas assessing criminals to see if they would qualify as criminally insane. he told us a story one time about a guy who would get glass shards and hide them underneath his skin-presumably to use at a more opportune time. he said his interview with the guy made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end
1207	50300	21298	bsomsy	eop8kn4	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i'm on the other side, but i've got a defendant who went to prison for starving three adopted children to the point that they needed weeks of hospitalization, then got out of prison and married a guy with children so that she could start starving them, too. listening to her interview where she attempts to justify what she did to both sets of kids disturbed me more than any of the murder cases i've worked on.
1208	50300	13733	bsomsy	eopd9q0	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"we had a client try and enforce a post-employment restraint against a 19 year old receptionist after she quit and started working for a competitor. the reason? he wanted to ""make her life hell"" because she wouldn't sleep with him, a creepy 57 year old man. him trying to sleep with her was the reason she quit. unsurprisingly he didn't take our advice to discontinue his claim and so we ended up sending him elsewhere."
1209	50300	10094	bsomsy	eop837v	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	she tried to sell her baby. i found out during a hearing, in front of the judge.
1210	50300	22497	bsomsy	eop53k1	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"i listened to a 911 call where the victim's throat was slit while on the call by our client. i will never forget her gurgling and sounding like she was dying (somehow she ultimately lived through this) saying, ""he killed me, he killed me."""
1211	50300	14214	bsomsy	eopbod2	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	oh, i can share a good story. i had a teacher in high school who was a former lawyer. we always asked him why gave up his practice to start teaching. he finally caved and explained that his last case was the defense of three people. apparently there had been a fourth. it was two couples, who in the act of a drunken, drugged out orgy, decided to kill, partially eat, and dismember one of the women. i guess it seemed like a good idea at the time. as a lawyer, he said it was pretty open and shut, but he had to get his clients the best result possible, and he was exposed to all the horrid details, the pictures, and their reasoning. my teacher had such a far off look when he explained it that we could see it really got to him.
1212	50300	12466	bsomsy	eop7u0e	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	ill go ahead and say it. when i practiced family law and criminal defense, i trusted and believed my criminal defense clients 100x more than my divorce/custody clients. the worst monsters are the people who manipulate minor children for custody reasons. fuck them. luckily im out of that area of law, hopefully for good.
1213	50300	7736	bsomsy	eop9ka2	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"had a divorce client, husband and father, who disowned his autistic son, tried to argue that he should get all of his wife's retirement having not worked for 12 years, contacted me during the height of hurricane sandy (he was in the bronx and me in manhattan) saying he wanted to hold his wife in contempt for not paying him that day while the storm slammed nyc, told me i was making a huge mistake getting married (my wedding date was november 3rd, 4 days after sandy) saying that i was going to be miserable and regret it. i could go on. but, the worst was when, several months later, since his divorce was taking a long time, he sent death threat letters to myself and my wife saying that he had hired an ""executor"" to kill the two of us if his divorce wasn't finalized in 60 days. called the police and they said he left his premises one day earlier. i heard nothing from him until february 2014 when he emailed me saying he needed a winter coat from his wife and could i help get it for him. ironically, the divorce didn't have to be completed because he killed himself before the judge signed the judgment of divorce. tl;dr: miserable guy who wanted to spread his misery, and crossed the line when he threatened to kill my wife. edit : for something a little lighter, this memorial day weekend reminds me of not my worst client, but definitely my dumbest. i was representing her on a child custody and child support matter. she was calling me on memorial day saying she really needed to speak to me. i called her back and asked if it was urgent since it was memorial day and all. she said: ""oh, i didn't think that jews celebrated memorial day, so i thought you were going to be available."" edit 2: because so many people have pointed it out, i have now put the word executor in quotes because that was his word and not mine. also, since people have questioned it, my user name is also the name of my firm."
1214	50300	4761	bsomsy	eopbbln	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"my mom is a lawyer. this is the story about how she quit being a public defender. when you are a public defender you don't get to choose your cases. she got assigned a young man who, with the help of his gifriend, had gotten a kitten from a ""free to a good home"" ad in the paper. they then brought it home and gave it to their dog as a chew toy. i think they also filmed it. so yeah. she said she needed a shower after every meeting with him. canceled her pd contract after the case concluded."
1215	50300	16043	bsomsy	eopikoh	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i've done a lot of prison legal aid, and i could tell stories about child molesters that would turn you green, but instead i'll turn you green a different way. i had a kid (17) who was mildly cognitively disabled, due to brain trauma he sustained at the hands of his birth parents, who ended up with a really wonderful foster care family and thrived. he was a popular kid in school, good athlete, got a girlfriend and invited her to meet up and be teenagers one night in a corn silo - which i guess is a thing that country kids do? i don't know, this all comes from the pre-sentence investigation report i read before taking his case, but this girl met him at the silo and they were hanging out inside. by his account, they were having a nice time and he was really enjoying himself, then for no particular reason, he picked up a 2x4 and bashed her skull in. he then used a combination of very crude farm implements (shovels, hoes) to chop her body up and bury it in the corn and went home like nothing had happened. hey, you asked. eta: holy shit, i didn't expect to wake up to 11k in karma and 100 replies this morning, i'll try to reply to those i can. and i do appreciate the gesture of giving me reddit currency, but folks, reddit has enough money and when the firm needs more, they can go back to their venture capitalists - i would encourage you to make a donation to your local [united way](https://www.unitedway.org/#) or another reputable charity instead.
1216	50300	13082	bsomsy	eop33i8	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	the first week i started at my current criminal defense firm i was tasked with cataloging discovery from our client's phone. the phone had multiple (talking around 4,000) videos, photos, text exchanges with women under 16 (though not all of the girls' ages were confirmed most, if not all, were under the legal age of consent and many were barely pubescent) naked and being prostituted over 1 year. he would lure these girls in exchange for drugs. nothing felt totally bizarre until i came across one video where he was clearly forcing himself upon a literal child who was so high on benzodiazepines (not willingly but rather forced) and choking her in the process. when our firm confronted him, he said he was in love with her and that's why he did it. he would also take these girls to hotels and make them have sex with one another while he taped, but nothing beat what i said above. pretty horrifying stuff for my first week on the job.
1217	50300	17594	bsomsy	eopbs9t	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i had a client who was accused of domestic violence. essentially he threw his girlfriend out of a second story window. now hes got a terrible history but so do a lot of my clients and his attitude is a little entitled (also typical). but he also knows the deal and wants a plea deal. so im not really prepared when he absolutely refuses the no jail offer from the state (keep in mind there were like 5 witnesses). why? because they wanted him to pay for her medical bills. ok, an asshole but whatever not the worst. what did it was his counteroffer. i aint paying that bitchs bills. tell them ill pay for the window. prosecutor was not happy.
1218	50300	942	bsomsy	eope8m3	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	the first and last family law case was assigned to me as a first year associate. my client broke his wifes jaw, and said if they were home in russia he would have killed her because he could pay his way out of prison there.
1219	50300	1056	bsomsy	eop85uf	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	when this person (an executive) said she was firing any employee who had a serious illness or injury. while promoting fundraisers at a local church for cancer sufferers, no less (in part because employees, thinking she'd be sympathetic, would reveal their confidential health info to her).
1220	50300	16132	bsomsy	eop46g9	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	criminal defense lawyer. i can name a few instances where i was just absolutely disgusted with my client. caveat, these are mostly years ago when i was taking just any old case. i most practice white collar and federal now. 1. i won a dui case because the government messed up on something right before trial was to begin. my client gives me a hug and completely reeks of alcohol. he has driven to court. i took his keys and called his mother. 2. client who was accused of molesting a 12 year old. he was mid 40s at the time and i had to shut him down real quick when he tried to tell me how the 12 year old was coming on to him. 3. i represented a woman for a grand theft charge. left her in my office to get some things copied before she left. after she left, i realized my sunglasses and car keys were stolen. i tracked her down in the lobby and told her i was not going to represent her anymore and i would call the police if she didnt empty her pockets in front of me and give me my things 4. i had a client who was released after 25 years in prison for murder and then the same day he beats up his prospective new landlord. he ended up getting another 10 years. he was unrepentant and laughed about how he hit the guy so hard his eye ball popped out. i thought, this guy deserves to be in prison. took the case to trial anyway and (shocker) lost and he got 10 (the max). 5. client who pretended to be a doctor so he could sell steroids. according to the gov, he had numerous clients who were made to believe that his steroids would cure their cancer. they paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars and some of them died. i just thought that was pure evil.
1221	50300	2853	bsomsy	eop88pj	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my so's mother, l, was abusive. she frequently hit her husband, was a compulsive liar, and just generally made her family miserable. when they were settling the divorce, the judge initially deemed a testimony from the kids (my so and her brother) unnecessary, probably because they were minors at the time and testifying against one of their parents would be hard on them, to say the least. however, the lawyer representing l was really insistent that they testify. well it must've been a shock to the lawyer to suddenly have two more witnesses with dozens of accounts of driving under the influence, domestic violence, ect ect. we figured l must've lied to her lawyer about some significant details because they were completely caught off guard and more than a little angry after the testimony. we like to believe it helped solidify some of the criminal charges placed against her. it was a nice bit of karma after years and years of gaslighting and false rumors, that her own lies got her caught.
1222	50300	935	bsomsy	eop993l	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	defended my client in a lawsuit who defrauded his business partners. evidence was already overwhelming that my client was liable. client made matters worse by fabricating evidence and presenting it in court. he got called out on it by his dads attorney who had the *same evidence*. it tanked my clients case. my client continued lying to me despite the overwhelming evidence showing he fabricated evidence. he lost, big. in addition to a large judgment, he got hit with several felonies for fabricating evidence. also, the business partners my client screwed over were his dad and brother.
1223	50300	19222	bsomsy	eooviex	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	when i had to go to the us attorneys office to view the evidence in his case. there they were, the hundreds of images of child porn he had traded; the close-up images of his babys genitals that he had taken and sent around the internet; the pictures of his neighbors daughters playing in their kiddie pool. realized he just could not help himself. but he also never once claimed responsibility or showed remorse, so i dont feel too badly for him.
1224	50300	859	bsomsy	eoppfiw	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	**don't read this unless you have a strong stomach.** attorney's wife here. i used to help him file away evidence and reports. came across a file with video. curiosity got the better of me, especially when husband told me not to watch it. file gives this story: woman was at boyfriend's trailer out in the middle of nowhere, got pissed off at boyfriend, so smacked him in the head with a metal bat and went on her merry way home. boyfriend is apparently not a pleasant person and nobody really misses him or looks for him. he is fired from work in absentia. on day 7 boyfriend's neighbor finally stops by, hears hoarse screaming and calls police. that's where the video came from. day 7. one of the cops was wearing a camera on his uniform. it shows him and his partner going through the house, finding dogshit all over the floor. boyfriend's two rotweillers, who were also in the house, went without food for about 6 days before they started eating bits and pieces of him. the camera shows the moment the cop found the body on its side, rolled it over. and he's blinking. eyes open. with most of his face gone. the woman didn't even bother to let thr damn dogs out before she left. i do not help file cases anymore
1225	50300	1903	bsomsy	eopit18	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	oh man, i'm always late when i have a good one. not a defendant, but a divorce. client is a late 30s woman, two kids, idyllic suburban life with her [incredibly lucrative medical profession] husband. he caught her cheating. he wanted to patch things up, she decided on a divorce. so far - nothing out of the ordinary, unfortunately. then i start getting the details. he caught her on his birthday. in their bed. while the kids were downstairs. dude decided to come home early as a surprise, and his wife was getting dicked down by a 19 year old. but wait. there's more. really fun stuff from the husband. guy had been treated for gonorrhea twice, and both times he had caught it from his wife. the second kid wasn't his, it was obvious because the child was 100% [some race] and the 'dad' was [not that race]. bad stuff, right? well, enter the texts, e-mails, etc. she was carrying on like a dozen affairs at any given time. spanning years. she would bring them home, and tell the kids they were electricians, plumbers, etc. she'd fuck other guys within minutes of dropping her kids off at school. i've met some awful people in my time, but this woman straight up told me how much this guy loved her and how she manipulated the shit out of him. he knew about a lot of the stuff, and each time he found something new he just tried to 'win' her back. i don't want to go into the details of what happened, but some money that you get you don't really want.
1226	50300	732	bsomsy	eopgdtf	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	late to the party but anyways. my first internship in law school was at a matrimonial law firm in a very wealthy area, think millionaires and billionaires getting divorced. one of the first cases i worked on involved the parents of a victim of a high-profile school shooting. the parents were divorced and had been prior to the death of the child, and were now battling over who would get the victim's compensation fund money and the funds they received from a fundraiser they set up themselves on a gofundme-type site! these were *incredibly* wealthy people fighting over what was literal chump change to them and asking the public to donate to them as if they needed it. they were so clearly exploiting the death of their child for money and to piss off the other parent, it was honestly one of the most disturbing things i have encountered, ever.
1227	50300	732	bsomsy	eopiinn	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer, but work for a law firm as an investigator. one of our clients stabbed an ex-lover multiple times over $100. perp then ran out of the house all bloody. neighbor and her teenage daughter see him covered in blood and rush inside to see if they can help while they call 9/11. victim is still alive. on the 9/11 call the daughter made, you can hear the mom singing amazing grace while she tried to stop the bleeding. you can also hear the victim, with a stab wound in her neck, gurgling on blood while she tries to sing along. the emts arrived in under 3 minutes, but it took the police 19 minutes from the call to show up to clear the scene for them. she lived for 17 minutes. i saw the photos of the scene with the body still in place. it looked like a scene straight from dexter.
1228	50300	4739	bsomsy	eop4xly	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	edit: for those asking what's wrong with allowing the child to choose. the answer is nothing, so long as the child has the maturity and mental capacity to do so, and wants to choose. this child had none of those things, and was forced to choose right then and there between two people the child loved very much. also, i'm not making any commentary on which spouse was better; they both did this, ergo, they're both terrible. not a lawyer, but was a paralegal for many years. i worked mainly in family law. as i am sure other posters are doing in order to preserve confidentiality, i am going to be vague and also not include genders or locations. i had a client who was getting divorced. the client and soon to be ex spouse had a 12 year old son with autism. the two of them sat this poor fucking child down at the table one day and made him choose which parent he wanted to live with. our client called me to gloat that the child had chosen in their favour and to direct that paperwork be prepared. this client was a prominent member of the business community and earned quite a high salary, and was treating this child like a commodity. i was disgusted. i no longer work in law, but this one will always stick with me.
1229	50300	881	bsomsy	eopdfyd	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	had a client charged with bestiality with his pet goat. pictures of his undies full of goat hair and his bed littered with goat poo was something the like i have never seen in my career. when after the charges were dismissed (!!!) he asked me for help getting the goat back. smh
1230	50300	11814	bsomsy	eoovemd	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	life long criminal defense lawyer here. to be completely honest, its not about the offense but about the person. ive had people accused of murder that i really kind of liked and thought well of. ive had people accused of shoplifting who have given me the heebie jeebies and seemed like psychopaths. speaking from purely a criminal standpoint, having a client who is a monster doesnt matter in terms of your duty to them. but it does make the job less pleasant. my worst clients have been people who are comfortable scamming others of their money.
1231	50300	8546	bsomsy	eooyybg	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	/u/tinyahjumma stole my twist. murder, robbery, and most crimes involve regular people who did or may have done something stupid due to alcohol or situations. but the client you keep an eye out are the ones charged with fraud and the like. liars, cheats and all around shady people generally speaking. even the gangs operate on a code of conduct. an old fashion war like code of conduct. honor and courage are important to them even though they commit crimes. 22 years threatened twice. so not that bad. the real danger? not in criminal law. its family law. thats where people get really heated. its personal.
1232	50300	559	bsomsy	eophqml	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i saw this play out in court. plaintiff was a prison guard who was pressured/forced to have sex/oral sex with her boss (the warden) on a number of occasions. the warden threatened to have her fired and blackballed if she refused or blew the whistle. after this carried on for a long while, she quit and filed a lawsuit. but unfortunately her idiot lawyer didnt timely file with the correct authorities. at the end of the day, her claim was barred and the warden enjoyed sovereign immunity. at the hearing, you could see the judge asking the prison guard questions to see if there was a workaround or some way for her complaint to survive the pending motion to dismiss. but there wasnt. that was hard to watch. it was even worse when the prison guard began to quietly cry. fortunately the warden wasnt at the hearing, and the attorney representing the state was professional and just focused on the legal arguments. he dipped out of the hearing in a hurry.
1233	50300	251	bsomsy	eoq18si	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	criminal defense attorney. i represent a guy charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, domestic battery, etc. the guy allegedly grabbed his gf from her house and took her to the nearby river to kill her. he denies this entirely. recently had a 404b hearing (where, basically, the state attempts to get his prior bad acts admitted as evidence at trial) where three prior girlfriends all testified that he strangled them, beat them, etc. at least one was hospitalized for a broken jaw. guy does not deny any of it. i was forced to cross examine all of them and the only thing i had to go on was their credibility and possible drug use/lack of memory. not effective at all. additionally, the local paper quoted me pretty much attacking these victims of domestic violence. the guy's face never changed during their testimony. realized then i do not care if he goes to prison for life because there is a zero percent chance he will not beat more women.
1234	50300	910	bsomsy	eopdz6l	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	prosecutor here. most of us in this profession have the utmost respect for those on the other side of the aisle. most people really don't know or understand the really fucked up shit that we have to witness and deal with on a daily basis. there's a reason attorneys have the highest percentage of alcoholics by profession.
1235	50300	239	bsomsy	eopol6n	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer but a client of one i overheard a case of. this woman wanting her u.s. citizenship married an older man who was never 'hands on'. basically when the man went to file taxes he had someone do it for him, she made a deal with this person. they transferred his entire estate and accounts to her. but her citizenship hadn't been fully established as this was roughly a week into the false marriage. all of the older gentleman's money and assets were frozen because a foreign citizen 'owned' them. the case is still stuck in legal hell and i dont know what happened later.
1236	50300	1566	bsomsy	eop47px	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i'm a civil litigator. i've never thought my client is a *monster*, but there are a few i've thought were idiots or liars or both. two of my favorites are a client who instructed me, against my advice, to object to the temporary judge even though we had just discussed it and i had *just told the fucking judge we were ok with him*. and a client who testified pretty much the exact opposite of what she had told me in our initial meetings and what we had repeatedly discussed.
1237	50300	232	bsomsy	eoq2jsi	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"not a lawyer but friends dad is. he had a 48 year old manager from a janky sub shop that was trying to sue his 16 year old employee for ""defamation"" after the 48 year old took the 16 year olds phone and was looking at the nudes of his 16 year old girlfriend and attempting to send them to himself. the kid went and told everybody and the manager found out and tried to sue him. like you dumb fuck, why would you go and tell a legal team that you got caught attempting to put child porn on your phone? fuck man. a monster and a fucking idiot"
1238	50300	1497	bsomsy	eopdww8	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	civil defense here so maybe not as juicy as the crim defense folks. some of the work i do is employment defense, particularly sexual/age harassment/discrimination cases. im pretty cynical and see a lot of cases where plaintiffs are full of shit, particularly in harassment/discrimination cases. in one case i was defending a company and that companys manager, jointly. the manager seemed like a straight up guy and i pride myself in being a good judge of character. i was pretty convinced the case was just payback from a disgruntled employee. to my credit, the plaintiff, a 38 yo female, was a really poor employee by all accounts. still, it didnt prepare me from what i found doing a review of every email the company had stored on their servers. not only did this guy stick his hand down this womans shirt without consent, when she threatened to go to hr he said hed get her fired and make sure she never got a job again. the lady was a single mother with 3 kids. he also propositioned her for sex in exchange for a day off. he thought the email had been wiped because the company had a one year retention policy. apparently, some of the companys older emails remained on a sever before the policy was put in place because of the migration of the emails from an older outsourced it company (not sure if my terminology is right here). i had to substitute out of the case thereafter for conflict reasons since my two clients interests were no longer aligned.

1242	50300	26783	bsomsy	eoowzja	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	edit: very disturbing content warning. even though ive made a throwaway im going to be a bit vague because i still take my ethical duties to former clients seriously and cant breach privilege or the nda i signed. this is a story from a long time ago, during the summer after my first year of law school when i was briefly working at a well-known criminal defense firm. the client whose case i was working was one of several defendants charged with conspiracy to commit murder. three individuals had committed the murders, and several others had either helped plan it, abducted the victims, came along to watch, or ***filmed*** it. in order to see whether our client was one of the individuals present at the scene, i had to watch multiple videos of the murders. i watched multiple people brutally killed in about the worst possible way you can imagine - >!they were chopped into pieces while they were alive and had their skulls stomped in. it wasnt some grainy security footage. it was hd video taken by bystanders just a few feet away. the videos showed someones brain squirting out of their head and another person screaming as their hands and arms were hacked off.!< i also had to listen to the audio to see if our clients voice could be heard. the screams were bad. the laughter was worse. it has stuck with me for years and years, and i dont see it going away any time soon. thankfully my internship at that firm ended a few weeks later at the end of the summer. i never looked up the sentence from the case, and have no desire to. in our case there was no presumption of innocence - the individuals involved had all taken pleas in hope that the prosecutors wouldnt seek the death penalty. the only thing that would change was whether our client would get the death penalty (if he was present/filming) or life in prison (if we showed that he played a more minimal role). working in criminal defense meant setting my judgement for people aside so that they could be afforded the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. i still did my job to the best of my ability, but i found myself lying awake at night for several weeks in a row, praying to every god that i knew that each of those motherfuckers involved would fry in the electric chair, and that someone would laugh at their screams too. after that internship, i never returned to criminal law. i now practice civil law where i help people recover for wrongs done to them.

1276	50300	82	bsomsy	eoq61q2	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my worst client was a woman who was rude, aggressive, argumentative, paranoid, she thought everyone was out to get her. she had a terminal illness and still acted like a total bitch. i represented her in 3 separate civil cases. she had gone thru 2 lawyers already who dropped her. at one point even the judge had talked to me in his chambers after a hearing to advise me on how to deal with her (opposing counsel was present). i realised she was a monster when i had to present her for direct testimony and cross exam (before a different judge in a separate case) and she was probably one of the best witnesses i had ever presented. i had been dreading presenting her because her demeanour could subconsciously influence the judges mind. surprisingly, she answered all the questions briefly and directly, she was empathic, and she handled the cross examination like a pro. i almost felt sorry for her. it was like she was a totally different person on the witness stand. the way she was able to act convincingly like a decent human being, knowing she was a bad person irl, showed me how much of a psycho she was.
1277	50300	117	bsomsy	eoppp0h	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i'm not a lawyer but i have a pretty unnerving story anyways. i work as a police officer and got a call up about a mom and dad fighting. dispatch (i believe thats what they call it in america. i dont work there) told me that the dad was drunk and was very aggresive. when we arrived there we saw a little girl knocked out while her sister hysterically crying was trying to wake her up. the dad took the new born and left the house leaving the kids and the mom behind. later we found out that he killed the baby because he thought it was from another guy. it wasnt he was just too drunk to understand it was his kid. i got to talk to the lawyer of the family and she told me he had done some horrid things to them like taping the kids to their chair and forcing them to drink alcohol. but the thing that struck me the most was the 911 call the 6 year old kid made from the other room. it was the most horrible sound to hear her so scared screaming if the police could please come. at the end of the call you hear her dad entering the room hitting and kicking her because she called the police. i had goosebumps all over my body and will never forget that call. sorry for the long story and excuse my english it is not my native language.
1278	50300	161	bsomsy	eoprvd5	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	this is tame compared to many here and involved a civil case, not criminal. it might get a bit long because this was the first case i went to court for completely solo and left a lasting impression on me. i was doing some pro bono work for a legal aid clinic very soon after i was licensed (you get to practice all different areas of law so its great for learning, and the clients get free legal help) and they gave me this very easy case to dip my toes in on. simple eviction; my clients have received notice to get out for nonpayment of rent. i meet with them and theyre basically honey boo boos parents except every negative people of walmart stereotype you can think of: very entitled and aggressive, depressingly young but with a flock of children already. the wife says shes disabled so she cant work and as part of my client intake i ask what kind of disability she has in case it might be relevant or we could provide more assistance; she looks me straight in the eye and says i dont read good. knowing that, i make sure to read out anything i ask them to sign and try to make sure they understand the process. the gist of the case was they were living in a trailer home on some guys property, had stopped paying rent several months ago (i forget their reasons, but it was more the landlord is a jerk than anything actionable), and landlord has left them a notice to get out and actually filed for eviction. i immediately notice that the letter from the landlord is defective; he doesnt include some things he should have and had not waited the required time period (to give them a chance to pay and stay) before filing in court. so basically this is going to be super easy to get dismissed, but they dont have any grounds to challenge an eviction on (place is habitable, etc) so this is just a bandaid to give them more time to get rent together or find a new place. i explain this several times and stress that they need to either move out or pay their back rent. court day comes and its in a rural county almost an hour away at jp court. (justice of the peace, where you go if you get a speeding ticket. pro-tip: in many states these judges are not required to have any formal legal training at all.) we wait, our case gets called, we go straight up to the bench to talk to the judge. this frail old man stands, shakily holding some wrinkled loose papers, and slowly shuffles to the bench. i start to feel sick. the second he gets up there and the judge asks him to speak, my clients start loudly arguing and shouting over him and i have to remind them to shut up. landlord explains that hes illiterate and had to have a neighbor write the notice for him, and adds that these tenants are horrible people and have been harassing him and his daughter. judge asks our side, and my idiot clients both start shouting again. i finally get them to shut up and say your honor, the notice was defective, we motion to dismiss and hand him my motion. this poor judges face lights up at an actual legal argument being presented and he quickly skims my motion. he immediately rules in our favor, explains to the landlord that he will need to start the process over (give them new notice, wait 20 days, refile and repay the filing fee), then turns to my clients, who have the biggest shit-eating grins, and sternly tells them the same thing i had, that this doesnt do anything but delay their eviction. we go to leave and i feel god awful watching the landlord dejectedly slump away as i walk back to my car. im already thinking eff these people, im not helping them again (i had been very clear in my client agreement that my representation was only for this one court appearance, thankfully), when i hear them hooting and jeering. i turn to look and they have rolled down their truck windows and are shouting the most vile abuse at this old man as he fumbles to get into his vehicle - including nasty things about his daughter. they tear out of the parking lot cheering like their team won the super bowl, and on the long drive back, i realize a career in this is not for me. tl;dr my clients were assholes and i helped them prolong an old illiterate mans suffering via a technicality. still feel like shit about it.

1280	50300	118	bsomsy	eoplk3n	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"court reporter here: couple weeks ago a guy got sentenced to 90 years for killing his four year old. he was an abusive father, beat the kid often. finally he beat him so badly he realize he was going to get caught. so he boiled water and dumped it all over the kid to try and hide the bruises. then just left the kid. two days later the kid is walking down the hallway and his body just quits. loses control of his bowels. falls over and dies. the father than left him there for four hours before calling 911. when police got there he said he was clumsy and the burns were from the shower. they found he had 59 blunt force injuries, 16 to the head. the whole time the prosecutor was telling this to the judge during sentencing the guy just sat there shaking his head like was denying it. i asked the public defender after, ""how do you try to get someone like this off?"" basically he told me he tried to get him to have a lesser charge, not murder. and that he believes everyone has a right to a good defense. and he believes to guy has mental problems. but then he admitted to me it was the hardest case he has done because he has a 3-year-old daughter. that was a hard day at work. i can't imagine what that poor little boy went through before dying. i would have hated to had to cover the trial. i only hope the prison population hears what he did and give him some good old prison justice."
1281	50300	37	bsomsy	eophkbg	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	can i ask a potentially stupid question for me and all the others out there also wondering this? as a lawyer, when you are stuck with what is essentially a lost cause of a client (obvious murder, etc), does it negatively affect your job or is it so obvious that, win or lose, it doesn't ultimately matter?
1282	50300	32	bsomsy	eoq3mqt	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	years ago i worked at a criminal defense law firm. the lawyers i worked for were very selective of the cases they took on. they did have murder cases, drug trafficking, assault and so on. mostly i felt sorry for those people and their families. there was one woman though that was evil. she tried to hire a hitman to kill her son in law. just looking at her , and without knowing what she did, she sets off the vibe of a manipulative control freak. watch out for overbearing mother in laws!
1283	50300	33	bsomsy	eoqbgj5	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer but theres an infamous case in australia where i'd want to know what the defence lawyer thought of it all. &#x200b; his name was bilal skaff and he was ring-leader in the gang rape of 6 (known) teenage girls, ranging from him and 6 other guys to him and 14 other guys. there were times where they left the girls for dead after hosing them down and leaving them soaked to freeze in winter. this all happened (i think) in 2000 or 2001. his original sentence was appealed and he got less time. the evidence was damning and i'd like to know how the lawyer felt defending him. &#x200b; ps. his brother was also a part of it and reached his end of non-parole sentence, but when he applied for parole he was denied as he still claims it wasnt really his fault or that it was rape, instead claiming the girls were at fault/asking for it.

1285	50300	58	bsomsy	eopmpkj	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	client stabbed a guy in the neck because voices told him he was a god and that latinos (like him) were gods. he went crazy on the phone saying how people don't understand him (implying that he would stab people who don't agree with him). he was getting out on a plea deal after serving less than 2 years. i was helping him with a medical lawsuit. shit like that makes me very angry. also have defended murderers but they are usually polite to me. defended a guy who i found out later on. shot his daughter's cheating bf (lured him into the shed to help lift some wood then shot the guy in the back. pretty fucked up). cheating bf ended up burning himself nearly to death after surviving the shooting. defended a domestic abuser who took no responsibility. only people i refuse to defend? child molesters. can't do it. and i don't want to recuse myself from too many cases or i woudn't have a job so that's my line in the sand. also, i could write a book on obnoxious, ungrateful, childish clients. but that'd take forever.
1286	50300	56	bsomsy	eoq30sq	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"i've spent my career in property law. by and large, i would say that in civil law you don't meet monsters so much as realise that the real monster is often the whole way the law, or even society in general works. very early on, as a trainee doing a stint in employment law, i remember attending a meeting with a senior guy at some company that ran nursing homes that was a client of the firm. naturally, they employed loads of poorly paid, often female staff, and the main thing they were interested in was making sure that the workforce didn't get unionised and that the company didn't have to recognise unions. they did not want to have to pay their staff more or improve their conditions. not illegal, of course, and the people involved weren't personally evil, but it was a classic case of ""come see the violence inherent in the system."" to do what they were doing required them to be bad guys."
1287	50300	427	bsomsy	eop7yj4	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"like always, not exactly the answer to the specific question, but i doubt you're gonna have legitimate lawyers perusing reddit and telling you about their cases, seems like a very fine line of confidentiality to walk to tell internet strangers about things that happened in the courtroom, so i'll give my story. my ex-aunt has been through about 10 lawyer teams in what's going on an 8 year lasting custody battle. and we're not exactly in a place where there's that many lawyers, her last, and final, group she literally had to hire from another state because word has gone out in the legal community to not ruin your career associating with this woman. she has filed every cps/cys type of injunction accusing our entire family of rape and molestation to draw this out as long as possible. on my side, the one case that got brought up in court was that i had raped my then what would have been 8 year old cousin while i was studying abroad literally on the exact opposite side of the planet. obviously cys can't just ignore a claim like that, but when it finally got to a judge after these accusations and he realized ""wait, this kid wasn't within thousands of miles of the child in about a year from when this supposedly happened."" he brought her and her then lawyer up with contempt charges. i'm just vaguely describing it all, it gets way deeper and more fucked up. thankfully once a kid is 14 they get way more rights as far as court proceedings go, so he can finally tell the judge he wants nothing to do with his mom unless it's by his terms."
1288	50300	77	bsomsy	eoq1rjf	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	heard about this one through a friend: x is a young college student who gets picked up for drunkenly swerving through the road and had destroyed upwards of 10,000dollars of government and private property. my friend is graced with the task to defend. he says its going to be a quick one.gets back the next day, and he tells me the police searched the kids vehicles trunk and found about 400 pages of documents and six folders of photographs. the college student was bait for his parents and aunt and uncles to lure women back to their home where they would have a ritual orgy and a ritual burning of the body out in the middle of nowhere. they wouldnt keep any of the parts but they had a very lengthy record of how many people they were burning. those 400 pages.mind you not every page is each victim, they liked to document how the sex was and what the bodies looked like when they burned. apparently the student was off to get the pages and photographs bound into a book that he was going to make himself at a photocopy store for the familys ritual (not sure of the number) anniversary.
1289	50300	55	bsomsy	eopnuog	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	worked in the public defensorship in brazil (rio) and in a private law office: - had a guy brought up in the public defensorship that kidnapped his 12 year stepdaughter, took her to a city almost outside of the order of the state of rio, then made her walk through the wilderness for three days. they subsisted of nuts they found and slept in the wild, while he alledgedly raped her every day, several times a day. eventually he makes her dig her own grave and says he was gonna kill her, but then changes his mind and tells her to run. later on guy is arrested and brought to one of those cops tv shows and says in live tv how he was going to kill all of his wifes family and publically confessed to rape and more. when i got to talk with him face to face he confessed the kidnapping but denied the rape. i saw the photos of the legal examination (honestly, i think by far the worst part of working with criminal law) and there were indeed no signs of rape, but who knows. - had a guy in our office, an ex politician, we used to call him the brazilian hannibal because he was convicted of a triple murder and answering for another triple murder we cared for. guy could only communicate through video, since he was stuck in a far off jail in the amazon forest for everyones safety. - had a victim client we represented that was a dickhead - a billionaire that was swindled by his secretary. he called several times a day screaming at us and we had to basically act as his servant. during his hearing the judge asked him how he could not have noticed one time that 10k dollars had disappeared from his bank account. he said that 10k is nothing for someone who has millions. judge was not impressed by the dickishness of the statement and our guy lost that one. be aware that we prep clients before hearings but i guess he wanted to do his show. - had a case we denied legal resource because it was a confessed child rapist. we had two lawyers team, my boss refused to represent him, the other said he would but only if he was allowed to beat the shit out him. so those were my most glaring cases, but i had my fair share of pedophiles, wife beaters, racists, fraudster and pieces of shit. sometimes you also see people that were genuinely sorry for what theyve done and sometimes the actually innocent ones being dragged out through hell and back. still think criminal law is lighter than shit you see in family courts.
