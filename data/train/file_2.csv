1855	47462	611	brzuwa	eohvp69	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	physical therapy is seen as a regular part of recovery from of any serious injury. theres no stigma attached for someone in a cast or a wheelchair to see a physical therapist. mental health counseling should be considered in the same light.
1856	47462	9932	brzuwa	eohvbiv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	as someone with bipolar, i always compare it to diabetes. it's a lifelong condition, usually managed by medication though occasionally people manage without. the medication isn't always perfect, so you have to let those around you know the warning signs. if you ignore / stop taking your meds suddenly, you will have serious problems and may embarrass yourself in public. sadly, i've recently had to add an extra section to my explanation as part of an apology. if you're a diabetic in hospital waiting for your foot to be amputated, even if you took your meds perfectly, you get limited sympathy if you spent every weekend stuffing yourself with cake. for bipolar, the equivalent tends to be booze / drugs, and god damn is the level of substance abuse high amongst us.

1861	47462	1186	brzuwa	eohuxoq	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	it hurts to know that you can't trust anyone. you nevet know when someone is going to sell your secrets and tell everyone about that one thing you did when you were extremely ill just for some karma. you hear stories of crazy people doing weird things and know that some day you might be the crazy person people talk about for morbidness. and to get better you always need to trust nurses and doctors, and yourself. and that's hard to do when you're seen as an anecdote and not as a person.
1862	47462	798	brzuwa	eohxyzv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	please dont ridicule me for my coping mechanisms. i like to colour to help ignore thoughts. if im doing that instead of due tasks then im really struggling.

1864	47462	6479	brzuwa	eohuqrn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you're dealing with people who are essentially running with one leg in a two legged race. the bar for success for the mentally ill is much different than everyone else. for instance, someone suffering from severe depression making it to old age is sometimes a great feat. it certainly kills many before they get there. edit: to all of you who have replied and i cannot answer, cheers to you for getting up and doing what you need to do to get through another day. i know it's hard. i know it's thankless. i know it seems pointless, but you've achieved more than you think and can keep achieving more. congratulations on what you've accomplished so far!
1865	47462	1107	brzuwa	eohx66o	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	just because someone looks okay doesn't mean they are okay. i have a full time job. i have a house. i have a decent wage and i'm doing okay for my age. i also have borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, possibly ptsd, and traits of other personality disorders. i appear to function on the outside, but inside i struggle every day. i co-own my house with my dad, and despite living with me even he thinks i'm okay. people who are suffering often bottle it up in an attempt to not be a burden or to just try and get on with life, but it wears them down. reach out to your friends and ask how they are. let them know you're there for them. and if they disclose they have a certain disorder, do a little research think about how it affects them rather than how it affects you. you can't make them talk to you but you can show them you're there.

1868	47462	117	brzuwa	eohza0d	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i cant answer the phone. cant drive the car sometimes, even for groceries or prescriptions. cant go to sleep. cant deal with criticism. its like entropy, a small thing grows all on its own into an unrelated mess of disorganized anger and frustration often over nothing tangibly real. but its so real to me. it becomes panic. or anger at myself. to combat this i feel the need to be perfect, constantly. you could consider this a benefit, i often out perform my peers. but if i fail, even a little, im a failure to myself. i lost a hat in january and im still punishing myself for it. so to you, on the outside, i do everything right and that makes you think im okay, annoying even. i make good enough money and im successful in my field. but the moment im alone i pull the skin off my scalp with my fingernails and have almost no close relationships. i cant control how i feel. i know its not normal, but i know i do everything i can to try to cope. i probably didnt answer the question but thats the adhd.

"stop assuming everyone who skips school or doesnt come to work is just lazy or doesnt give a shit some of us peps with depression have a hard time even getting out of bed and u making nasty comments about us being ""lazy"" only makes it worse"

1871	47462	495	brzuwa	eohvri8	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"yes, i hallucinate. yes, i have voices in my head. yes, i'm not exactly completely sane, but that does not mean i can't function. i can still hold conversations, i can still hold relationships, i can still be relatively stable in public. also, i am not my mental illness. do not see me as, ""that depressed kid"", see me for who i am. there is so much more to a person than their mental state. and mental illness can affect anyone. age, race and gender have nothing to do with it (except for gender dysphoria). a four year old can experience ptsd and so can a thirty year old. it's all about environment."
1872	47462	563	brzuwa	eohy99j	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i know i overreact, i know im too sensitive, i know i make things difficult. i know all of these things make you uncomfortable and inconvenience you but maybe just take a second to think about how much they affect me.
1873	47462	782	brzuwa	eohut24	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"talk about it. suicide is the second most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, so they are a big clientele to reach. but also middle-aged people are at high risk, especially men. you can share articles that talk positively about mental illness and recovery, along with being active in foundations for suicide prevention like the [afsp in the us](https://afsp.org/take-action/), the [nspa in uk](https://www.nspa.org.uk/) or whichever it is in your country. most importantly, if you know someone who is feeling down or has suicidal thoughts, the best thing you can do to help is listen and ask directly ""do you have suicidal thoughts?"". this leaves them with a simple yes or no question, so they aren't the one who have to ""say it out loud"". don't panic when someone says ""yes""! you can have suicidal thoughts without wanting to actively take your life,; they are a coping mechanism for underlying issues. if you think you can handle it, ask how persistent they are, if they can distance themselves from those thoughts or if they have a plan on how to take their life. make sure to use the word ""suicide"" or any phrases without a negative connotation (see: ""killing yourself""). **don't** give advice: just actively listen and comfort them in a way that doesn't make them feel trivialized or judged. staying away from any moral judgements (regarding their feelings) is very important! also, you can offer to support them when they plan to get treatment, like accompanying them when going to the doctor, figuring out who to call and so on. there are also some chat or mail-based counceling options if speaking in person or on the phone is too much for them. edit: clarified some points, different wording"

"i hate being told that my decision isnt mine because im autistic for example i wanted to go to a school where all of my freinds were going i was repeatedly told to not go because my autism chose it and the proper adults should choose where i go i had also stayed with my aunt who padded the walls with pillows and kept feeding me organic localy grown vegetables for the weekend to cure my and in her words ""retareded ass brain"" have aslo been bullied anx made fun of and beaten by other kids because of my autism edit: holy hecking doody poop the ammount of support from all of you is amazing oh yeah caps lock is on lol"
1875	47462	364	brzuwa	eohvrf2	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would say the prevalence of antagonist characters that have a (usually misrepresented or grossly inaccurate) mental health issue is a problem. same for a lot of true crime documentaries and the like, where they speculate on whether the perpetrator might have had some kind of mental illness without explaining the illness correctly, or write off a person's actions as being down to the effects of the mental illness. i can tell if someone has been influenced by this kind of shitty pop culture by the way they look at me and others. no, being bipolar does not mean i might murder you for no logical reason. in fact, it makes me statistically more likely to be murdered or a victim of abuse.
1876	47462	278	brzuwa	eohv85g	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	everyone is unique and so is their experience with mental illness. no two people with depression will experience the same thing nor will two people with anxiety react the same way to the same things.
1877	47462	91	brzuwa	eohv8hk	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would like to say how wonderful my patients have been. most people are just looking for help and support on their way to recovery, like you would do with any physical illness. i mainly work with schizophrenia patients, and i am lucky to have met a whole variety of people from different backgrounds, with different interests and hobbies, who go about their lives like everyone else, just with a few more difficulties along the way! stigma is still real, despite the 'awareness' campaigns. i suppose it's best to remember that people with every type of mental health 'disorder' live by your side, they may be your neighbour, your teacher, your employee, your friend. don't isolate these people from society, help them by creating opportunities for them to join in! if you are in the uk at the moment there has been a good series of mental health documentaries that you can watch on iplayer. including 'psychosis and me', 'anxiety and me', and 'depression and me'. as well as the latest from louis theroux, i highly recommend you check them out.
1878	47462	4488	brzuwa	eohu0mm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	we literally have no control over what our mind is doing, feeling, or how its going to react to anything. there is zero control. be understanding that this is much harder for the sufferer than it is for you. your brain is an organ and like any other organ it can get sick or weakened or simply not work as strongly or efficiently as it used to. you wouldnt expect someone to just get over or snap out of a heart attack or kidney failure. its unfair to expect the same of mental illness. edit because this got a lot more popular than i ever expected. while most people are agreeing with me, some seem to think im being damaging in what i say so ill make it clear. what goes on in our mind we cannot control. the thoughts, compulsions, panics that just appear we cannot preempt or stop. we *all* can, however, work hard to recover. we can seek help, get medicine, use coping mechanisms that will help us control how we act and react. but nobody can ever convince me we can just stop thinking the things that pop into our brains.

"people with personality disorders are not inherently abusive or bad, ""crazy"" people."
1880	47462	121	brzuwa	eohuuf5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	people are coping the best way they can based on their experience. for example, someone who yells and turns people away can just be trying to comfort themselves based on past experience of letting someone in and being hurt by it. treatment is about learning new coping skills that will give people comfort that also gives them other things they need in their life (relationships, stability, etc.)
1881	47462	433	brzuwa	eohw6pw	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i know this isn't exactly what your asking for, but as someone who works in mental health, has suffered from mental health issues and has witnessed some of the effects. get. off. social. media. reddit isn't too bad because it isn't tied to your personality and identity. but get off instagram, facebook, snapchat and any other media that is linked to your real identity and self worth. those platforms are directly responsible for more harm to young people's mental health than everything else combined. i know of multiple suicides, attempted suicides and self harm cases that are a result of interaction on social media. i work in the nhs and we can't keep up with all the depressed teenagers that come in with depression and anxiety brought on by social media use. this in turn is stopping us from treating serious cases of mental illness. every single young person who has deleted their social media accounts on professional advice (in my service) has immediately felt a significant improvement in their mental health, their self worth and a reduction in their anxiety. please, if you do nothing else this year. delete your social media apps, wait for the withdrawal to wear off and feel the freedom that comes with not feeling like your whole life is on show and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone. edit 1: under no circumstances should you feel like you are taking up a professionals time. i know i said we're overloaded, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help. definitely seek help if you feel like you aren't coping. edit 2: if you have a healthy relationship with social media then that's great, but if logging into instagram has you feeling fat, worthless, boring, ugly, poor, stupid, or any other negative feeling. delete it. cheers for the silver. well shit. gold too. thanks a bunch.
1882	47462	111	brzuwa	eohvtuv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"as much as i wouldn't wish my mental illnesses on anyone, there have been many times i wish someone could live in my head for just one day. the constant thoughts of ways and planning and just running thoughts of suicide and anxiety about the simplest of things is so very exhausting. and as much as i would love to ""just get over it"", it takes a lot of work to feel like what i imagine a ""normal"" person must feel like. also, i need those meds just as much as a person with heart disease or other chronic illness needs theirs. i cannot function without them and therapy. stop saying i don't need them!!"
1883	47462	55	brzuwa	eoi3wo2	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	suicide isnt an 'egoistic' choice. if a severely depressed person comitted suicide, he/she did it because they felt that the people left behind would do much better without them. they actually commit suicide to help relatives and loved ones.
1884	47462	158	brzuwa	eohvxd5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	bpd is not inherently abusive, and people with it can be good people and live normal lives. on that vein, not everyone who acts irrationally/in a way that offends your sensabilities will have bpd, and if you know someone with bpd who acts a certain way, thats likely not universal. just dont stigmatise and overgeneralise.
1885	47462	305	brzuwa	eohuvxa	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"we don't choose to act this way for ""attention"" or because we ""want to"". i didn't choose ect because i felt like it. i want to be able to get up and do things like work, go to school, start my life but i can't. we have empathy for people if they broke their leg, why is it not the same for mental health? also stop romanticizing it; suicide is not ""cute"" or ""cool"" (i'm looking at you 13 reasons why). also: mental health is not just depression or anxiety. there is lots that don't get brought up like schizophrenia, bi-polar. way more than i can think of. here is a list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mental_disorders source: 26 (turning 27) year-old on disability due to depression, anxiety, and ptsd. did six rounds of ect. was diagnosed with my mental health issues ~10 years ago now."
1886	47462	92	brzuwa	eohw6dm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i want people to know that wrong treatment and diagnonsis can set back a person's recovery by years! there is nothing wrong about not having chemistry with your therapist and finding someone better suited to help you. my battle lasted for years and nearly killed me. i spent more time in hospitals than at home. pushed back and forth to different facilities cause nobody would take responsibility. i was stuck. then one day one of the chief doctors decided to send me the fuck away to another district and everything changed. they gave me time. we spent 6 monts doing tests. new diagnoses, right diagnosis. today: no self harm, no episodes no hospitals for 9 years. i was the patient they thought would die in the system. or to selfharm, or suicide. i was that patient. and by that you all know what that means. the point in all of this is: get proper treatment. never give up. never stop fighting for your right to be better, to get the help you need. cause it will get better. dont settle no matter how hopeless it is. wrong diagnosis and medication matters more than you think. i believe in you.

"i am bipolar. people don't know how to react when you tell them you're ill. which i understand of course. we talk a lot about people that are mean or treat you like you're crazy and stuff. it sucks obviously but we talk so much about them that we forget about the other side of the coin. when people are too benevolent or sympathetic, they can also cause damages. i am surrounded by friends and by my family and they all support me which is great and i'm very greatful for that. but sometimes (or always) they have absolutely no idea what to say but feel like they must say something no matter what. they usually try to reassure you but doing this they just get the opposite reaction. i call it minimization. basically, they tell you not to worry, what you're experiencing isn't that bad don't be afraid, they also feel like this sometimes it's gonna be fine stop. doing. this. it's the worst. imagine you feel like shit or that something's reaaally wrong and you're afraid, and then someone tells you ""meh it's okay everybody have ups and downs ;)"". all my friends and my family (except my sister) do that. now everytime i fell like something's happening, i'm asking myself ""do i really need to see my doctor? is there really something wrong? am i faking it?"". so yeah, not useful at all, i'd rather be told to worry so i can get some help instead of keeping it to myself. also it's painful and really annoying so now i just don't talk to anybody at all, except my sister. what does she do ? what do i personally want people to do ? just listen to my rants or worries or news from my doctors, but don't say anything. accept that you will never understand it so don't try to give advice, judge (yeah some friends told my i take too much meds and that they worry), relate, reassure, etc. i just need a shoulder to cry on and that's it. the only people that i will listen to are my doctors, and that's it. it's my personnal situation so maybe other will disagree with me."

"mental illness can happen to anyone, literally. it's as common as physical illnesses like the common cold. part of removing the stigma is to talk more openly about it, to stop the whole ""hush-hush, behind closed doors"" thing. anxiety and depression are among the most common, and lately i've seen a rise in eating disorders (looking at you, influencers who promote body dysmorphia with plastic surgery they claim is achievable with diet and exercise, and especially influencers who push intense diets and weight loss products. you are literally causing damage to people with your pursuit of fame and money). bipolar, schizophrenia and personality disorders are treatable. they're not something to fear. important to note too, that personality disorders can be incredibly mild, and don't necessarily need treatment unless it impacts your life negatively."

"there is literally nothing wrong with having to take medication for a mental illness. it doesn't mean you're creating ""artificial happiness"" or a dependency issue. you're correcting your brain's shortcomings with the resources that you have available. we do what we have to do to improve our mental health"

"you are not ""a bit ocd"". you might be pedantic or fussy about things, you might even get obsessive, but just liking things to be generally neat and tidy and done properly is not ocd. you can't 'be' a disorder, anyway! obsessive compulsive disorder can be completely debilitating for people who live with it, and folks going about saying ""omg i'm *sooo* ocd!"" completely trivialise sufferers' struggles and the shit they have to deal with in their heads. someone is far less likely to open up about their compulsions if they think the people around them will dismiss the issue - or even mock them for it. acknowledge that you're fussy, sure, but please don't tell people that you're ""totally ocd"" about things."

1892	47462	37	brzuwa	eohwqzm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i think my concussions have fucked me up permanently. i grew up playing hockey every day for 15 years, trying to make the nhl. but after being knocked unconscious for the 10th time something. changed. my long term memory is non existent, im very irritable and depressed. i cant look people in the eyes anymore. i went from social butterfly to a compete hermit shut in that cant bare being in public. are these things correlated? my parents refuse to believe they are and they think im being dramatic. im not. i think about suicide on a daily basis. i was *never* like this until my last violent head trauma. ive probably had over 25 instances of severe head trauma (*at least*), i only know for sure of the ones where i was knocked out cold.
1893	47462	37	brzuwa	eohwtu1	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"as someone who suffers from schizophrenia, one thing that i hear the most is """"shouldn't you be locked up?"" . seriously people? i thought society has moved past the point where psychopaths in horror movies represent what a disorder is actually like. no, i will not murder your child. no, i will not commit any other crime you might be thinking of right now. relax, we aren't as dangerous as you think. in fact, we aren't that dangerous at all ( most of the time. ) why not give me a goddamn chance?"
1894	47462	67	brzuwa	eohvgef	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you wish to understand someone with a mental health condition please educate yourself and research the condition. i have a lot of people who claim to know and try to give advice. once you've worked with professionals the average persons advice can become awkward and patronising at times. learn before you weigh in. it's a very sensitive subject and would go some way to lessening the stigma if more people educated themselves.
1895	47462	129	brzuwa	eohvm2j	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	dont stray away from a person if they confessed their struggles to you. theyre probably in a very difficult situation and trust you enough to tell you about it. you should get informed about their mental illness and try to fix it with them. or just be supportive at least or get someone who can help more than you involved but i just beg you dont under any circumstances stray away from them
1896	47462	30	brzuwa	eoi1zvd	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	were trying, please just be patient.
1897	47462	55	brzuwa	eoi1fug	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	anorexia is not a disorder of vanity. i have this disease and am also doing my phd on perceptions of eating disorders. eating disorders are so incredibly complex, yes they are a disorder of control, but it goes deeper. as a start, if i could change one thing tomorrow or would be the normalisation of commenting on peoples weight. also, you cant simply assume the severity of this condition by a persons weight. eds come in many forms, a lot of sufferers dont look like the media-depicted version of anorexia. be gentle on us and put down your assumptions.
1898	47462	25	brzuwa	eohvxnu	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i try my hardest. but sleep overtakes me. i cant stop it. im tired 24/7. i want to be outside. i want to go out and do things. but i cant leave the bed without all my willpower.
1899	47462	29	brzuwa	eohw4hv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i was diagnosed with bipolar-ii disorder and depression about two years ago, which to me, was a relief. until that point, people close to me would sometimes point out that i seemed to be out of it. i'd be extremely emotional, unable to focus, and paranoid (to a lesser degree than the other two, but still). over time, i had become desensitized to these things and they became my new normal. after starting medication, then forgetting to take it, followed by a short involuntary commitment to the local hospital, and then constant and proper use of my medication, it hit me. before seeking treatment, i just didn't know anything was wrong. my point is we often don't know something is going on until others point the signs out to us. i sure as hell didn't. nowadays, i'm doing much better! the depression is under control and the bipolar-ii stuff is mostly controlled. i do have manic episodes once in a while, but it's usually just me starting to write about stuff and becoming bored. the depressive episodes don't happen anymore. yay! i'm starting my senior year at the local university in august, so everything is looking good from here. maybe i'll meet someone and end up with a girlfriend. who knows? so yeah, look out for the people you are close to. you might be the first one to pick up on something.
1900	47462	28	brzuwa	eohy2ap	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	those struggling are often experts at hiding it. just like how it's extremely hard to spot someone drowning in a crowded pool, it's almost impossible to know who of your friends, family and peers is struggling with their mental health if they don't tell you. i can guarantee you that you personally know at least one person struggling with their mental health. if you don't know who it is, they are trying so hard to hide their issues because they are scared of how you (or others) will react. you might have spoken to them about their very issues (maybe even in a negative way) and never knew you were directly addressing them. mental health isn't padded rooms and strait jackets, it's real people with real issues. there should be no stigma or shame for being a human being.
1901	47462	27	brzuwa	eohy5s5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism. it's a spectrum for a reason. not everyone's super smart with a lovable tick like media loves to portray us, some of us feel like shit because we're expected to be prodigies by even our own families, but some of us can't even do simple tasks without going through a ton of mental stress and burning out.
1902	47462	29	brzuwa	eohya5a	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	behavioural health tech of 3 years. ive had every type of person come through my facility. from your preschool teachers to executives of fortune 500 to clergymen to college students. no one is immune from stress and mental health. dont let the fact that youre getting straight as make you feel like your not the ones that need a counsellor. or that because people usually vent to you that you dont need to vent either. bad stress is bad stress. and sometimes, even for the ones that seem to have it all, can make a person crack. get help before you crack. because once you do, its much harder to come back from then having too much stress.

1904	47462	23	brzuwa	eohxjg7	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	nobody can continuously move upwards. if you go back a few steps, that doesn't mean you didn't go up those steps in the first place. you've done it before and you can do it again. stagnating or even regressing is perfectly normal, entirely human and expecting otherwise is irrational. the sooner you realize that the sooner you'll be able to put the breaks on how hard you're crashing and start working on going back up those steps and further.
1905	47462	23	brzuwa	eohw1ei	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you would go to the doctor to treat a broken leg or diabetes or pneumonia. mental health treatment is just as valid.
1906	47462	118	brzuwa	eohvnaz	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	im not lazy. telling me im lazy makes me feel even less motivated and hate myself even more, thus making me want to lay in bed all day wallowing in my own self hatred. i want to be good at things and excel, i just cant especially when im being told im lazy. i want to shrivel up and die most of the time, you shitting on me makes me want to hide in my cocoon thus making me stay in this rut. im proud of you for doing x has literally made me cry. even just taking care of myself and having someone say you look really good, im proud of you for coming out means *a lot*. positive reinforcement means everything when you have severe depression.
1907	47462	21	brzuwa	eohywkf	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop handing out borderline personality disorder as an armchair diagnosis. the only way you can diagnose anyone is if you're a licensed professional seeing a client, face to face. other than that, no you can not diagnose anyone with anything, because you have no training and are not a professional. it gets under my skin the amount of times i've seen a bpd diagnosis get thrown around by people who have no idea what bpd actually is. the only thing that throwing around a diagnosis does, is further stigmatize people like myself who actually suffer from bpd. which sucks because it's already an extremely stigmatized disorder.
1908	47462	20	brzuwa	eoi8yfn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop villainizing meds. i have bipolar disorder and its so hard to hear people bash medications and suggest meditation or natural remedies or other such bullshit. the medications keep me alive. without them i would have killed myself or gotten locked up decades ago.
1909	47462	39	brzuwa	eohv7rl	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	with bipolar there are times that i need to be completely left alone to allow me to stay in my mindset, and their times where i need people to intercede and grab my hands or head to kick me out of whatever mindset that i have been locked into. unfortunately i may not show any outer signs which i'm in and both ways i have very little control. hopefully (like i have done) a bipolar person will train themselves to have a trigger which it allows you to ask the question of which problem they're having. for me if you hand me a coke or any liquid it pulls me out of my mind long enough that you can determine or you couldn't ask which part of the bipolar i mean positive or negative.
1910	47462	39	brzuwa	eohvvfx	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	telling me to chill out, relax or not worry doesn't help. instead it creates more anxiety. some days little things set me off, some days when everything goes wrong i do not panic or cry till the end. i can not turn the worry off. anxiety has crippled me for years. if i say i don't want to go out or can't handle the store, please realize i cant and the smallest tasks to me seem like conquering mount everest. also stop recommending diets, yoga or meditation. if it was that easy i would, sometime medication is the only thing that helps.
1911	47462	82	brzuwa	eohw7q8	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i am a guy with autism and add and i want to say: just because someone has autism or other behavioral issues, doesn't mean they get a get out of jail free card, it's understandable, no excusable. if susan's 5yo is running around pissing on everything, but has autism or some other mental illness, doesn't mean they can still run around shooting out liquids out of its fuckin bodily sausage
1912	47462	94	brzuwa	eohwmco	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	self injury and scars: i spent 10 years of my life selfharming. more stitches then i can count. my arm is completely scarred and ruinied. how does that make me feel? honestly. it took me alot to get here, but i am not ashamed. i am proud that i can wear my stripes with my head high. cause for years i hid my arm under long sleeves and a black long gloves (i cut the glove-fingers off.) i got so many questions. remarks. and one day i just felt done. of hiding. i took the glove off, trying it out. and its the most liberating thing ive ever done. yes people look, but surprisingly not as much as you would think. it is pretty clear to everyone what i have done. people commented more when i tried to hide it. so i wear my scars proudly. ive been told by others who has selfharmed that they feel inspired to do the same. cause in all honesty people, as cliche as it sounds, they are your battlescars. the proof you despite all this pain, made it through . if people ask, be honest. if people stare, smile back. let them stare. its not dangerous. think of the road it took you to get here. and here you are. putting that chapter behind you. showing everyone that you fucking made it ! now how is that something to be ashamed of?

"crying is okay. being scared is okay. nothing is ""easy"". some people may not be able to finish the ""easiest"" task. for some people getting up in the morning takes so much energy, that they don't have enough for anything else. stop comparing anything or anyone. yes, some people may gone through worse - but each and every being is different."

"i was in class yesterday,social psychology class giving a presentation on discourses. i made my presentation about how i suffer with bpd and what life is like with it,how it affects me and what people think of me. i made a slide with traits and characteristics of me as an individual versus the traits i display when my borderline personality disorder acts up. at the end of the presentation,she made me go back to the slide and asked who else in the room experiences intense anger,unstable interpersonal relationships,feelings of emptiness,etc. and that not one person can say they've never experienced at least one of the plethora of symptoms. many ""normal"" or ""regular"" people experience those symptoms,albeit not 5-9 all together but they experience some,and they are not labeled as freaks. so what makes people without mental illness be able to judge someone else with a mental illness when they experience similar symptoms."
1917	47462	15	brzuwa	eoiasg9	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"just because your having trouble focusing today doesn't mean you have adhd. i'm tired of the ""lol. i'm so adhd! squirrel!"" shtick. if you truly had this disorder, you'd have trouble the majority of days and it would affect your life. forgot your keys? forgot to turn in a paper? forgot your lunch on the counter? it was probably a mistake. it happens to everyone once in awhile. shake it off and set reminders. consistently forget your keys, to turn in a paper, or forget your lunch consistently? did you keep trying strategies to help, but you still consistently screw up like this? sounds like a disorder. you probably have adhd and should talk to someone. without long term strategies and/or medication, you'll be like a car stuck in the mud that's spinning its tires as fast as it can but doesn't go anywhere."
1918	47462	14	brzuwa	eohvjgb	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you think something's not quite right with someone, just ask. be a friend. i put a lot of effort into hiding my current mood, but if someone wants to help, i'm pretty much always willing to let them help me.
1919	47462	14	brzuwa	eohvjog	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	don't be afraid of us. show care and kindness to an ill person instead of trepidation and they will 100% appreciate it. take the time to make your own opinion of somebody before automatically accepting the harsh assumptions and stereotypes that are associated with a particular mental illness.

1922	47462	90	brzuwa	eohvulz	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	please don't say you have depression just because you feel sad once in a while. it's a real mental illness and not something teenagers should normalize to make themselves feel part of a smaller group of people. same goes for ocd. you don't have ocd if you want to arrange shit, ocd is far more serious than that.
1923	47462	14	brzuwa	eohviv7	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	mental illness is a sickness, just like how there are other forms of sicknesses, mental health is a sickness of the brain. we can't control what are mental illnesses do or don't do. we just do the best we can and hope for the best. and i will say this again, we cannot control our mental illnesses. that would be like telling someone to control the flu they have or the chicken pox(not the best examples, but the best i got got at 2 in the morning). trust us, if we could control it, we would. and for others who suffer from mental illness, you shouldn't be ashamed about it. it takes a lot of courage and willpower to have to go through the constant stuggle and still maintain a life. as someone who has mental illness(anxiety, ocd, and depression), i just want to say, we can't control it, and it is imaginary or make belief or something we are faking. it's real, it's real illnesses, and we cant just make it go away. and for any people with mental illness that has read my comment, and people just in general, i'll say exactly what i got tattooed on my arm: your story isn't over yet; i hope this will help others gain some insight into mental illness. i have examples for some, but right now i am too tired to type them out so if someone wants to hear them, let me know. and to everyone suffering, i want to say, keep fighting. better days will come your way, i know it :)

1925	47462	13	brzuwa	eohwmsi	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"it's no secret that some mental illnesses have been trivialised and even romanticised, but it's important to remember that there are what i call ""ugly"" sides of some mental illnesses. for example, and i'm a bit embarrassed to say this but, i have severe depression and it gives me a lack of motivation. this lack of motivation makes it very hard for me to be hygienic (i usually manage to pull through and be presentable when i need to be). i just wish i didn't have to feel embarrassed talking about this stuff. depression isn't just 'feeling sad'. it has a lot more baggage, and so do other mental illnesses."
1926	47462	24	brzuwa	eohxahn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you can have ptsd without ever having gone to war. my therapist is a combat veteran and im a sexual abuse survivor. we both have ptsd. were reading a book about trauma together. this book really destroyed the myth that civilians cant have ptsd and i wish i could just show it to every single person i meet. no matter *what* happened, the symptoms are almost the exact fucking same, just different triggers.
