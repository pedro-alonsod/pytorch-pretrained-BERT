784	52334	1105	bq2sd5	eo0w7ol	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	about 15 years ago, i worked as a deckhand on a line of boats that took people out to fort sumter. the trip was about an hour each way. one day, we were about halfway there and two teenagers decided it would be fun to jump off and try to swim to shore. this is in charleston harbor, which has a pretty solid tidal current, lots of boat traffic, and probably more sharks than one would like to think about. we ended up having to perform a water rescue on them. then continued on to the fort, with the coast guard coming and picking them up. all in all, an extreme act of stupidity.
785	52334	1111	bq2sd5	eo1ka97	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	led a scuba diving tour. while signing the safety waivers and all that one very old man kept telling us that he had a dnr ( do not resuscitate). we plainly told him that we are not bound to a dnr and if he passed out for any reason we would attempt to resuscitate by our safety training. pretty much all the divers are assuming this guy is gonna kill himself down there ( prob spit out the reg and go quietly into the night). dive happens, pretty much everyone is hawkeyed on this guy. i see him go behind a large coral head and lay down in the sand and spit out his reg. he is only at about 60 ft so i grab him and wrestle him to the surface. he will not take my back up regulator so i slam it against his mouth a purge air into his face. we get to the surface and he is fighting me non stop trying to pull all of his gear off. i throw a very hard punch to his jaw and knock him out ( actually trained to do this during dive rescues to keep the panicked person from killing you too) 3 weeks later and he tries to sue my dive shop and myself personally. tldr: guy tried to kill himself

"i used to do vineyard and garden tours for a pretty well known winery. i had a lady ask to see any merlot vines we had so i walked her over and she proceeded to dump ash all over them and yell ""we love you nana! rest in peace!"" needless to say you are not allowed to dump human remains on food goods."

788	52334	4139	bq2sd5	eo0ubww	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	used to be a tourguide at a primate sanctuary with a strict 'no touching policy'. at the end of the tour there's a suspension bridge, tourists go first, guide goes last as per the rules. i always warn the tourists that the other side is the territory of a hanuman langur and he doesn't fuck around, keep your distance etc. he doesn't attack people out of nowhere, but he likes showing his teeth and screaming, which scares tourists. anyway, one tour i get to the other side of the bridge, and a tourist got bitten. he says a monkey just bit him out of nowhere. asked the other tourists, no he tried to fucking pet the hanuman. dumbass got what he deserved
789	52334	2263	bq2sd5	eo0trp1	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	was on a tour in new orleans. guy gets drunk and basically makes a fool of himself and slaps his partner. everyone else on the tour is like whoa not cool, take a hike. gf leaves with him. next morning were all on the bus waiting to roll out to the next destination and were not moving. 30 minutes later were all getting pissed off, then the couple get on the bus looking sheepish. by the next stop we learn, the drunk guy ran a bath at the hotel, passed out and it flooded the bathroom, and four floors below into the hotel lobby. the hotel wouldnt let them leave without paying thousands of dollars. karma for him.
790	52334	6799	bq2sd5	eo0ub5j	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	on an open topped tour bus in london - woman tries to dangle her toddler over the railing, then starts saying she's going to complain to my manager when i told her to stop. caught her doing it again and company policy said that anyone endangering their kids like that was to be removed from the tour, so the driver had to come up and march her off. she still insisted she did nothing wrong. like, she literally had the kid's feet on the side rail of the (moving) bus and was just holding him loosely round the waist. one low hanging tree branch, of which there were many on the route, and that kid was gone.
791	52334	1622	bq2sd5	eo0v3ge	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide, but was doing an english language camp for foreign kids. took the kids on a day trip to london, which involved going up the london eye. while in the queue, one of the kids started shouting that he had a bomb in his bag and he was going to blow everyone up. almost got all 20 kids in the group kicked out.
792	52334	15708	bq2sd5	eo0uuzk	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was working on a tourist island in australia when this man pulled out almost all the back feathers of a peacock because he wanted to keep one. he sneaked up behind it, and grabbed a huge handful and yanked them all out. he was immediately escorted off the island. the peacock had a huge bare patch and most of its beautiful feathers were gone :(
793	52334	4399	bq2sd5	eo0teds	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	somewhat relevant, theres a small hill on a pedestrian footpath outside my university. once, i witnessed a segway tour attempt to use this path. the first segway slowed to a stop as it reached the top of this hill. the second segway sped up in an attempt to make it over, and crashed into the first segway. one by one, each segway crashed into the one in front of it, toppling over each other. the pathway now has a no bikes or segways sign.
794	52334	9153	bq2sd5	eo0sv4n	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i used to work at a heritage site. it was an old military installation with a lot of remaining original structures (bunk beds, cafeteria equipment, computers etc.). everyday it was a constant effort to remind people (read: kids) not to jump on the beds, not to slam doors open, not to punch every button like it owes them money. the absolute worst was a group of kids on a school trip. within the first ten minutes we're walking through the tech portion of the exhibit, where we had a wall lined with burroughs large systems machines (b5000's), all behind this little fence about waist-high. i turn to demonstrate some of the pieces, and when i look back at the group one of them had jumped over the barrier, opened one of the units and started pulling out handfuls of digital tape from the reels inside. i just about jumped on the kid when their teacher did just that. she jumped the barrier, smacked the kids hands and took him outside. i immediately ended the tour and had them all refunded, as i couldn't imagine what else could happen.
795	52334	4527	bq2sd5	eo0t6ix	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	they took a big shit in front of the group. so, we tour through streets and parks and make it really clear that the toilets at the beginning of the tour are the only ones for the first 90 minutes of tour. we get to a park about 30 mins into the tour. not a big park mind you, it is basically a big roundabout with a swing set, bench and two trees. i'm in the middle of my spiel in the park when i see a guy at the back of the group, step away, pull his pants down and squat on the grass. of course i was stunned and lost my flow which had everyone looking around only to recoil in horror as this guy drops a log like it was nothing. he wasn't even ashamed.
796	52334	23554	bq2sd5	eo0u076	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i work at a brewery tap room and take people on brewery tours. during fermentation co2 is produced and excess comes out through a run off pipe and into a water bucket. one of the attendees (who was being a pain and trying to be funny but nobody was laughing) asked me what the pipe was for, so i gladly explained. he then asked what would happen if he breathed it in. in disbelief of his stupidity i told him he would pass out/damage his brain, he then proceeded to grab the pipe and take a breath. he was then ejected and barred. some people are just beyond belief.
797	52334	8344	bq2sd5	eo0svdi	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	took a class of middle schoolers to a museum and one of my asshole students dragged his hand across a 3000 year old indian painting. later on i found out the object was almost certainly a reproduction but i nearly died of rage on the spot. edit: the student was with us on a 45 day placement for severe behavioral issues. he earned enough point in school to qualify for the field trip. never again.
798	52334	30661	bq2sd5	eo0vxb2	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked at a living history farm museum. i had a kid that was climbing on stuff the whole tour in the farm house and trying to get behind the smith in the blacksmith shop during a demo. after the tour when people are allowed to roam the grounds, i hear his mom screaming and look over to the barn and this kid has climbed the fence into the field with our long horn oxen and is trying to poke them with a stick. i walk over and calmly told him to get out of the field before our lazy oxen decide they've had enough, but this jack off decides to look me in the eye and smack ted on the ass with the stick like it's a riding crop. ted, bless him, just kinda jumps a little and whips his head around with a wtf dude look on his face. but seeing as he's a long horn, he just wipes this kid out with one of his horns when he turned his head. kid goes flying into the dirt and is having a melt down. mom is freaking out. i'm like dude, get the hell out of the pen before ted actually gets mad. so this kid is crying and trying to climb the fence out of the field and bill, who has been watching this whole thing waits until the kid is almost over the fence and walks up to him and nudges him in the ass with his nose and pushes him off the top of the fence. it was everything i could do to keep from laughing. kid was fine, ted was fine, but the kid and his mom were promptly kicked out of the museum. their dad and little sister were allowed to stay because she was well behaved and was just enjoying petting the goats at the petting zoo. so since the kid had to leave but his sister didn't there was a temper tantrum in the parking lot that could be heard all the way to the other side of the farm. but the oxen got some extra grain that night, so i guess they won in the end.
799	52334	290	bq2sd5	eo15ly7	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i work in the backcountry ski guiding industry, working my way to becoming a lead guide. guest are always trying to kill themselves but heres one that stands out . right now i mostly tail guide and pick people up when they fall , which is most of the time. one particularly deep day im sweeping a tree run and all of a sudden theres a man digging frantically in the snow towards a a pair of legs . his wife had fallen head first down slope in a flatish area. when she lawn darted the first half of her body was buried in the snow and only her legs and feet were visible. her husband thought it was a good idea to stand on top were her face obviously was and star digging near the exposed part of her body. i guess in the moment he forgot about human anatomy and where her head might be !? at this point i was maybe 3 minutes behind them so shed had her face under the surface for a while. i told him to stop and move , yelled  stop youre on her face , i tried added a couple expletives but nothing. i finally had to grab him by the backpack and power bomb him down the slope. i uncovered her face in under 10 seconds. she gasped for air , had a cry and then proceeded to tear that man to pieces verbally.

803	52334	10418	bq2sd5	eo0tn99	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"i'm in the middle of talking and someone's phone rings. ok, that happens sometimes, and usually they'd just cancel the call or step outside. nope, this guy answers the call and starts talking on the phone, only a few metres from where i'm standing. i think, 'oh he'll just quickly explain he's busy and end the call', nope! he starts a conversation. the rest of the group glare at him and i'm put in an awkward position because my workplace put a huge emphasis on politeness. so i suggest to him to continue his call in the hallway, just outside the room we were in, to which he replied 'no, i'm fine here', and went back to his phone conversation. i'm doing my best to talk to the rest of the group (about 25 people), but he's *so* loud! eventually this chinese woman yells across the room at him ""shut up, we want to listen to the lady, not you"" which worked. but i just couldn't imagine the nerve to ruin everyone's experience like that, cos you're too selfish to talk on the phone outside. also, the place i worked allowed photos but had a strict 'no photos of the staff' rule for privacy reasons. i always explained this at the start and 99% of people were cool. one day i had a particularly happy snapper who got right up in a staff members face to take a photo, like i'm taking centremetres from his face to take a photo. the staffer was just some rando middle aged white dude, so i'm not sure why the fascination, but he was livid. it's like i saw it happen in slow motion so couldn't do anything to stop it. that guy was removed from the tour."
804	52334	14269	bq2sd5	eo0s6st	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i had a guest, snorkeling try and grab the tail of a barracuda as he swam up behind it. luckily i was able to hit the guest with a dive fin from the boat to stop him before he got ahold. if he had grabbed on, im sure he would have been ripped to pieces by that fish.
805	52334	783	bq2sd5	eo0z34t	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i once was a tour guide in high school for a group of young chinese students coming to the rural us on a sort of fresh air trip. they told us beforehand that we had to keep the kids away from water because apparently parents dont value swimming lessons in china and there is such little open swimmable water that no one learns on their own. we were also told that the kids think swimming happens naturally  like if you go into water, youll immediately start swimming. anyways, one of our excursions was to a local reservoir and the plan was to hike up a hill nearby to overlook the reservoir lake, get a few photos, and then leave. when we got to the top, it started pouring rain like i had never seen before. im talking so much rain you cant see 5 feet in front of you. then lightning starts striking the lake and im still trying to keep it cool even though i had never been so close to lightning before. the students were taking it well and laughing, which was good, until they started running _directly for the lake_ and *jump in*. apparently they had also never learned about electricity conducting through water, so im freaking out and start pulling them out of the water (they werent in very far) and a couple of them complain that their phones were wet. in the rain. no one got hurt, but it was a crazy day. we got back on the bus and the kids started drinking liquor in the back (they ranged ages 9-16) and i had to bust them for that too. tl;dr: apparently chinese kids think swimming will just happen if you go in water, especially lightning-struck water
806	52334	19992	bq2sd5	eo0r5so	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	couple of guys i used to play cricket with went on a school trip to auschwitz and decided to steal a small pair of glasses and some buttons they found half buried in the ground. they were detained by polish police while they were leaving the site. hard to know what goes through peoples heads sometimes.
807	52334	530	bq2sd5	eo0u00a	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	tour guide at a university. we got a lot of guests that really, really dont want to be there. mostly misbehaved kids from a poor area of the city. we toured at all times, even during finals week. as many may know, sound can travel oddly in a in lecture centers. our lecture centers have windows around them, and like 6 kids thought it would be hilarious to smash on the windows. from the inside it sounds like gunshots are being shot from outside, or at least muffled gunshots. watched 100+ students flee the classroom during their final exam. we got a lot of shit for that. (it isnt easy corralling a group of 30+ students. thats the chaperones job!)
808	52334	5215	bq2sd5	eo0tyvk	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but i guess you could say i work in the tourism industry. i work ground crew for a company that does helicopter tours. number one rule for customers is dont walk under the tail boom, the rotor will kill you and it will hurt. its unbelievable how many people have a death wish out there. people see the fastest way to the other side of the helicopter and dont stop to think oh hey, that spinning blade may or may not slice my whole fucking head off lets see how close we can get to it!
809	52334	4913	bq2sd5	eo0uf02	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	tour guide/boat captain in the caribbean. we had about 40/50 people on the boat, got off. we would normally go feed swimming pigs which someone would get nipped from them from doing stupid shit but nothing too serious. well the next stop after that was another island where we would hand feed turtle, sharks, and stingrays. so we would tell the people to hold it with the the palm open and food in the middle for the stingrays and they would come over the top and take it out. the turtles and the sharks put it in the water holding it in the tips and when they are coming for it let go. well of course, this dingus decided he would be tough and feed this baby shark, no longer than your forearm without letting go. shark proceeds to bite his fingers, he screams and jumps up out of the water and flicks it off of his hand, pulling one of his finger nails off in the process. so that's one i always remember.
810	52334	257	bq2sd5	eo0weiy	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not my story, but co-worker's story. he was a tour manager for south america. we tend to work with the more older travelers (60ish and above). him and his guests were flying from lima to cuzco, peru which is about 10,000ft in elevation. this is a group of around 40ish travelers. apparently, he had one male guests who had ibs or something, and while in mid-flight shat himself. the stench was unbearable as they are all in a small aircraft carrier taking them to cuzco so high in the mountains. he said he had to help escort this guy to the bathroom in the back, but as he stood up, the shit just came down his leg. so now, he's dragging shit with him to the toilet. once he got to the toilet, he cleaned it up with the assistance of the aircraft attendant. he was very embarrassed, but not as embarrassed as the guy who poo'ed himself. once they landed, this guy who shat himself is in the bathroom, apologetic, and was cleaning himself up. the guide went into the airport and bought him some new peruvian style pants and then came back to the airport to help dress this guy in the bathroom. i would say that was probably one of the worst stories i have heard happen to an individual. i have also heard of a fellow co-worker who guides tourism in vietnam, had to bail out a tourist from jail one time. she received a phone call in the middle of the night from him, in jail, asking for help. she showed up and ask the man, what happened? the vietnamese police said he was caught purchasing viagra and exchanging money for prostitution.
811	52334	3825	bq2sd5	eo0tvqo	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i used to give tours at my university. there was a group of middle schoolers i was giving a tour to (to show them why they should want to go college.yatta yatta). there was this one kid who kept trying to sneak away and was whistling at just about every girl who walked by. weird. okay, whatever, he thinks he's a big shot. then a very attractive girl comes jogging by us, and he tried to grab her and starts air humping while he watches her run away from us. i was mortified. i ended the tour. i was done with him. the teachers didn't even care, that was probably the worst part.
812	52334	3845	bq2sd5	eo0s9qo	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	didn't happen to me, but one of my company's tour guides was on a flight with a bunch of middle schoolers. one of the boys got caught jerking it. in his seat. next to a girl who wasn't even from his school.
813	52334	19255	bq2sd5	eo0woln	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	my cousin is a tourist guide and biologist, most of his tours are in africa. he instructed his group of 20-25 people including kids not to wear any type of earrings or collars especially shiny stuff since they were about to go into a thick forest to try to see a bunch of animals. this is very important because 20-25 make a lot of noise which makes wild animals run away or hide, it's even worse if they're wearing shiny stuff they can spot from far away. ok so this woman complains, decides to wear shiny earrings anyway, cousin tells her to get rid of them or she ain't coming with the group so she obeys but puts them on a bit later. some species of monkeys in that area love shiny stuff. they ripped the earrings from her ears. edit: ok i wasn't ready for the inbox nukes. yes my username makes everyone cringe. shaving your teeth is a truly enlightening experience! make sure to sleep properly so you don't wake up too tired and end up picking your razor instead of your toothbrush when you brush/shave your teeth :d

"i was on a tour with my family in cambodia and we visited angkor wat. now as everyone knows, angkor wat is teeming with tourists day and night. there was a long line to climb the bakan (basically the topmost tower, wherein the steps are very steep). it was a hot day and when it was almost our turn, a middle-aged man took two steps, fell backward and started having a seizure. people came to his help immediately. however, one man who was also crowding around him did nothing but pull out his cellphone and start recording. thankfully, everyone noticed and started yelling at the guy to put that shit away. he acted like the victim though and he said he was ""just trying to help"". what a twat. edit: people are saying the guy was probably filming it to show paramedics but a) the victim's family was there and if anyone had the right to collect evidence, it's them and b) recording dude was grinning widely until he was called out so i seriously doubt he had good intentions despite his claims."
815	52334	11137	bq2sd5	eo0tovs	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was giving a tour of my university to the mother of a potential student. she tried to recruit me into a popular pyramid scheme and then, when i tried to change the subject by asking what she did in her spare time, she told me about her conspiracy theories that she gives public talks on. they included the dangers of wi-fi, 5g, and *chemtrails*, and that the moon landings were faked by stanley kubrick, who was shortly thereafter assassinated by the cia and *replaced by a clone*. i cut the tour short. felt pretty sorry for her daughter who appeared to think these theories were reasonable and had also been recruited into her mother's pyramid scheme at 17.

819	52334	13930	bq2sd5	eo0t7ct	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	we're pretty good at stopping tourist from doing too much damage. after being in the industry for a while you get a spidey sense for when people are going to do dumb things and can often steer them away from doing anything too bad. that being said, here's one of my favourite stories to tell. i was 7 months pregnant and it was the week before i went on maternity leave. i was driving out to one of our sites and to get there i had to drive (on the road of course) through our penguin colony. this particular species of penguin burrows underground and stays hidden in their burrow during the day, and comes out at night when birds of prey and other potential predators have gone to sleep. as i'm driving out to the site i realise the parking lot up ahead is full and people have started parking up and down the road. and that's when i see a giant suv pull off the road, drive between the bollards and into the penguin colony. i pull over as what seems like 20 non-english speaking tourists start to pile out of the vehicle and take selfies with the ocean backdrop. staying as calm as possible and using sign language i point out the no entry signs of the bollards they drove past, the burrows they have just collapsed, inform them they may have killed penguins, and to get their fucking vehicle out of the fucking colony. once i got them out of there i started digging out the collapsed burrows to check for penguins. the first four were luckily empty but the last one had a breeding pair. i get the girl out, check her over for injuries, and having no where else to put her i follow protocol and tuck her under my left arm against my side. i get the boy out and put him in the same position on the right side and start to check him over. remember how i said i was pregnant? well normally, you hold a penguin down low almost on your hip, but because of my round tummy i was holding him more at the bottom of my ribcage. so when i turned my head to start my health check, the bastard reached up and grabbed my top lip with his beak and ripped straight through the middle. it was about this time that the tourists walking along the road realised this ranger was holding onto two penguins. i had five or six tourists sprint through the colony towards me and start snapping pictures. while at the same time potentially collapsing more burrows. if any internet sleuths stumble across a picture of a heavily pregnant, pissed off looking ranger, holding two penguins with blood pouring down her face let me know. i've been waiting for that picture to show up for 3 years and haven't found it yet. happy ending, i chased away the photographers, popped the two uninjured penguins in a nearby unoccupied burrow, and radioed for back up to help with the parking situation. my lip healed without a scar, and both penguins left the following morning for a well deserved day in the ocean. tl;dr signage is there for a reason. rules are there for a reason. if you don't know what the reason is, doesn't mean you should break the rules. edits: real tl;dr tourists drove over penguin burrows. no penguins were harmed in the making of this story. just. glad people seem to appreciate the work we do with these super cute (vicious, and smelly) animals. they're worth every ounce of blood, sweat and tears!

822	52334	4856	bq2sd5	eo0rnnj	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was a tour guide for my college on open day. i was leading a group of prospective students and parents, and there was one bunch who didn't appear to have any teenagers with them and spoke only chinese. whatever, maybe they're applying as mature students. my college is pretty obsessive about the lawns. there's only one lawn you're even allowed to walk on (no food, drinks or music allowed though), all the rest carry a 5 fine if you get caught. so we're walking around the lawn on the path, and the chinese group start wandering onto the lawn and away from the tour. i try to bring them back, but they don't seem to understand. another parent asks a question and i have to move on with the tour. we come back around to the lawn a few minutes later and they've set up a small tent and are hammering tent pegs into the perfectly manicured grass. one lady is picking flowers from the flowerbeds. i called security and when they grabbed a passing chinese student to translate that this was unacceptable, the visitors started screaming at the poor guy. they had to be kicked out by police.

"i wasn't the tour guide but i was on a tour of namibia and had a zimbabwean guide who was telling us his craziest stories. he had a couple that was married who were on their honeymoon who were on one of his trips. one night, everyone is sitting around the fire and chatting (just as we were) and this couple gets up to go to the bathroom. this is a campsite so they walk off into the darkness towards the toilets. a few minutes later the guy runs back alone, crying and panicking. everyone asks him what happened. ""i think my wife was killed by a lion."" gasp, shock. everyone is freaked out, asking him what happened, and as he's trying to explain, the now-irate wife walks up to the campsite and starts yelling. so what had happened? well, they'd walked off, and at some point near the toilets, they both heard a kind of snuffling noise in the underbrush, clearly an animal rooting around. the husband completely freaks out, pushes his wife towards the noise and *down to the ground*, screams, and runs away. spoiler alert, it was not a lion and the wife was not pleased at the attempts at being sacrificed. the guide told us that they didn't speak the entire rest of the trip and they he believes they got divorced. hilarious. tl;dr; don't shove your wife into the ground if you think there is a hungry lion in the underbrush just to save yourself. edit: because mobile."
824	52334	6637	bq2sd5	eo0tsuo	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	was at a reptile show and they let out some mini crocodile iguana type thing. i think it was called a dragon something? anyway some kid decides to take his shoe off and wiggle his toes through the small rope gate we were against. presenter says watch your kid, these will bite. kid removes his foot and immediately puts it back in when presented turns around, wiggles his toes again, and this dragon thing *surges* forward and clamps down. kid starts screaming, presenter just looks on like well i told you so and removes it. kid stops screaming, no-one says anything, and presenter moves on. thats what you get for ignoring instructions, and also for not parenting properly. **edit: okay guys i really doubt it was a komodo dragon since the presenter really wasnt worried about it, please stop commenting saying the kid is dead or something. as others have pointed out it was probably a monitor, a chinese water dragon, or a bearded dragon. it was big enough so a monitor sounds correct. i dont need anyone else commenting about whether it was a komodo dragon and whether the kid got help or not. his sock almost came off and he got a fright, thats all, kid was fine**

827	52334	622	bq2sd5	eo0um59	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was a tour guide at a historic village museum (similar to colonial williamsburg). the worst thing was the blatant sexual harassment by some older male visitors towards our female guides (some who obviously look under 16) who wear the old fashioned dresses. you'd be surprised how many men on group tours openly ask our staff members to show them what's under their dress, talk about how it used to be acceptable to marry girls under 16 and how they wish it was still acceptable, or make pretty gross sexual remarks about our staff members in front of the group and i. when you would call them out on their behavior as being inappropriate they would act like you were wrong for getting offended by it and that we should accept it since we were demonstrating life in the 18th century. i heard and saw some pretty bad stuff which would make both the other guests and staff uncomfortable. it also wasn't uncommon for people to sneak away from the tour group to go into restricted areas in an attempt to hunt the ghosts which are supposedly on the property. theres a reason those places are out of bounds, there can be irreplaceable artifacts we don't want accidentally damaged, tools, or the area hasn't been cleared by the fire marshal to allow guest access. small things have been broken by people doing this. people love to get confrontational about being told they can't go into restricted areas or touch the artifacts despite all the signs hung up.

830	52334	9239	bq2sd5	eo0v3ga	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	during my summers in college, i worked as a raft guide on a whitewater river in the southeast. it wasnt a difficult job; the two biggest things we were responsible for were running our trips in a timely manner and ensuring that the guests in our boat had a fun and safe trip down the river. the safety part is important, because people visiting the river frequently forget that it is a natural wilderness feature and carries all of the associated dangers. we frequently received questions about whether the rafts were on tracks, whether i actually had to do anything in the back, and (my personal favorite) whether the river went in a circle and we would end up back where we started. this last question was particularly funny because we took a bus from the rafting outpost to the put-in of the river  why bother if we were going in a circle?! one summer afternoon, i had a boat with three groups of two people; one of those groups was a mother and son. the mother seemed nice, if timid, as did the son. however, as i was going through the routine of explaining the safety concerns and paddle commands, it started to dawn on me that he was not very bright. there was nothing wrong with him  he was just dumb as shit. once we were on the river, he almost immediately developed a habit of checking the depth of the water with his paddle. he would incessantly plunge the blade into the water without care nor concern for his surroundings and circumstances. the water on this river is pristine. almost crystal clear. the riverbed is visible almost constantly, and still, this young man felt the need to verify the veracity of his own eyeballs by shoving his paddle into the river like some sort of deranged perpetual motion machine. of course, i warned him against his actions. at first, my concerns were that his depth-checking interferes with his ability to follow my commands and paddle. eventually, however, my pleading grew more desperate as it dawned on me that this child paid no deference to my authority. he answered only to chaos. it finally came to a head when, in a portion of the river that was extremely shallow (probably no more than a foot deep), he plunged his paddle into the riverbed with a force that shook the surrounding countryside. like excalibur, the paddle wedged itself among the rocks, perfectly erect. the boy, with a staid iron grip that could only be wielded by someone incredibly dense, kept his hand on the paddle as the rushing water carried us away from its new location. in one swift motion, he was wrenched from the raft and landed in a foot of water. he wore a face of bewildered idiocy. it was quite satisfying to keep his paddle in the back with me for the remainder of the trip after i returned him safely to the raft. all he could do was stare wistfully at the riverbed, his poo brain longing to verify its depth.

"i'm a guide for a popular mainstream brewery. the way tours work there, we always have two guides per tour: one leading and one closing the group, for safety reasons. when we greet people, part of our spiel consists in pointing out the fact that the only toilets are located at the entrance - so right where we are standing at the moment - and the pub at the end of tour. we also make it very clear that no one should at any point be behind the closing guide, no matter what. both of these will be important later on. so, on the day this happened, the other guide and i were alternating between leading and closing. we greeted our group of ~25 people and noticed there was a little boy of around 4 there with his parents. this wasn't the first time something of the sort happened, but i'll never understand why people feel the need to bring their children and even babies to a brewery. much less one that is advertised as being difficult to walk around. oh well. we leave with our group and everything is fine until we reach the brew room. at this point, while my colleague is explaining the beer making process, the father approaches me saying that his son needs the toilet. i tell him that we are close to the pub and ask if he can wait five minutes so we could all leave the brew room together, or if he'd rather the three of us leave for the pub immediately and rejoin the group later on. he answers ""nevermind"" and rejoins the group. after a minute or so, i hear the door to the room opening and closing, this is a big no-no of course, because we need to always be aware of where everyone is. so, i go to investigate and find the father holding his son while he pees around the corner. fml"

853	52334	124	bq2sd5	eo0y67m	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was an educator in a museum and we had a summer camp for middle school kids. one day we got to take them on a tour of the roof where we had a garden and a cool view. it was 9 stories up. some of the boys were tossing gravel over the sides so i had to hover near them to get them to behave. then as we were waiting for the single elevator to head down, this big boy (he was probably no more than 11 but was the size of a 16 year old) decides he doesnt wanna wait for the elevator anymore. he grabs the outer doors and pries them open. fortunately, elevator doors are two layers for this very reason. we were not looking down the elevator shaft, but at another set of doors. but that caused the elevator to be unable to open on our level. so then i had to take a group of 20 rowdy 11 year olds down 9 flights of stairs. overall at that job i gave museum tours to hundreds of groups of kids and their parents and without a doubt i can say the parents were more trouble than the kids.

855	52334	236	bq2sd5	eo0xb3e	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but i was on a tour of auschwitz a few months ago. as you can imagine it's a very solemn place. because it's the final resting place of so many people, they ask visitors to stay respectful throughout the whole place - no selfies, no joking, no phones, no talking above a whisper, even no talking at all in some areas. because of this the whole place has has a very somber feel, almost like a funeral. &#x200b; a group from another european country that was going round at the same time of us didn't follow these rules. they were shouting to each other while walking around the concentration camp, talking on their phones, one guy through his gum on the floor, talking loudly even inside one of the still standing gas chambers (where ask you to be the most respectful), taking photos of each other posing outside the gas chamber, barbed wire fences and other macabre backdrops. when a tour guide would ask them to stop, they would for a time and then resume. &#x200b; it was an infuriating experience. our tour guide said that unfortunately it happens all the time and groups from that country specifically are the worst offenders. she'd personally had to stop a picnic on a grassy patch outside of the gas chamber.

"i was a university tour guide (oddly enough today is reunion), anyway, one time i was giving a tour, and we got to the central quad of campus, which contains a statue of freud reading a book. as i'm in the middle of my spiel about the history of the square we are in and the history of our psych department, this one woman in the crowd seems transfixed on the book of the statue and is giggling. i glance over and notice what appears to be a log of human shit (by the size it was either human or a very large dog). i try to ignore it and keep my composure/to my script, internally praying that nobody says anything or asks me to explain. within a minute the one woman who was giggling starts moving her hand. i still remember that moment in slow motion as she reaches out, and without flinching just picks the shit up in her bare hands. i stop what i am saying in mid-sentence and i am just a deer in headlights at this point. the woman then looks up at me and in an oddly high pitched voice asks ""is this a poopie?"". i am now double stunned, hit with a one-two punch. i think it takes me a good 30 seconds to even physically react or respond to what just transpired. somehow my wiring resets and i go back into tour-guide mode, and i just as calmly as possible say ""maam i don't know what that is, but i suggest you don't touch it. if you would like to wash your hands we will be passing restrooms on our way to our next stop"". flash forward 4 or 5 years, post-college. i'm at a party with friends most of whom were from my college days, including a couple who i really didn't get closer to until after we graduated. well at this party we're telling stories of and reminiscing about some of our wilder exploits and one of my newer friends starts telling about how one of her friends from home was visiting for the weekend, got absolutely blasted on cheap vodka and thought it would be ""cool"" to take a steamer right down the spine of the book freud was holding. i stopped laughing. 2 and 2 had finally come together. i stopped her and asked ""what year was this? what month?"". she replied and it fit. that's when i said ""oh shit, it *was* a poopie"" and my older friends and i started cracking up. it this point we had to fill in new friend the above story, and how now we finally knew it was in fact a ""poopie"" and in fact was human."

"i was a horse touring guide for 7 years and the shit i had ro deal with was ridiculous. the most xommon nonsense was wanting to have them and their 7 year old children run on the horses. they would purposfully smack the horses butt that their kid was on to get the horse to run. but the worst was a bus load full of asian tourists (12) came to ride. only one of them spoke english and he was about 9 years old. every time one of the girls got on a horse they would cry. i already knew this next hour to hour and a half was going to be hell so i decided to put a lead rope on the horse the kid who could translate was riding, and i had him stay with me the entire time. (there was another guide in the front) when we got out to the forest the kids father demanded that we stopped. he wanted me to take a picture of all of them after they got to the top of this super steep mountain. he starts kicking and smacking his horse and he is yelling at all of his family members to do the same before the kid even finishes translating what his father said. i asked the kid to tell them to stop. tell them no. the kid is trying but they are all turning up this hill and not listening. now these horses were well trained and mannered but they also will listen even though they have been trained to stay in line. so the father gets his horse going up this hill and smacks his horses butt one more time and his horse takes off up this mountain. idk if anyone has watched how a horse runns up a mountain but the almost hop. its not easy to stay on. the worst part is, about 7 of the 12 horses follow suite and start running up this mountain. the other guide and i look at one another in panic mode as all these peoples screams are fading up this hill. thankfully the other guide and i can think quick. she grabs the few remaining horses that didnt run as all of their riders are also screaming and crying and yelling. i decide i need the translator boy to stay with me so i tell him what i am going to do, how to hold on and i ask him if he thinks he can do it so we can go stop all these horses. he nods leans forward and holds on as i get both are horses running up the hill. when i reach the top 4 of the older horses had slowed down and were eating so i tell the boy to tell them to get off the horses. he replies they dont know how and are too scared i (try not to show my irritation) jump off my horse as i tell him to give them my instructions step for step. he does but they all shake their heads as they are death gripping the horn. thank god asians are usually light and small. i basicaly had to lift/drag them off of the horses. i told them all to start walking down the hill and go with the others. i tied up their horses to the nearest tree asked the boy to hold on tight again and took off looking for the others. i finally found a younger man and his wife(?) she was covered in pine needles with a few scratches on her arms and covered in dirt. the boy (i assume) asks what happened then tells me her horse went under a tree and she didnt fit. the mans horse was behind hers so it stopped barely missing her and he got off to help her. i again told them to start walking and i tie up his horse. so now i have 2 missing horses and 1 missing tourist. it took me and that boy 40 min to finally catch up and find his father. this poor boy was so embarrassed and worried and when we finally catch up to him and his horse and the riderless horse trailing behind he looks up and says ""ya, real cowboys now! huh son."" i grabbed this dudes reigns and told his son to tell him to get off of his horse now! i told him to follow us and have him walk behind my horse, his sons horse and the now 2 riderless horses tied in a pack line. the father was angry and kept talking to his son but his son was so mad at him he would not reply or even look back at him. the poor kids face was so red. the other guide had managed to get all the other riders and horses back to the stable by the time we got back and when i pulled that kid off of his horse i looked him in the eyes and i told him how thankful i was for him and how brave he was. i told him to stay strong and to hold his chin high because he did the right thing. i told him he was a hero and an excellent rider because that was a lot for a 9 year old kid to handle for his first time on a horse. that day was an unforgetable nightmare. but that kid was a champion."

882	52334	352	bq2sd5	eo0x9ks	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in amsterdam as a pub crawl guide for 6 months a couple years ago. a normal night we could have between 50 and 80 people, however during the summer those numbers double. so one night we're still at the start point before the crawl starts and a big group of lads come to join. they were on a stag and clearly out for a mad one. the crawl would start with an hour of cheap beers and free shots from the guides, these lads tore through our supplies. as we start, they're all already pretty smashed but aside from being loud, they're fine. as the crawl progresses however, some of them started disappearing and reappearing. we would always warn the pub crawlers to not buy drugs from street dealers but we were busy with guiding and aren't babysitting anyone (unless they need it and i'd get them water and a safe way to where ever they needed to go). it's about the 4th pub (out of 6) and it's clear the lads on the stag are buzzing. half are smiling so brightly that you'd swear there was a literal supernova of lightbulbs going off in their heads, the other half are drooling through the smiles and gurning. it's at this point that shit took off. suddenly one of the lads had a massive stuffed eagle. he didn't have it at the beginning but now we had about 30 lads off their tits bowing and praising a massive stuffed eagle that one is holding over his head. one of the other lads shouts that they need to make an offering, and then throws his pint at it. this generates a huge laugh and then the lads all shower the eagle with booze. everyone is in hysterics at this point. then the first glass was smashed. i think it was an accident, but the next 30 glasses smashing wasn't. the lads went fucking insane, they started throwing chairs around the place and smashing glasses. a few fights break out as there's a bunch of other people in this pub who aren't taking their shit. amid the chaos, the guy with the eagle is still standing in the middle holding it up and beseeching everyone to be calm like the eagle. so at this point, the other guides and i looked at each other and shrugged and started moving the rest of the pub crawlers along, keeping all these people here wasn't going to help the situation. so we continued, until a few of the lads caught up down the street a bit. they tried to start a fight with a random passerby, but two of them got cleanly knocked out by the guy before the others backed down. more shit i have to deal with, so i tell my buddy to keep the crawl going and i called the ambulance. once the two lads were taken care of i took off and finished the crawl. the shittiest thing is what happened afterwards. one of the two lads, once arriving at the hospital, immediately took off and walked away, refusing help. the police picked him up and seeing he was fucked up, took him back to the hospital. he ran again, and again they picked him up and brought him in. they warned him that if he ran off again then he'd be sleeping it off in a cell, but of course he ran again. some point during the night this fella died in the cell of an overdose. he had taken some shite from a street dealer and was one of many who had died from some white powder heroin that was being sold as cocaine. tl;dr: died.
883	52334	78	bq2sd5	eo14ev3	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	former horse trail guide. group of 6 on the trail, plus me at the rear for safety and our leader up ahead. the ride was a faster ride, meant to be for people who already had some experience riding and wanted excitement. old witch (ow) and her grandson of about 12 (gs) were 2 of the riders. ow disregards all safety rules from minute 1. we ask them to ride in single file and not overtake each other as horses tend to fight when they think theyre being overtaken. ow wanted to go both in front and behind of her gs and wouldnt take no for an answer. for the first 20 minutes she repeatedly kicked her horse forward and then took a photo, and then took him back behind gs. both horses were getting upset and gs was getting frightened because he did not have any riding skills at all and his horse was getting alarmed. this conversation happened: me: maam please keep your horse in its place in the line. your grandsons horse is getting upset and he isnt enjoying the ride because of that. ow: how long have you been riding? how old are you? me: im 18 and ive been riding for 12 years ma-am. ow: well ive been riding 40 years. thats a bit longer, dont you think? me: im sorry but these are our horses and im responsible for your grandsons safety. it isnt safe to keep overtaking him. she stopped the shenanigans for a bit. then we got to the fast part of the ride. theres a fire break - a long sand track by a fence - that we always used for a fast run. the horses knew it and rarely needed more than a little kick to go fast there. ow was behind gs at this point after finally stopping with her photographs. we stop before the fast part for a safety instruction which consists of you dont have to make the horse go fast, it will follow the leader, but feel free to give it a kick if it doesnt, and remember to lean back not forward, and try not to overtake. i swear to god ow looked back at me and smirked as my coworker said those words. ow was on a lovely, responsive horse. we would use this horse when 5 or 6 year old children were on beginner rides and he never ever played up. as soon as they got onto the fast strip, she literally booted him so loud that i could hear it like a drum. the horse was afraid and fucking took off at top speed - barrelling through the other riders, including ows grandson. two other riders had their horses swerve into tree branches and were knocked off. she put literally every person in the ride in danger. her grandson fell off. i helped him back up and he was crying and too afraid to even start going again, so i had to put him behind me, and ow in front of me so that ow could not possibly fuck up his horse any more. she then proceeded to ask my name and tell me she would get me fired. this made my day because i worked for my mum and also i had been fired literally 2 days earlier in an argument with my mum and i was back because she needed me. ow seemed pissed that i didnt care one bit. she never did complain about me though and her grandson was so sweet and really appreciated being behind me and not subject to her horse upsetting his. i felt so bad for the kid.

889	52334	132	bq2sd5	eo0x2rd	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in museums for ten years and saw plenty of horrors, usually kids being left to jump all over everything. i've tried to block much of it out but here are a few i remember;  a man loudly talking to his grandson about the exhibits in a very pompous tone who turned to me at a case of delicate 16c pieces, asking how he could open the case. wtf? oh yeah! take my keys and get your big maulers over everything why don't you! a broken china cup shoved into a drawer in the childrens edwardian style play kitchen. i was tidying up and the jagged pieces almost tore my inner arm open. a lady looking on as her grandson clambered all over a very expensive sculpture in the gallery which was part of a contemporary exhibition. i stood alongside her for a few moments, smiling sweetly and said 'lovely piece isn't it? a real investment at 30k' she soon got the little crotchgoblin out of it then. people complaining about the lighting in the gallery. each set of lights had to be set to particular levels depending on the piece it was shining on. 'i'm an artist myself and it takes hours to get the colours just right. what's the point if you can't see it properly?' well if you're an artist, flower, you'll know all about light damage won't you? on one occasion we had an amazing pre-raphaelite painting on loan. no guards, no barrier-you could get up close and personal to it-it was amazing! yep, you've guessed it. we had someone whinge the lighting then. i explained the reasoning and that the light levels were a condition of the loan and the insurance, but no. her needs are far more important than the conservation of a silly old painting. people trying to donate actual rubbish to the collections-connect four with half the pieces missing, that kind of thing-and getting very arsey when we politely thanked them for their trouble and advised that 'we actually already have one of those'. a teacher with absolutely no control over her class who were running around *screaming* and smacking into cases. in fact, i saw a couple of bullies with a little boy shoved up against one of the cases. this was a really small museum too, so it's not like she can't have noticed. when i spoke with her about it she did the 'children! behave or the lady is going to make us all leave!' no wonder she had no control if she never took any responsibility. finding a drug addict in a jacobean four poster bed because 'they were tired'. there are loads more, but these are the ones i can remember. i guess they seem pretty minor, but when you get the same scenario over and over, there's definitely cumulative frustration which lead to lower tolerance of the public!

912	52334	52	bq2sd5	eo1urcn	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	college tour guide at the biggest medical school in the state. this girl was top of her class, had a full ride, everything laid out for her. were touring the anatomy labs as a group, the room is full of cadavers in body bags. its a creepy room. she asks can i take a selfie with one of them? i told her absolutely not, these were people and that would be incredibly disrespectful to them and their families. she nods like she understands, then when i turn my back, she unzips a bag, picks the guys head up, and snaps a selfie. obviously she was immediately removed from campus and her acceptance to medical school was revoked. the university was going to stop there, but she tagged the school in her instagram pic with the cadaver. they then notified every medical school in the country what she did. shell never be a doctor, all because of one selfie.
