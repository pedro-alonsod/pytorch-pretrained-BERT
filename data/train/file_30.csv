6771	27417	670	bntob1	en95dfn	what movie really changed an actor's career?	obviously heath ledger passed shortly afterwards, but his role as the joker was a massive turning point in the eyes of a lot of people. one forgets he was widely *not* anticipated to be that good for the role before the film came out. it is of course amongst the best performances ever. he'd have gone on to do amazing things i'm sure of it.
