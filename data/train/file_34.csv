3778	39097	9581	bp9xm7	enqyvfj	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	real live bus driver here! only been driving for 2 years though. as said already on here we all wish passengers would have their form of payment ready as it slows us down a hell of a lot when you don't. more importantly for me though is don't give me death stares or even a smart arse comment because the bus is late. i pride myself on being on time as much as possible and having good statistics on kpi's so when i'm not on time it's because of shitty traffic, time consuming interactions with people or an impossible schedule.
3779	39097	1909	bp9xm7	enqyvwh	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i'm not a bus driver but i wish people would stop throwing/leaving trash in the bus, i'm tired of picking it up
3780	39097	9428	bp9xm7	enqr62g	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	my dad isn't a commercial bus driver, but a school one. if them kids could just sit in front like he asked that'd be great.
3781	39097	29378	bp9xm7	enqna8t	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	theyre not answering because their do not speak to the driver sign is up
3782	39097	124	bp9xm7	enr7g0o	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	school bus driver here. please stay seated, i sometimes have to apply the (breaks) brakes and if you are standing or switching seats you could be injured. which means i have paperwork to do. don't throw rubbish on the floor. i have to clean it up. teachers on charters: at the end of your trip, don't spend ten minutes on the bus talking to your students. get off the bus. i have places to go. and thank you for checking the bus for rubbish your students left. yes, i do like gift cards.
3783	39097	21513	bp9xm7	enqqwfg	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"* signal clearly when waiting at the stop that you want my bus - i can't read your mind or stop on a sixpence when you wave frantically at the last minute (if the bus stop says request stop, then you have to request the bus to stop!) * have you pass/fare ready before boarding, especially if the bus is stuck in the traffic waiting to serve the bus stop, you can see the bus is there so don't wait until you're at the driver to route through your bag or do the pocket strip tease. * if you have young kids please keep them seated. i don't mind crying, singing or loud kids, but kids running around the bus means that i will pull up at the next safe point and won't move until you either seat them or remove yourself and them from the bus. * if you need extra time to get seated or for me to lower the bus just ask. the extra 20-30 seconds it will take is nothing compared to the paperwork we have to fill out if you have an accident on the bus. * please don't crowd the doors if there is room on the bus, it causes delays as people getting on and off have to push past you - and i will request you to take a seat if there is one. * if you have a question for me please ask when getting on, not when i'm driving, also don't expect me to be an oracle and getting pissed because i don't now where every side street or pub is. edit - thanks for the gold, and to clarify the first point which has rubbed some people the wrong way - at every bus stop that i approach i check the stop and around it for ""intending passengers"", if you're nonchalantly sitting there playing on your phone in a world of you own chances are i'll go past you, but if you look like you want my bus i'll stop. i will stop at any bus stop with a person with a cane, guide dog, wheelchair or mobility aid or a crowded bus stop. in london most bus stops service several routes at once and my bus route is a high frequency route (a bus every 4 minutes during the peak). my point of signalling clearly means that i don't have to read between the lines and i can be certain that somebody wants my bus at that particular stop."
3784	39097	37977	bp9xm7	enr0jsa	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i wish they knew i have the power to kill them all
3785	39097	1509	bp9xm7	enr4iwp	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	its been said already, but to reiterate: 1. ring the bell, pull the cord, push the button (however it works on your bus) for your stop at least a block or two before we actually get to the stop . and even if its a stop we will make anyway. drivers cant read your minds, so signaling will let us know you want to get off the bus. signaling as we pass your stop is pointless, because. 2. buses cant stop on a dime! dont step out in front of a bus and expect us to stop safely for you. also, after getting off the bus, dont cross in front of us! either cross behind us or wait for us to pass. its too easy for us to run you over. 3. if you see your bus at your stop, board quickly. we are on a schedule and cannot wait around for everyone to lollygag their way to the stop. hurry up and get to the bus. youre holding up the bus and everyone on it. 4. if youre the only one standing at a stop served by multiple routes and im a bus that you *dont* want, signal to me that you dont want my bus so i dont have to waste my time stopping for you. shake your head, turn away from us, step away from the stop, or something. 5. buses are not taxis. we have routes, schedules, and designated stops. if you are on the street in between stops and see a bus you need or want, dont flag them down and expect them to stop for you. many times our policies dont permit us to stop anywhere except a designated bus stop. 6. we are most likely not the last bus that will ever service your stop. so if you miss your bus, or if we leave before you make it to the stop, dont try to sprint to catch up with us. wait for the next one! and if you really need to catch my bus at that very moment, be on time to the stop! 7. when the bus is crowded, please move as far back as you can to allow people to get on the bus. there is no stigma to sitting in the back of the bus. 8. when exiting the bus, use the back doors unless you need special attention offboarding, e.g., if youre in a wheelchair, use a walker, or otherwise require us to kneel the bus (which can only be done at the front). 9. when boarding a bus with a special needs passenger who is offboarding, wait for them to get off and clear the bus before you push your way on. 10. be considerate of other people! this is not your personal limousine. this is public space. not everyone wants to watch you eat or hear your music or watch your videos. 11. if you clip your nails on my bus, i will kick you the fuck off it. that is just plain disgusting. take care of your personal hygiene in a proper bathroom somewhere else! 12. if you need help with anything, especially route information, never hesitate to ask the driver. nine times out of ten, they will be happy to help. 13. but please dont distract us for too long. we cant be your therapist and safely operate the bus at the same time. (nor would many of us want to.) 14. we are people too, not your servants, so please be kind and courteous to us. we may be in a service position, but that doesnt mean we have to take your shit. 15. this is a large vehicle, not a jungle gym. find a seat and sit in it. do not swing yourself from the bars. if you cannot sit down, hold on to something! this list is way longer than i thought it would be!
3786	39097	11677	bp9xm7	enqna5j	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i used to be a bus driver years ago. i usually found other drivers far more annoying than passengers, but one thing i disliked was when a long line of people would get on and each ask where the bus was going. like, a) there's a sign on the outside of the bus that tells you this, and b) you *just* heard ten other people ask that question and get exactly the same answer. edit: i think a lot of you are misunderstanding what i'm saying. there is a big difference (to me, at least) between asking ""where does this bus go?"", which is very frustrating, and asking ""does this bus go to [some specific place]?"", which is fine."
3787	39097	8521	bp9xm7	enqsoc2	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	as a bus rider, people need to stop playing their music
3788	39097	178	bp9xm7	enqzxyq	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i drove for my college's transportation system, so there were no fares to ride. one thing that's a given on most public transportation systems is the courtesy of letting the people currently on the bus get off before you try to get on; this was very difficult for college kids for some reason, and it was compounded by the fact that you can board through both the front and the back door, so we'd have people trying to squeeze their way on (at both doors) while there were still people getting off. it's a pipe dream, but that problem would go away completely if everyone would just board in the front and exit in the back. such a simple solution that sadly will never, ever happen because people are too {insert adjective}. also, when you get on the bus (or are already on it), and the bus is getting full so you're standing, and there are more people coming on, **move toward the back**. i had to sit there and talk to these people (of all ages) like children, ""please move back and make room,"" because they simply were unaware that they were standing directly in the way of like 20 people trying to board when there's still plenty of room on the bus. i guess, if i can sum it all up, just pay attention, and realize that you're not the only person on the bus."
3789	39097	2160	bp9xm7	enqv952	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	**clean up after yourselves** my dad services buses for the cta here in chicago and the amount ot nasty things he's had to clean up for people is insane. things like condoms, rotten food, he's even found used needles once. please remember that the bus is not your personal trashcan, someone has to clean that mess up. aside from that he loves his job though and even got to do the holiday bus one year. [here he is dressed up as an elf for it.](https://youtu.be/fmpmmsku76w?t=36s)
3790	39097	346	bp9xm7	enr08ra	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i wonder if it's a british thing. but whenever get the bus, we don't stand in line or form an orderly queue, rather just mill around or stand wherever. however while doing that we will have taken note of exactly who was there before we were. so when the bus arrives a queue will spontaneously form with everyone in the exact order of arrival.
3791	39097	1187	bp9xm7	enqvgg6	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	not a driver, but a regular bus-user who would like to post something on behalf of the drivers. if the bus is late due to traffic, this is not the driver's fault!!! so many people get on my bus and give the driver an earful when the bus is late. do you really think that driver has control over the traffic buildup in the two cities that the bus travels between? do you think that the driver has the ability to magically fly over the cars in order to get to your bus stop in time? the driver is enjoying this traffic even less than you are. they have no control over it. give him/her a break. at least you have the option to get off and walk.
3792	39097	1111	bp9xm7	enqu6ki	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	one thing i would of liked people to know when i was driving was that once the doors are closed and were pulling away, its too dangerous to re-open the doors and let you on. were not being dicks by driving off. too many accidents happen when people ignore this and its the driver that gets the blame.
3793	39097	494	bp9xm7	enqvtj4	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	what i've learnt in this thread is that there is no ideal world for bus drivers and passengers to co-exist.
3794	39097	61	bp9xm7	enr1upe	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i'm on a bus as i type this, i want to know why some people choose to stand (particularly at the front, near the driver) when there are plenty of seats available?
3795	39097	3957	bp9xm7	enqr8a1	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	not a bus driver - but customers should always have the payment method ready before boarding.
3796	39097	110	bp9xm7	enqxraq	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	we are not a tourist information hub.
3797	39097	56	bp9xm7	enr6fce	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i used to be a bus driver and now work in management for a public transit agency. i always feel the worst for drivers when they get chewed out for things they cannot control, like running late. there are times where theres a big event in town and traffic is at a complete standstill and people get mad at the driver because the bus is late. like, what.? also, most bus drivers are some of the nicest, hardest working people ive ever met. its not easy to drive a bus and have the safety of so many people in your hands (not just on the bus, but anyone around the bus). give them the benefit of the doubt as much as possible. also, public transit is extremely underfunded. buses are built to last 12 years but many (pretty much all) agencies have to run buses much longer because of lack of funding. this means buses break down more and end up costing more in the long run due to maintenance. i just had a call the other day where someone complained the bus they rode on was old and dirty and just trash. that bus is almost 20 years old; we dont choose to keep it around because we want to, but because we have to. so many people in the community really rely on public transit but there are political groups actively trying to reduce funding to make public transit worse. i feel bad for the people who really need it. public transit constantly gets requests for more service, or to expand it to areas where it isnt, but they cant because theres not enough funding. theres plenty of money in the economy, but politicians prioritize other things. please speak up to your representatives to provide more funding for public transit. ppublix transit is full of hard working people trying to do the right thing to improve lives in the community and provide opportunity.
3798	39097	209	bp9xm7	enqxpaq	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	not a driver but as the parent of a wild child apparently like every bus drivers worst fear is running over a child they can't see. let your driver breathe. hold your kids hand when the bus approaches.
3799	39097	1820	bp9xm7	enqhxpf	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	seems they are all working, here, have an upvote so the thread might arrive in trending.
3800	39097	84	bp9xm7	enraupf	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	if it's a bus stop with multiple routes, please wave me off if you dont want to get on my bus. pulling to the curb and then reentering traffic is time consuming and dangerous. please don't stand at the edge of the curb for the bus. most large buses have their wheels behind the first 3-4 feet if the bus body. to get completely out of traffic and enter the stop i must often swing the bus nose over the curb. you can be bonked by the mirror or hit by the bus bumper. please get out of the way. we cannot pick you up if you aren't at the stop. seriously, we can be reprimanded or fired for such action, don't get mad.
3801	39097	45	bp9xm7	enrc6it	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"my bf is a busdriver, i asked him to answer this. his answer (translated to english ofc): i wish customers know i'm not google maps. people literally get mad at me for not knowing obscure street a in faraway village y. i just drive past through there, i don't live there :') in the same spirit: i also don't know where all my collegues are at any time, so no, i don't know when bus x, y, z is coming, or why they're late. neither do i know at what time bus 43 is supposed to depart at obscure-middle-of-nowhere busstop. we (as in, society) have booklets and infosigns and the internet for that to look it up. because seriously, busdrivers aren't gonna memorise all thousands of busstops and accompanying arrival and departure times, only for them to change every year again. (note from me: people sometimes seriously get aggressive if a driver can't answer such a question!) also, even if the ""do not talk with driver"" sign is on, we still appreciate it when you shout a ""thank you!"" or a ""have a nice day"" to us. we're people too you know :) tl;dr: busdrivers aren't computers, look your own shit up."
3802	39097	521	bp9xm7	enqz7ow	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	my girlfriend and i are both drivers in the uk. we've thought of a few: if there's perspex between you and the driver, speak up. it's much louder in the cab than you think. when you put your card on the machine to scan, please leave it alone. do not move it around, side to side, swipe it, or remove it from the machine after 0.2 seconds. please stop using buses to break big notes. change is valuable to us. using 20 to pay 2.30 makes us hate you, especially when we see piles of coins in your wallet. following on from that, small change like 1p, and 2p isn't change. it's worthless and heavy. stop thinking you're doing us a favour by dumping your shit coins on us. ring the damn bell. the number of times someone's just come and stood behind me without saying a word and expected me to see them and stop is ridiculous. we're concentrating on the road, not the saloon, graham. buses can't fly. we're late because of traffic and because of idiots doing all of the above.
3803	39097	90	bp9xm7	enr2s35	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	does school bus count? do not pass my red lights. not only is it a ticket, but half the time i'm outside the bus crossing kids, all under ten years old. i've almost been hit by cars. i have people try to pass after i put my handheld sign down. apparently the red lights that mean stop arent enough, and the sign on the side that swings out isnt enough, but the plastic one i'm holding will finally do the trick. why do my freaking elementary schoolers have to be smarter and more mature than you sick fucks driving the two ton death machines? if you try to creep by while i'm getting back in the bus, i will stop you, and it will take way longer. 30 extra freaking seconds on the brake while i make sure no kids are nearby is all i ask.
3804	39097	1020	bp9xm7	enqpfzx	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	before leaving the bus, please thank the bus drivers !
3805	39097	235	bp9xm7	enqya7y	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i'm from finland and i didnt know people acted this bad on buses in the us. here usually nobody says a word and everyone is quiet on the bus, people don't block old people with bags, there is no screaming kids. we have really good transportation systems i guess. if you want the bus to stop at the next stop you press a ""stop"" button located next to every seat to alert the driver. everyone knows if you have change not a pass to go in last."
3806	39097	20	bp9xm7	enr7ylc	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i don't know why the number 89 is late. i'm driving this bus and i'm not on the same roads as that service. stop huffing! stop looking at your phone when your bus is due, it's not going to stop the bus for you. and buses travel on one side of the road, stop looking the opposite way. if there's more than one service for your bus stop, make sure you flag your bus down. we won't automatically stop just because you're stood there. especially if we're late. passes and fares at the ready! and if it's before 0930 (uk), you can't use your oap pass yet. stop making us late so you can go to town for a natter with betty and george. don't barge on once the doors open. prams and wheelchair users might be wanting to get off, nevermind other passengers. and when the driver says ""no more"", it's meant. the bus is at capacity and becomes dangerous to drive if over laden. ""why are you late?!"" because traffic is bad. ""what traffic?!"" the traffic that isn't around here so you won't bloody see it will you!? get on and sit down already!"

"as a bus rider, i wish people respected the implicit ""line"" when waiting for the bus. i'm always one to let the elderly,handicapped, or overencumbered board first, but i always get a little annoyed when i'm standing here waiting for 15 minutes and johnny nofucks over here runs up as the bus is arriving and takes the last available seat"

"im not a buss driver, but a high school student and i use bus to get to school. i hate those elder ladies who sit and laugh loudly in the bus till on their stop the buss already closes the door, and then they get up and shout ""wait, wait! dont be in such a hurry"""
3811	39097	19	bp9xm7	enr1ob8	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	bus driver here. first of all, i agree with the other driver in this thread that mentioned he was mostly annoyed by other bus drivers. me too. bunch of complainers.also more annoyed by the other drivers on the road. as for passengers, as simple please as this is, please leave with your trash. bending down in between seats to pick it up is always the last thing i want to do at the end of my shift.
3812	39097	105	bp9xm7	enqwhlq	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	no bathroom breaks. once i had the rhino virus and had to wear adult diapers.
3813	39097	13	bp9xm7	enr1zik	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	we're not all miserable bastards. some of us like a chat and a smile. and i'll even change a 20 when i can. and we don't always wait for you to sit down because you look able bodied, take it as a compliment.
3814	39097	14	bp9xm7	enrhss1	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	1. i am not fucking google maps. 2. have your pass or ticket or fare ready. 3. if it says exact fare only then i do not give change. 4. no you can't ask everyone on the bus if they have change. 5. don't fucking litter. 6. don't eat food that leaves a lingering smell. 7. at the bus stop let the driver know you want their bus to stop by giving some sort of signal (ie hand out) 8. don't walk into the road to get us to stop. 9. keep control of your kids, if i need to emergency stop it's not my fault your kid was climbing on the seat. 10. wash please wash this includes clothes. i'll add more as i think of them
3815	39097	178	bp9xm7	enqtdw4	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i wish people would give the bus driver $100 as a tip for no reason more often

3817	39097	16	bp9xm7	enrbhpg	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"other drivers are typically more annoying for me, the customers i deal with are relatively fine for the most part (they are mostly college kids just going to class). what they can do is this: -if i'm making an announcement on the pa, it might be extremely important: these kiddos hop on the bus with their earbuds in or they're staring at their phone not paying attention. transfers are missed because they simply don't hear me announce a transfer point. i've had times where i've had to announce detours and i get complaints that they weren't informed. when i'm running extras and i go out of service at a certain spot, not only do i have to deal with trying to get people to read my huge ""not in service"" sign on the outside, i have to try and get the people off of my bus so i can go to my next extra. the stragglers didn't hear my announcement that i was not going beyond a certain point. listen to your bus driver when they're talking, kids!"

3821	39097	32	bp9xm7	enqzijl	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	obligatory not a bus driver, but my older brother was. here in the uk you are eligible for a free bus pass after a certain age - its mostly to help old people get about when they are no longer fit to drive. but these people have nothing better to do in their old age and have the gall to complain when a bus is 1 minute late when theyre not even paying for the travel! it was 1 minute! another classic my brother used to encounter an awful lot is when people get on with not enough money to purchase a ticket and will try and haggle with the driver. thatll be 4 ive only got 3.50 the price is 4 well i only have 3.50 and i really need to get to x location well you best start walking then if you *really* need to get somewhere you should have enough money to pay for a ticket - you wouldnt get to the checkout in a supermarket and say the same, the price is the price! so if people did less of those things it would be an improvement
3822	39097	12	bp9xm7	enr0zse	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	stand behind that damn yellow line!
3823	39097	11	bp9xm7	enr1pfm	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	if the bus is late it's probably not the drivers fault. whether it's roadworks, football traffic or like last week for me, a drunk collapsed on my bus and needed an ambulance. when there's a queue of 20 people getting on asking why the bus is late and expecting us to explain that to every single one of them, its going to make us even later than we already were. edit: also worth noting at least where i work. the timetable we follow is treated as a guideline not a set of rules. because it's literally impossible to be 100% on time all the time.

3831	39097	9	bp9xm7	enr7jgg	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	blah blah. not a bus driver: in australia, if the indicator blinks for 4 times, the bus has right of way, you arrogant ignorant assholes. let them in.
3832	39097	9	bp9xm7	enr953e	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"""stop 'accidentally' bumping the emergency window release button"", according to my high school bus driver."
3833	39097	9	bp9xm7	ens80pu	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	turn off bluetooth speakers. don't shit on the bus. don't have sex on the bus. leave other riders alone. let elderly or disabled have your seat when the bus is full.
3834	39097	16	bp9xm7	enra3fj	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	my dads been a bus driver for 33 years now. he started at 21, and hes turning 55 in a month. i asked him and he said passengers should have their bloody tickets & cash ready before they get on, because its annoying when they have to search through their bag all the time. and im not a bus driver nor do i take buses often, but please be respectful of the drivers at least. i remember one year my dad was given a bunch of christmas cards by primary school students he drove to school. he didnt show much of a reaction when telling us but it just made me so happy that people appreciate what he does. my dad doesnt have to clean the buses he drives, but i highly doubt itd be nice to smell trash while driving so please clean up after yourself. plus its just gross to litter.
3835	39097	74	bp9xm7	enqs8h8	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	sounds weird but i spent most my life scared of bus drivers because whenever i got on the bus, the driver seemed in a bad mood and was mean towards me. i know not all bus drivers are like that. but it made me stop taking the bus and using lyft instead.
3836	39097	8	bp9xm7	enr9fm0	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	not a bus driver anymore. the driver is a human, treat them as such, rather than something you need to scrape off your shoe.
3837	39097	8	bp9xm7	enrcdg0	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	im a bus driver from a city of ~90k. for the most part, people say hello, goodbye, and thank you, and as a driver it is appreciated. one thing i wish customers knew is that sometimes youll see a bus driver stop at a coffee shop and come out with a coffee. 99% of the time, the stop wasnt to get a coffee. during my shift, (540a-240p) i get off my bus for one 35-40 minute break. if i have to use a restroom outside of that break, i may have to use a coffee shop for that purpose. these coffee shops usually know whats up, and drivers tend to know the ones that have good, clean washrooms. they dont get paid by my employer for allowing us to use their facilities, and to keep them clean, so we feel kinda of obligated to purchase something when we use their establishment. even in a city of my size, we still get people taking photos of our drivers walking to or from a shop with a coffee or something. it sucks to get hammered in the press because you had to take a leak and couldnt hold it.
3838	39097	8	bp9xm7	enrcye8	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	finally a thread i have an answer for. i drive a school bus for an afterschool program. my biggest problem is with other drivers on the road. it's like no one understands how to drive around bigger vehicles. like i need people to understand that i may be slower on the road, but i'm also slower to break than you as well. and not all drivers of big vehicles are innocent. a lot of them don't know how to properly drive them either.
3839	39097	9	bp9xm7	enrv8he	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	the rules on the bus don't exist because i'm an assshole. they exist for my safety and your safety. i'm a bus driver, not a babysitter. if i'm focusing my attention on you breaking the rules, then i'm not focusing on the road. and i want to keep my job so when people break the rules i have to do something. my bus has 8 cameras with full audio and they investigate every complaint. all it takes is one call in saying someone was breaking the rules in that bus driver did nothing. so next time you're eating on the bus, or have your music up too loud, or talking on your cell phone, swearing, know that i'm not calling you out to be a jerk. i just want to keep my job and be safe.
3840	39097	9	bp9xm7	ensaflr	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i've been working on public transit for about six years now. i operated streetcars that functioned like buses (a stop at every block, but they don't stop unless there's demand for it), buses, and light rail trains now. operators can be kind of petty because we work a somewhat thankless job. 1) if you want terrible service, be sure to remind the operator that he's late. i've gotten stuck in traffic, or stuck behind another train that broke down, or any number of things that i couldn't do a damn thing about. once i'm on the move again, there's always at least one person who looks at me sternly and taps their watch. i get it, i'm late. the little trip computer has been showing negative numbers for the last fifteen minutes; it's hard to miss. by doing this, i specifically remember you. if there's a point in the future where i'm on time and you're not, i won't wait for you now because you annoyed the hell out of me. 2) if you want great service, bring food. sealed food is the best. a bottle of soda where the seal hasn't been popped, an unopened bag of chips or whatnot can help a lot. i'll not even joking when i said i had a regular that brought me a big cookie once, and two weeks later i didn't see him at his usual station. i did, however, see him running up from about a block away. since he was actually running and had brought me good food, we all waited for him even though it made me a little late. i made up the time quickly enough though. 3) stop requests are important. if you're on a route that has stops in every block, we're not stopping at each one every time. pull the cord, push the button, even saying ""next stop, please!"" is enough communication. standing behind me is not. do you want a better view of where you're going because you're lost? do you want the next stop? or what about the stop after that? if you stand there silently, i know nothing. 4) hearing music on the bus and train sucks because 99% of time it's not music you like. shut that shit off, an don't you dare get upset when the operator or another passenger asks you to be a decent human being and turn it off. 5) the trains i run now have very limited rearward visibility from the cab. a lot of stuff happens behind me that i miss. if you see someone unload bodily fluids onto the train, let the operator know. i wouldn't want to ride a train with vomit all over the floor, and i don't expect you all to either. 6) holding the door for your buddy who is late or was hanging out on the wrong side of the platform is a dick move and i don't know if any train operator who doesn't wish misfortune upon those who do it. i personally try to limit the amount of misfortune i wish upon these people to ""i hope a bird shits on your head"" but man, if you do this at the wrong time, you could probably bottle my rage and sell it as a renewable energy source."
