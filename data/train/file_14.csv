"the 18 yo me abandoned my abusive, narcissistic family with a single packed bag and $500 to my name. she made some good choices, some dumb choices. she showed up to her college classes everyday. she found a job working graveyard at a gas station just after 9/11 when racism was rampant and socially acceptable. she got hit by a van and that complicated showing up to work and when finances slipped, she was homeless for a time. but she still found a way to survive and keep going to school and hold down a job. because somewhere in her heart she knew that whatever situations she would get herself in as a newly minted adult would never be worse than the situation she had left behind. i'm 35 now and still dealing with depression on again and off again after plenty of therapy. self care takes so much of my energy. a few years ago i worked with a woman who was 84. she was an artist hired to do a project and had basically lived a life of great success (name withheld) and could take projects on selectively. we were talking about politics and then our lives. she too had up and left at a very young age to make a better life for herself. she told me to remember that 18 year old young woman in my darkest moments. to hold onto her and never lose her because she has enough courage in her heart to get me through anything. ""don't forget her,"" she said. ""you must never forget that part of you that is willing to fight for a better life."" i will never forget this woman or her advice."

(our class got the pictures to go with this story, they're online somewhere i'm sure but i do not recommend) he survived and a year later, more desperate to die than ever, attempted to od on pain pills he had been hoarding, but survived again.
