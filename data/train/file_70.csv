3521	39824	19341	blf1l9	emo4jyv	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	maya beach. it was in that 2000 leo dicaprio movie where it was depicted as a 'paradise'. &#x200b; now way too many tourists visit there, beyond the beach's capacity, and it's destroyed almost all of the coral reef and marine life. the government of thailand had to close the beach down indefinitely last year to let the ecosystem recover.
3522	39824	9993	blf1l9	emow40y	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	airbnb is ruining hawaii. the wealthy (who are often non-residents) are buying up all the 'affordable' housing, so residents are being forced to move to the mainland.
3523	39824	9087	blf1l9	emnz4zg	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"tourism to ultra popular places, especially smaller cities. dubrovnik immediately comes to mind. the first time i went was pre-game of thrones and i thought it was pretty touristy, but sort of in a ""typical"" popular european destination way. i went again a few years later (after got became really popular) with my then-boyfriend because we were in the area and he hadn't been.and holy shit. it is the only place i've ever thought was absolutely ruined by the huge amount of tourists. and that was in autumn! i'd hate to see what it's like in the summer."
3524	39824	19911	blf1l9	emohj9n	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"back when etsy was in its heyday it was really awesome finding unique artists doing unique things all over the world. i loved that i could find things for any niche interest i could dream of, would eat up their featured artist videos for inspiration, and felt like i had a real chance at selling the crafts i've loved making for years. nowadays a lot of it is chinese resellers and people selling things they ""made"" that you can tell were just like 2 things they bought and glued together. it was kind of fun at first back when regretsy was a thing (fjls unite!) but now i feel like i have to be super meticulous when i'm shopping on there to make sure what i'm looking at is indeed either a vintage or handmade item and that it's not something from alibaba or wish with a 500% markup. not to mention trying to stand out among all that crap if you're trying to sell things."

3528	39824	6137	blf1l9	emp365i	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	flipping houses. ive never been interested in doing it myself, but when just a few people who actually knew how to improve a fixer-upper and resell it after increasing its value were doing it, it was a legitimate service. now its just artificially inflating housing prices when investors buy up every open property in an area, put in trendy, garbage fixtures and cheap paint, and expect unreasonable prices so normal people cant afford homes. its ruining the housing market in a lot of places.

3531	39824	8465	blf1l9	emo3ssx	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"instagram (specific types of accounts). as much as i love using it for friends, everything is so overdone to the extreme. photographers edit their photos to basically look like a place that doesn't actually exist but are dishonest about it. ""models"" all have the same poses, locations, aesthetic themes. all those people that post as a ""lifestyle blog"" but it's just a bunch of pictures of them on vacation or advertising some sketchy looking online shop. people that have thousands of followers and every single one of their posts is a selfie. sorry if any of these things intrigue you, in my opinion i just feel like they're so overdone and hard to avoid."

3545	39824	9326	blf1l9	emnxtn0	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"there was a beautiful pristine waterfall near where i used to camp during the summer. we could go and enjoy hours playing in it in absolute isolation, and we knew enough to be careful not to stress the landscape too much. now, you can't go there without the hoards of ugly people with their screaming children and barking dogs that monopolize the water, eroding the banks and destroying the surrounding flora. they leave behind their dog shit and litter, including baby diapers and beer cans that are often seen bobbing around in what was once a crystal clear pool. i hate those people. edit: just to clarify, my description of these people as ""ugly"" is a reference more to their behaviour and attitude than their external looks. second edit: in response to all the people who asked me why i thought this beautiful spot only belonged to me: i didn't. in fact, i knew that other people were enjoying the falls but they did it with more respect and there were fewer of them. the question was ""what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?"" - i answered that question with an anecdote from my own experience."
3546	39824	96	blf1l9	emoqs70	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"website development. first off you have those builders like wix that cost a lot of money to the consumer. then you have these people that took one wordpress class and claim to be a developer. for some reason i can't find any clients, although i'm not trying to hard because i have a full time job. seems like its saturated. i am the person who has to fix the server that was hacked or is running too many processes because of ""developers""."
3547	39824	4097	blf1l9	emoasf7	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	taking pictures or recording a concert. last weekend was my first ever concert and i was amazed at how many people decided to record the whole concert and watch it through their phones screens. i was there hoping people put down their phones and let me watch the artist, but instead i needed to move my head avoiding all those phones. and i'm sure they'll not watch those recordings.

3549	39824	3698	blf1l9	emnyyb7	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	historical sites: several places like venice, colosseum, santorini, pyramids of giza. in addition to natural things like coral reefs at raja ampat or even just the waters around antarctica all being overrun, overpopulated and polluted by the increasing number of people wanting to see the world and nail the perfect insta posts.
3550	39824	3596	blf1l9	emo3qsg	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"shopping at thrift stores. i grew up poor so pretty much all of my clothes came from the thrift store. i still liked shopping there when i was in high school we were a bit better off. there was one on the walk from the train to my house that i went to pretty much every other day after school. the prices never changed much and i got some of my favorite sweaters from there like [this one that i call french man](https://i.imgur.com/z4d5d7y.jpg) and this [awesome halloween sweater.](https://i.imgur.com/vjeypww.jpg) around my senior of high school i started noticing people coming in with lists of things to buy. these guys would come to thrift stores to buy items they wanted for their boutique shops where they would sell them as ""vintage"" for a huge markup. after that started becoming huge, along with the macklemore song, the prices started getting higher and higher. these people ruined thrift stores by making them start jacking up their prices and i hate that it happened because i loved shopping there."
3551	39824	1242	blf1l9	emow27w	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	social media in general. i just straight deleted everything besides reddit a few years ago and the way this place is trending.

3555	39824	605	blf1l9	emp3kv5	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"music festivals. the age of social media means that a tonne of people go not because they care about the live acts, but just to be seen in the right places so they can post their photos to instagram and everybody knows they're ""cool"". which leads to organisers having justification to jack up ticket prices, and genuine music fans having to pay through the eyeballs or miss out for vapid hipsters and wannabe insta-models."

3558	39824	386	blf1l9	emoyng1	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	my town. i've lived here for a few decades, and we used to be a relatively small area. we were the shopping center for the area (mall and a few department stores), so we were a little busy, but nothing too bad. really, it was nice being close to shit that we needed, but far enough away that everything was quiet. then, developers started cramming subdivisions into every open area they could. it's especially bad for me, because most of them are being added onto the two lane road that i leave my neighborhood on. when i was in elementary school, there was almost no traffic leaving my neighborhood in the morning. by the time i could drive, i had to find another route to go, because the exit to my neighborhood was backed up 1/4 mile every morning when i left. plus, my neighborhood was surrounded by woods, and now it's ugly as shit because they're just clearing it all for more houses. then, industry started moving in. amazon came in and bought up a bunch of warehouses. then, they started building more. it takes me forever to get to work in the winter, because they have to have cops manually do the traffic lights so amazon employees don't grind it to a halt. they also just cleared a shit ton of forest area to build a few more amazon warehouses, right next to where they cleared even more for more factories/warehouses. the traffic here is so fucking bad. i used to never really plan on hitting any, but now it's just a constant standstill everywhere. i have to tack on an extra 5-10 minutes to get to work. an extra 5-10 minutes to go to the store. coming back from class, an extra 15 minutes if i leave too late. plus, they're expanding some roads that will realistically only make things worse, so my whole area looks completely naked, because you can see stuff over a mile away now. i'm leaving the area as soon as i can. this place is just too ugly and congested.
3559	39824	1136	blf1l9	emp8dul	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	influencers - dear god, make them stop. theyre getting desperate now, its really pathetic. everyone wants to be internet famous - instantly. zero work ethic.

3562	39824	278	blf1l9	emp3ezu	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	"total change of pace here: raves. back in the 80s and 90s when mdma was pure and raves had a true underground feel to them. having to call a number the night of the event and it being hosted in an abandoned warehouse, running the risk of getting caught was part of the point. people who were there for the love of the music or the community of being part of a group and feeling like you belonged there. now ""edm parties"" are commercialized, overwrought with people acting like jackasses, drunken idiots, professional hoopers that do it for fashion, and wannabe social media influencers. the feeling of acceptance and unity is gone, and plur is met with confusion instead of a smile."
3563	39824	1645	blf1l9	emohftg	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	going to college. i'm not calling for a restriction of higher education, but we need to shotgun blast into oblivion this idea that every fucking teenager needs to have college as their next step. the value of a bachelor's has plummeted and competition in the job market is getting worse because nowhere near enough jobs exist for the number of people coming out of college every year.

3570	39824	209	blf1l9	emp7vib	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	social media. i remember when social media was like this fun way to kind of interact with your friends or look at funny videos, but now its so political and everyone is on thin ice trying to not offend everyone its the worst. i cant even remember the last time someone mentioned the app ifunny. instagram is nothing but terrible washed up vine comedians and ads for fake airpods. twitter is nothing but recycled memes and political issues. facebook is like the internet explorer of all the social media platforms. and i dont even have friends that is life outside of snapchat or ig stories. its sad. :(
3571	39824	332	blf1l9	empeyju	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	body positivity. that sounds bad but hear me out. im all for being positive about your body and your differences and everyone deserves the opportunity to be showcased and (more importantly) employed. but i feel like companies have all jumped on the bandwagon and are all bleating look how awesome we are for having a fat/thin/down syndrome/albino/little person/etc in our ad! like to the point that i feel like they dont actually give a fuck about the person theyre photographing, they just care about how others will perceive them. its all just a show to gain a profit, they dont *actually* care about those people.

3579	39824	417	blf1l9	emo5o25	what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	mt. everest. apparently the mountain is covered with trash and dead bodies to the point nepal closed it down so they can try to clean it up. a lot of very popular snorkeling spots, particularly in places like hi the ecosystem is very fragile and too many people are complete dumbasses and/assholes. they stand on the coral reefs or even purposefully break off pieces to take home as souvenirs. most sunscreens also contain chemicals that are harmful to the fish and reefs and because so many people go to certain spots to much of those chemicals get into the after and start bleaching the reefs. thats why hi has banned the sale of most sunscreens in their state.
