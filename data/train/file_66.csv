5178	32855	6732	btexev	eoyfn4k	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we didn't give ourselves participation trophies.
5179	32855	1132	btexev	eoy6zuf	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	most things millennials gripe about arent just whiny child bs, theyre legitimate issues. unaffordable housing lower wages employers requiring more experience for entry level positions unreal student loan debt these are real issues. since the average retirement age keeps increasing, these issues will only get worse.
5180	32855	4937	btexev	eoy6nr3	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we got some really shitty advice, did everything we were asked to do, and when it didn't work we got bitched at for not doing it hard enough.
5181	32855	1572	btexev	eoy66tm	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i think we are the only gen to have grown up in both the pre-internet and internet era. i remember growing up with vcrs and walkman's. i remember dial-up internet when the internet was still a gimmick and not all that interesting. i remember growing up in a state of constant change. both socially, politically and technologically. i think this state of constant change and constant adaptation is why we do so well with technology, when our parents, just one gen earlier, grew up with a mostly analogue world, and that's why it's so hard for them to change with the world. for better or worse, we have been given a unique way of growing up, and we are the only generation to have grown up in both 'eras' of history.
5182	32855	10425	btexev	eoxexi4	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	labor jobs are not shameful and you can actually earn good money doing it. trades are dying because we were told to go to college and then get a desk job because it's better than what mom or dad does now.
5183	32855	2727	btexev	eoy2acz	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"the reason older people can get away with ""not being a computer/ technology person"" is not because they are unnecessary. it's because you have your kids and grandkids to do that shit for you. stop shitting on technology and maybe just say thank you to them."
5184	32855	20066	btexev	eoxrgm8	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	everytime you bash millenials for taking participation ribbons remember who came up with that stupid fucking idea. here is a clue: it wasn't us.
5185	32855	22549	btexev	eowyrqg	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	how to rotate a goddamn pdf
5186	32855	2626	btexev	eoy8fd0	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	millennials are not one homogenous group. some are successful, some are struggling. some are urban, some are rural. some have college education, some do not. some live with their parents, some live alone. some have marriage and kids, some are single. generalizing an entire generation makes it an us vs them argument, that you assume everyone is on one side or the other. dont fall for this bullshit. if someone is an entitled little shit, its not because theyre a millennial, its because theyre an entitled little shit. ive met 20 year olds that are elses, and ive met 60 year olds that are elses. its not a generational thing. stop projecting societal frustrations on people who happened to be born in a different year than you, and realize that if you accept and address the real issues of societal change, were all better off.
5187	32855	1739	btexev	eoy72w5	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	every time i read a thread about being a millennial, it just ends in depression. thats the legacy our parents generations have left us  depression and anxiety.
5188	32855	8499	btexev	eox5h8t	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	the economy is growing but our paychecks are **not.** economists will tell you that wages generally increase with productivity  that youre paid in line with the value of what you do.
5189	32855	31285	btexev	eox6ct5	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	ms word is not a fucking design program and shouldnt be used as one.
5190	32855	35503	btexev	eoxvr3i	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	most people don't know the age of millennials. to them, a millennial is someone that they hate and happens to be younger than them.
5191	32855	14068	btexev	eoy0og1	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	when we don't really sell ourselves on microsoft programs in job interviews, it's because that's like asking if we know how to write. we grew up with the shit. it's not hard. edit: just to address the most common response, i understand that excel is way more than adding functions and has amazing capabilities beyond my comprehension. my comment was more of an attack on jobs that put so much emphasis on microsoft office programs, and yet they only require basic functionality.
5192	32855	7603	btexev	eoy9j6d	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that nearly every place you apply wants you to do it online. no, going in will not help you get your foot in the door. more often than not it's just going to annoy them. also - super annoying when people don't believe you about this so they go in and ask for an application and are told to apply online. like.i legit could have told you this would happen. i was at target, working behind the counter at the customer service desk, saw a guy walk in and insist on applying in person. they found him a physical application and once he left they threw it in the trash. that was one of the managers who did that by the way. update : for clarification he walked in, asked for a physical copy, said he couldnt put in online because he didnt have a computer, the network for the store was down - he was friendly, shook hands, and had decent qualifications. they didnt care. no, i dont find it shocking that you, your son/daughter, or your family pet got a job walking in some place. not everyones experience is the same. every time ive followed up on an application, went in person, or tried to see a manager i get told to leave and that they will contact me when ready. at two places, they even put me on hold for half an hour before hanging up when i tried to follow up on an application. call backs were rejected. every job ive gotten involved either a phone interview followed by a start day, an online interview followed by a start day, or getting called to meet hr. target was just the most overt example, but nowhere ive worked has ever accepted walk-ins, taken physical anything, or let people talk to the manager about employment. for reference, ive worked big-box-store jobs, factory work, and non-chain stores. your experience may differ, but you are the exception, not the rule. even my local generic corner store and a new-age accessories shop want online apps, and my neighborhood family-owned pizza place has a detailed website.
5193	32855	45544	btexev	eox05iy	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that the average millennial is 30 years old, not a teenybopper or college kid.
5194	32855	12853	btexev	eox92yp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"the whole ""i had my house paid by the time i was 25"" from old people. houses cost a whole lot less then, barbara."
5195	32855	7265	btexev	eowse1r	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	you cant pause a raid in warcraft okay. you just. cannot.
5196	32855	18741	btexev	eoxchfw	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	im the oldest millennial. i have worked ridiculously hard, with no end in sight, to make the same money my dad, with no degree or specialized training, made and makes to this day.
5197	32855	641	btexev	eoy5yh6	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"that you can take on over 100k in debt (because your parents' income decided you got basically nothing for student expense assistance, even though there's no guarantee your parents will pay for anything), and go on to get a phd. and still only make national median income. yep, doctor median, that's surely what i signed up for. (drowning in debt, pls send halp.) whoever the old fucks are who decided to get rich off of the education of future generations can burn in hell for eternity. edit: there's another comment here that conveyed what i was trying to say far more eloquently. we did everything we were asked to do, and when our lives didn't magically work out it's still our fault for not doing ""it"" hard enough or well enough. we weren't the ones who fucked the housing market, made billions off of students, inflated the acceptable interest rates on all forms of debt, or outsourced many of our profitable industries to other continents. i'm not saying we wouldn't have done some of that if we didn't have the chance, but i'm sticking it to the previous generations for thinking they were perfect when they actually fucked up a lot of things."
5198	32855	6489	btexev	eox4tit	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that if i fail to get a job from multiple different places it doesnt mean im not trying it means the place that i tried are just picky with who they hire.
5199	32855	10180	btexev	eoxf7z8	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"the whole ""just go get a better job/put out for a promotion"" line of thought. a lot of the time we just cant do that, and one particularly annoying part of it is because you're still sitting at the top. in my profession there is very little to no upward movement, the median age for a full time teacher where i've worked is in the late 50's-early 60's. nothing against them, as sometimes they can have brilliant ideas/techniques. but it's frustrating to look at the job ladder and see no-one going up because people wont/can't get off, and you can't get on. edit: wow, never thought my most rated post would be voicing my vague frustrations to the aether. not sure if to thank you guys. just to clarify, i know that this is a symptom of the greater failings of how things are run. it wasn't meant to be an ageist dig in particular, just my frustrated observations on my current situation. i'm actually moving out of my country in a few months for a job with a ""typical"" amount of hours. while here i have to compete with the casual market and those f****** relief apps. for those who don't know: when a relief position appears, the school uses the app to send a message to everyone on their lists and it's practically a race to accept it. have to spend all morning watching my phone like a hawk for even the chance at one of those positions. it doesn't help that if i don't get enough work in the next few years then i just drop off the government's books and have to re-get my qualifications. partially the reason for such high teacher turnover/losses in graduates."
5200	32855	13876	btexev	eox0h8n	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that its hard, even in my early thirties with a good full time job, to afford rent and food and everything else. i wish i had been born in a time where working a job like i have now would pay for a three bedroom house and two cars. no, im not lazy. i just dont think i should have to work two full time jobs just to survive.
5201	32855	8079	btexev	eox2ny1	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"we may very well be the first ""over-educated"" generation in the history of this country. most of us have college degrees, and very sizable portion of us have graduate degrees too. we have these because we basically have to in order to even have the chance of making enough money for a comfortable life as adults. we are a little pissed off because we all grew up being told that if you do ok in highschool and go to college, you'll be able to get a job that'll pay you well-enough to live the life you want to live. then, we did those things and when we got to the other end of it, it was all basically jerked away."
5202	32855	19458	btexev	eoxa0sn	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	when people who grew into adulthood in the 2000s and 2010s ignore your economic/career advice, it's not becuase we're snotty or ungrateful or don't value your opinion. it's because the economy is so different that advice which may have been good in the 50s-80s is not likely to still be good.
5203	32855	20115	btexev	eox9t4i	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	why it is that most of the older generation (& some millennials) can have something called a cellphone in their pocket & decide to never take a minute to fact check something that sounds suspicious.
5204	32855	7083	btexev	eox0wpl	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	almost every advantage prior generations had has been stripped away. affordable college, wages that allow you to pay rent and buy food. other things like retirement security - nope 401ks with fees that chew up your savings or bubbles that wipe it out. unemployment protections have even become unreliable if you get laid off. and forget going to the dentist regularly hahaha good luck maintaining health insurance. work hard for less and be called a whiner for pointing it out.
5205	32855	10386	btexev	eoyailk	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that most of us have actually done customer service jobs our whole life.and when people talk about how millennials and the younger generations are all about instant gratification. each and every one of us has vivid memories of old fucking dirt bags throwing goddamn tantrums because they didn't get their way right that very moment. old people have absolutely no patience for anything. younger people typically have more manners. edit: holy shit, it seems i hit a nerve. i'm a low level shit posting troll and i don't know how to deal with this positive attention. thank you for gold and silver. and yes yes. i get the fact that not all boomers are like this. and not all millennials are nice well mannered saints. the only thing a millennial might find more annoying than a boomer is another millennial since self hatred is kind of our jam. but it's the media that presents one side on a more favorable light verses the other, so let us younger schmucks have our opportunity to vent.
5206	32855	203	btexev	eoybwyj	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i have a house now that cost 120+thousand dollars more than it was when you raised me. and its smaller than the house we grew up in. it took me until i am 34 to get it, and you got yours at 21. you worked a summer job plus bartending for 3 years while you were going to school, and you made enough to pay for your college and masters, and for my mom to stay home. this was your life. mine is not that way.
5207	32855	6900	btexev	eox4znt	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	older millennial. i'm poor. we're all poor. fuck this fucking bullshit.
5208	32855	1387	btexev	eoy4wdp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"""back in my day we used too . "" sadly we are not back in your day we are in the future, stuff changes. please realize that"
5209	32855	367	btexev	eoy2x4w	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	the world is dying, prices for everything has skyrocketed, government is corrupt beyond repair and somehow you wonder why we're all depressed edit: typos
5210	32855	3700	btexev	eoybov8	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i can't afford to live on my own. i have a degree, goddammit. i don't have kids, i don't have unnecessary extra expenses to cut out of my life. i just can't afford to live on my own. that's just how our economy is right now. please, stop shaming millennials for needing help to afford housing and food. two incomes are borderline necessary in this economy, so don't try and make me become a housewife. i can't afford to be a housewife. i can't afford children. i can't afford a home. we're not destroying industries like diamonds, magazines, designer handbags, and starter homes. those industries aren't accessible to a lot of us!!!
5211	32855	1839	btexev	eowzpne	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	stem degrees are not a ticket to success. there are like, six stem degrees that equal a well paying job after college. eta: i have a stem degree. my classmates who went into communications, marketing, etc make way more than me  i am disillusioned with the lie that stem=jobs.
5212	32855	102	btexev	eoy5ege	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"getting a job by walking in and talking to the manager. usually you are met with ""did you apply online?"" things aren't like they used to be when it comes to hiring. online applications seem to be more important."
5213	32855	8729	btexev	eowvqti	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we aren't children. we aren't 15 year old kids eating tidepods( the less than 2 dozen that did that). we are college graduates, trade school grads, union workers, and every other slice of the workforce. we have trades, kids, experience, and retirement plans. not as many as should, but the economy the boomers left us is what we have to work with. we aren't stupid kids or out of touch hippies going to college to get degrees in mermaids and avocado toast. we are, it seems, the only damn grownups in the us half the time, and it is exasperating that so many people seem to believe otherwise. edit: thanks for the silver and the gold. i appreciate the support in my old age haha.
5214	32855	91	btexev	eoyatgt	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i'm not a tech wizard i just know how to google things
5215	32855	178	btexev	eoxxbft	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i dream of being able to afford a 100,000 house. i have a college degree and am working on my masters. i make a better wage than a lot of my friends but i literally cannot imagine affording a home. let alone raising children.
5216	32855	394	btexev	eoyg2p9	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	$12 an hour is not a livable wage, not even close. i feel pressured to move away from the state i love because rent is so fucking expensive.
5217	32855	1322	btexev	eoybjzn	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we're not angry 15 year olds.we're angry 30 year olds. we're angry because we can't buy a house. the odds of lots of us *ever* being able to own property are slim because of what previous generations have done to the property market. we're angry about the state our environment is in. things that could've been prevented and haven't been because previous generations have been greedy.pulling coal and oil and other resources from our planet that we don't actually need because we have cleaner methods of producing energy. but those make less money, so who'd want that? we're angry because the animals we've seen in zoos all our lives are going extinct at alarming rates. and the *only* places future generations are *ever* going to see those animals are in zoos. or taxidermied in museums. we're angry because so many people can't afford medical treatment because not everyone can afford appropriate health insurance. so many things could've been prevented but they just haven't been because, y'know, god forbid someone, somewhere doesn't make a fucking buck.
5218	32855	1488	btexev	eox22wn	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	ageism is real form of discrimination.
5219	32855	33076	btexev	eox9ssw	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	ever been to a professional sporting event and groaned at the price of admission, concessions, and even water? its been kind of like living an entire life inside of that stadium.
5220	32855	1037	btexev	eowzsot	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that you need to stand down. there are people in my industry that have been here for 40+ years, and because of that they think they have earned the right to just coast through life till retirement. a lot of their success is built from the younger people working their arses off beneath them.
5221	32855	357	btexev	eox3y21	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	things are different, and thats okay. we talk, socialize, and work very differently then people did even 10 years ago. its not bad; its just different.
5222	32855	224	btexev	eoycei0	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that most of us don't want kids not out of selfishness but because we can't afford them
5223	32855	638	btexev	eoy75wn	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	it is not that hard to update a spreadsheet, brenda. you dont have to create anything. you dont have to format anything. all were asking is for you to type in a box. if you can fill out the forms at your podiatrists office and send an email, you can update a spreadsheet. quit bragging about your willful ignorance as if it was a cute quirk.
5224	32855	1935	btexev	eoxg875	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	please stop trying to get us to go to chilis/applebee's/olive garden. if you make us explain, we'll sound snobby, just.please. stop.
5225	32855	75	btexev	eoy6l8m	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	my first big job was credit card customer service during the housing crisis. shit was really fucked.
5226	32855	617	btexev	eoy0cyw	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"my biggest problem with the current ""such a millennial"" is that i'm a millennial. i'm 37 and i manage a bunch of software engineers for a large software company. we're not young anymore. we aren't struggling because we ""got trophies"" for everything. we're in the workforce and excelling. i manage 23 year olds up to 50+ year olds. i'm just over 2 years out from being able to be discriminated against due to my age. people need to just get over it already. we're no longer the future. we're the now."
5227	32855	273	btexev	eoybn09	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	stop building luxury apartments and condos. please build starter homes.
5228	32855	1011	btexev	eowxjml	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	you expect us to fix the problems you have created and are doing nothing to solve. all of your systems are broken. at least make an attempt.
5229	32855	1755	btexev	eox8zos	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that jobs arent as stable as they used to be. were making way less money than before, its exponentially harder to find a job, and the expectations for the average applicant keeps rising. were now asked to constantly be on call to come back into work. remember that day off you looked forward to all week? nope, boss called you in. you dont show up to said call-in because you arent going to work unless its overtime pay? youre fired. need to find another shitty job for shitty pay. set schedules are never a thing anymore (at least in my experience. even at my research internship i would constantly get called in on weekends when it was stated before that i wouldnt work weekends). were expected to be the most efficient, mindless, obedient generation of citizens and workers. it sometimes seems like were never doing anything because were just so goddamn exhausted that even doing daily tasks is a struggle. were asked to constantly be working efficiently even away from work. rest isnt a thing anymore. our generation is getting burnt out and sick of the issues that order generations dumped on us, yet were blamed as the ones who caused the problems. op keeps asking what solutions we can bring, and the only thing i can think of that will really solve the countrys financial problems is to just wait for the boomers to die off. its a bit morbid to say but its true. theres just too many people and not enough money to go around. unfortunately the younger generation (millennials, genz) has to bear the burden of 2008s economic clusterfuck. sorry for the rant. edit: this blew up holy shit. some naysayers replying to me saying im asking for too much or i should be grateful im working. i am grateful to work. is it too much to ask that my life and my work have stability? the older generation had a lot of stability and consistency in their jobs. we dont get that luxury. yes ive worked retail but that was before i declared my chem major. i now work at a small research lab and have a side job as something to do during the summer so im not bored. its not that i want handouts (and quite the opposite i want to earn what i get), its just that i want to be able to know that i wont be laid off at the drop of a hat because my boss decided to spam my inbox and voicemail demanding me to come in when we specifically agreed for weekends off as i got the job. unless its overtime compensation im not showing up. any reasonable person would agree with me on that. /rant part 2
5230	32855	5596	btexev	eox47l1	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	this is for the older people. yes you are wiser than us. yes, you have more experience than us. but your advice usually does not apply to the times. thats not how we did it back in the day. yea. thats the point grandma. times change. people change. technology changes. dont get mad at us because we lived in a time of increasing convenience. and most importantly, its ironic how millennials are viewed in a bad light but we are expected to solve all the worlds problems. edit: i understand that old age usually does not come with wisdom. but man the older people ive come across say the wisest things. and for the most part they do know what theyre talking about. there are a few old people who talk out of their a** but for the most part, wisdom runs through their blood. edit: this was my first day on reddit after 30 days and in that time period i earned 7,000 karma and a silver award. thanks so much.
5231	32855	582	btexev	eoxql6p	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we dont get online just to chat or play mindless games. we like to read & learn. we just know how to make it fun.
5232	32855	71	btexev	eoyambp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	my wife and i are both salaried engineers working at good companies. we have no kids and still can't afford a home or condo where we live. i have absolutely no idea how people actually afford raising a family now.
5233	32855	2282	btexev	eoxeyi2	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we're not depressed because we're weak, we're depressed because the world is literally shit
5234	32855	65	btexev	eoyj83r	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"i've been at my current company for nearly six years now, in that time i've been promoted once and my salary has increased nearly 60%. that's makes me a massive exception among my circle of friends. most of them graduated around the same time as me (about 7 years ago) and are on their third or fourth job, one of them is starting his fifth job in six years after the summer. one guy spent three years at a job because they kept telling him he needed to put in the time in order to get promoted. when he finally left he had gotten two raises of 1.5% each in those three years, and his older colleagues said he was leaving ""for the money"" because his new job offered him 15% more than what he was earning. even when he took that offer to his boss he still didn't get offered the promotion they promised him when he started there. the reason millennials aren't loyal to companies anymore isn't because we're out for ourselves, it's because companies have been systematically abusing the expected loyalty to string employees along, nickel and diming them every step of the way."
5235	32855	128	btexev	eoy87lu	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	you can't pause an online game
5236	32855	276	btexev	eoxywic	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that being a raging cunt won't make your restaurant bill magically go down in price. i'm not saying all baby boomers are guilty of this, but they seem to be the majority of people who try this stunt.
5237	32855	117	btexev	eoy9vpp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we're not having a baby boom of our own because we're responsible enough to not bring children into a world we can't afford to live in.
5238	32855	188	btexev	eoy3dm9	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we want to get married, buy a house, have children, all the things our forefathers did, but we can barely afford to keep ourselves going. add to that the worsening political and actual climate and we're all pretty hopeless.
5239	32855	999	btexev	eoy01zf	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	despite what news networks or studies say generations can vary greatly. i was born in 96 but am considered a millennial where i'm from because it's all back woods and technology gets here a little slower. if i was in a city in a more advanced area i'd be gen z. i had chalkboards in elementary school, whiteboards and a few smart boards in middle school and then back to white boards in high school. computers were put in my school when i was in 5th grade. i saved to a floppy disk. i know what it feels like to take a big rubber dodge ball to the face. you kind of get the point. we don't expect things to be handed to us, we just want affordable access to things. my parents were able to buy a house at 19 and support two children on a full time and a part time income. granted it was a struggle sometimes. i'm 23, work about 80 hours a week (it varies based on staffing), plus go to school and can't afford rent in my area. my current job did require education already. i can't afford to go to the doctor despite working in healthcare. we aren't lazy like the news says, we work our assess off just to get nowhere. i have three days off this month, plus school. those of us who don't want children don't hate children, we know we can't afford to raise them. we are inheriting a fucked up economy, a dying plant and get nothing but shit because were just lazy and entitled. not to mention in the us were straight up getting our rights taken away. were pretty angry about it. edit: shit man someone gave me silver. thanks! y'all are just trying to make me blush now. i've never gotten awards and now i have 2!? now were on 3 guys. i'm starting to feel like i'm important or something. i can't keep up with you guys! thanks so much!
5240	32855	140	btexev	eoxz1ei	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	gen z here. for some reason older people seem to confuse 13 year olds and like 25 year olds.
5241	32855	95	btexev	eoy6p9y	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	most of us arent influencers who go to coachella
5242	32855	560	btexev	eox2g9c	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we are not gen z.i'm 30, have a career, an apartment, own my own car.we are the 15 year olds with fidget spinners eating tide pods. we didn't always have the internet at home, we played outside when we were kids and we remember 9/11 as an event not something in a text book.
5243	32855	48	btexev	eoyrcrm	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	jobs aren't guaranteed. my brother worked for a big surf clothing company for almost 8 years as their big tech guy. paid well, occasional travel, discounts. good job. said company has been doing massive layoffs since he got there. mostly people who'd been there forever. he got scared when the guy who'd been there 10y got let go so he looked elsewhere but they liked him and matched his offers twice. finally this month he got laid off. out of nowhere. scary stuff. he's on unemployment but he has enough saved that he'll be fine for a while. pretty sure it only happened because he'd been there so long and was paid so well. i think their strategy is to constantly bring in new people who they can pay less to save money. it's stupid.
5244	32855	164	btexev	eoyagqv	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that there are still only 24 hours in a day. i remember being in my mid-twenties and working three jobs, plus a volunteer position at a tv studio to boost my resum, to the point where i literally finished working at the first place, changed uniforms in my car, then drove to the second place and started my next shift. the weekends played out the exact same only i drove to a third place. i was literally living on about 3 hours of sleep a night, working 7 days a week and only making an equivalent to a full time cashiers wage. by the time i had paid my weeks rent, groceries (the bare necessities), fuel and transport, i had twenty dollars left over. i was even selling stuff on the side through etsy but it only made me petty change. i had nothing to contribute to savings and had zero social life. but of course, all my older coworkers are telling me to just get another job, work harder, and to stop being so entitled.
5245	32855	130	btexev	eoyaoev	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	what its like to graduate from college into the worst financial crisis since the great depression.
5246	32855	252	btexev	eoy34fg	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we will be the first generation that will never be able to retire. most of us have no kids, no pensions, no savings, only started working in our late 20's, and by the time we retire, if we make it to old age ,we will likely work until we get too weak or senile, and then be stocked away in a state facility somewhere, 4 beds to a room, with not enough money to even own a cell phone. just stare at the wall alone miserable waiting to die. no kids or relatives left to visit us or help remind us who we are. just rotting away losing our minds &#x200b; i spent the past 10 years or so mostly working for retired people. nice folks, but very demanding and constantly complaining about their pensions and retirement funds not being high enough to do more travelling or other things, but most of them live in paid-off homes that they own and their pensions and retirements is giving them a really decent lifestyle. something that will not exist for me. and millions of others my age. we are just expected to work right into the grave, no rewards. &#x200b; but those old people still expect us to rush and huff and puff and answer to every little demand and criticism. like a good little slave. only existing to serve them, and to hell what happens to us when we reach that age.
5247	32855	616	btexev	eox9t0j	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	our planet is dying and i think we need to fix that
5248	32855	41	btexev	eoxzw93	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i'm not a lazy, entitled person! i've worked 2 jobs and min 50hr work weeks my entire life. sorry you could support a family of 5 on a single person's income. i struggle to make rent & pay crippling student loans. sorry if you think my generation fucked up the economy though
5249	32855	44	btexev	eoy7btp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that a lot of people who make fun of millennials don't realize that they are also in fact millennials.
5250	32855	40	btexev	eoyb81i	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we are ruining industries because we are poor and cant afford extraneous purchases.
5251	32855	40	btexev	eoyf9tk	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	baby boomers screwed over the millennials big time. cheap primary, secondary and university education? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. once these people grew up, they wanted nothing to do with high taxes to support cheap university education, especially. so they drew up the ladder of educational opportunity and more or less said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us these great educational benefits without us taking on any student debt. so we got ours! now youre on your own! world-class infrastructure? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. well-kept highways, bridges, tunnels, and subway systems are for young people to use, not old people since most old people are going to be dead soon. bridges that are well-kept, for example? those last 50 years, and will mostly benefit the young. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us great infrastructure, but that means we have to pay higher taxes to keep this up. but we dont want to pay for that! now youre on your own! cheap housing in large cities bursting with economic opportunity? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. now that the baby boomers are old and have lots of property in these citiesespecially nice coastal cities like san francisco and new yorkthey dont want high-density anything because it destroys the character of the neighborhood. the worst of the worst nimbyist people are baby boomers who got in on this urban property pretty cheaply 40 years ago or so. and they want to keep those property valuations way up. so that means no high-density anything, which means crazy high property prices and very high rents. and who bears the burden of this? the young, the people trying to start their careers. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us cheap property in cities, but now we dont want our property values to go down, even a bit. so no to high-density development, no to apartments, no to affordable housing! now youre on your own! this is the harsh truth millennials must face: the old are screwing us, the young, big time. and the old dont like hearing this harsh, harsh truth because they dont like to see themselves as the bad guys who achieved much lower taxes after the 1980s by ruthlessly cutting back on things that benefit the young, the things they themselves enjoyed when they were whippersnappers. the national debt is zooming upwards, and we the young are going to be paying for that, not the baby boomers who will soon depart. the old are always the victims, but never the bad guys.
5252	32855	110	btexev	eoy3z8a	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i remember at 28 i tried to get a job and when i told my mother the pay she just shrugged and said yeah pretty standard. this was for assistant to a foreign ambassador's mission to the eu. my dad will retire and his replacement taking over the same job will be paid half what he made. he will never be able to climb to the same level. the truth is that if a millenial wants their parents' standard of living one needs to hustle, go into a high paying field or move to a different country. the worst thing about being a millenial is it is embarrassing to hustle, to struggle, to be poor, to reuse etc. we are supposed to keep shoving coal into the sinking ship of our society. all the while smiling that we can afford a lower deck cabin.
5253	32855	169	btexev	eox9rk6	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	economic advice and plans that worked for you when you were a teenager/young adult in the 60s or 70s doesn't apply in this economy. stop telling me to go into buildings and ask for a job and invest in a middle class home at age 30.
5254	32855	109	btexev	eoy9xa0	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"we will absolutely undo just about everything boomers did politically. i look at these old ignorant politicians and just think ""oh just die already"" also my fellow generation please learn to use basic tools and google your home issues first. i don't want to charge you 600 dollars to tighten a screw but i will. cause tradesmen are dying and soon 600 dollar repairs will be a bargain. i want to fuck over the boomers not you. learn to fix shit."
5255	32855	39	btexev	eoy4eh4	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	graduating from college looking for a job, when all the baby boomers and people of those kind of generations arent retiring from their jobs. thus not freeing up the job market. then they complain that we cant get jobs! well i wonder why, karen!
5256	32855	38	btexev	eoyck7u	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i have a college degree and work full time, 40-50 hours per week, and if i lived alone i would qualify for welfare benefits. i might even still qualify for welfare benefits.
5257	32855	37	btexev	eoyfufg	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	when you see me sitting on the bus staring at my phone, rather than reading the paper or talking to my friend, don't be disappointed, because i'm very likely *doing that exact thing, but through the magic of technology.*
5258	32855	37	btexev	eoyilqo	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we're poor. like actually poor. soon almost nobody will own any homes and they'll all be owned by an elite few.
5259	32855	36	btexev	eoykphm	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"""drive around and drop your resume off to different companies if you want a job. show some ambition. the managers and executives will like that."" &#x200b; first of all, debbie, i tried that. the one company that actually accepted my paper resume had no idea what i was talking about when i called a couple days later to follow up."
5260	32855	298	btexev	eowyr82	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	what it's like having to still live with a roommate into our 20's because the economy is so bad, that that is the only way to afford rent and still be able to put food on the table.
5261	32855	213	btexev	eox55gp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"many of us are not cynical. previous generations made lots of attempts at improving every substantial system out there, made lots of improvements, but none of those systems are perfect. many of us are actively working to improve them. every generation must address problems that previous generations could not solve/created. basically, we aren't lazy and are doing our best to solve problems in spite of levels of debt relatively unknown to previous generations, a global climate crisis that is the result of 200 years of irresponsibility, and what many of us view as a (small but powerful) class of stubborn plutocrats who desperately cling to power while having no substantive ideas regarding the fundamental challenges of our time (most of which are not ""culture war"" issues). we are educated, conscientious about the world and history, open to a wide variety of ways of living, and improving every day. our generation is slowly taking the reins of power and i personally cannot wait to see what kinds of solutions we implement. also i still think that the idea of ""generations"" is a bullshit artificial distinction. people are born every day and arbitrary demarcations aren't helpful."

5264	32855	1064	btexev	eowsfhk	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	college is a fucking scam 85% of the time. education is great but debt slavery is ruining our lives.
5265	32855	297	btexev	eoy0cav	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	respect isnt something you deserve because youre older than me. respect is earned. ** edit **  my first gold! thank you kind stranger
5266	32855	105	btexev	eoxl3wy	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we are one of the most educated yet underpaid generations. my grandparents were able to buy a three bedroom home in toronto for $16,000. that same home is now worth $800,000. i can not afford that on a $40,000 a year job. but i went to school for four years and graduated with honours. yay me.
5267	32855	99	btexev	eoxedei	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	were not lazy. many of us work 2 or more jobs to support our families. we dont take sick days cause who can afford that and we bust our butts to make a living. just because you could go to college and pay for it plus save up doing a part time job at the library doesnt make us lazy for having loans.
5268	32855	52	btexev	eoy9lmi	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	pokmon go is better than real life. thats why im on my phone.

5271	32855	26	btexev	eoybmwz	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that your age and position doesn't mean you get my respect, karen and robert. there's this power dynamic that i only see within the boomer generation, where if you're younger than them and you're not like their doctor or something, you have to be subservient to them, the total stranger. what's the timeframe where the boomers are going to retire in mass? next 15 years? wandering gangs calling themselves the boomers, wearing boat shoes and chasing after younger people for their medication. imagine the baby boomers complaining now.and then imagine how bad it'll be when they don't have anything else better to do.
5272	32855	27	btexev	eoyjp5c	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"as someone on the older end of being a millennial who's managed to be fairly successful, while i will take credit for ""creating opportunity"" (being a go getter, skilling up, etc) fact is luck played as much if not more in my success. the days of simply being a professional and getting your degree resulting in a lucrative job are long gone. (not that you shouldn't do those things, just that used to be the finish line with a job at the end of it, now it's the starting line for a lot of careers) i will also say even my advice is probably already outdated to the point of no longer useful things have change so much, advice for the 50 and 70s is all but useless in modern times. toss into the pot it now takes two full time workers in decent paying jobs to buy an okay house and that's if you're in good health and manage to get lucky enough to get a decent job. (and that was before jacked up tuition rates and student loans killed that option) fact is while i'm a millennial those of us from 1980 to 2000 have had it leagues easier than those after 2000, and honestly i'm expecting things to get way worse before better. the sad fact is, if things don't change our future is looking really grim, yet we look at our parents living it up thanks to the situation they grew up in, and frankly we're jealous, frustrated, and upset, and yet we're looked down on as if we're to blaim for the shit show we've inherited, and when we try to come up with solutions we're told ""nope, you dumb kids are narcissists who just want hand outs"". i don't want a hand out, i want people who work 40 hours a week teaching to at least be able to not starve to death it some gutter, i think that's a pretty &$!?# low bar. yet even that appears to be too big an ask right now."
5273	32855	29	btexev	eoyov5b	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	millennials started in 1981. i was born a year later. the generation(s) before me made sure school was unaffordable, health care unreasonable, housing impossible, the environment unlivable, had no problem endorsing two never ending wars for my generation to fight in, and really, wed just appreciate you all stfu when we complain about all the afore mentioned things. seriously, shut the fuck up with all your back in my day bullshit. we may have smart phones, but we also have the grimmest outlook for the future in any generation in modern history. as someone born in 82, a veteran of multiple silly wars you voted for, with no hope to ever buy a home, barely able to afford rent if i want to live in an area with actual jobs: fuck you. vote out of self interest for once; vote in the interest of the americans that will follow.
5274	32855	404	btexev	eowt1d8	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	baby boomers: born 1946-1964 generation x: born 1965-1980 millennials: born 1981-1996 post-millennials: born 1997-present
5275	32855	73	btexev	eoxvgdk	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we aren't having children, buying houses, or buying new cars as early or often as you did because we can't afford to yet.
5276	32855	72	btexev	eoy99xp	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"it's not only out of vogue to put two spaces after a period but it's improper. (word processing programs already extend the spaced area between sentences/after a period.) ""but we learned it this way and it's hard to change."" so did we; we're ~30 and had to unlearn too."
5277	32855	199	btexev	eoxbpma	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	if you allow us to participate as equals in government and corporate management, we can innovate the promised future you failed to give us. a future that will work for everyone, not just us. edit: rephrased the response to make sense with the op.
