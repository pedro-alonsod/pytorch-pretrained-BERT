"as a caveat, i do work in the medical industry though not specifically mental health. this girl's mother was sexually abused as a child, so the parents were very overprotective. they wouldn't allow the girl to be alone with any males other than the father. no uncles, no cousins, no church trips, nothing. they could sleep over at friend's houses if the friend's mother was a single mom, and if that other mom took on transportation duties. the parents were also somewhat disengaged though not to the point of neglect. just distant, wouldn't play, wouldn't go the library. stay at home and leave us alone while we watch tv kind of parents. shut up or i'll give you something to cry about. life isn't fair, get used to it. there were three neighbor kids all a little bit older. a boy a year older, and two girls about four and six years older. they had a single mom, and since the girl was five years old, they lived on the same street. the girl was encouraged to spend a lot of time there. to get her out of the house and not to beg for dance lessons or to go to the park. there was no man of that house, but that single mom was not a good mom. she drank or used drugs, and had a lot of men over some of whom clearly had molested those kids. as a lot of older children or young teenagers do, they took out their pain of their molestation on this younger smaller girl. it went on for four to five years. the little girl never told her parents because she had no reason to think they would care. she was pretty isolated other than her interaction with her molesters, and obviously she didn't understand what was happening when it started. schools talked about stranger danger, and adults touching you in your bathing suit spots, but nothing about older children of the same sex. nothing about being forced to watch pornography, or masturbate in front of people. nothing about how it escalates from there into being touched, or being pressured to have sex with their kid brother. nothing about the coersion of a desperate lonely child hearing ""do it or i won't be your friend anymore"" from the only people they can spend time with. it was a really sad combination of disengaged yet overprotective parents. the girl ended up being bullied by classmates because she didn't know how to interact in a normal way. was taken advantage of by a teacher in middle school, then abused in every way by a few boyfriends after that. had a drug problem, got clean, but still couldn't seem to keep it together for more than a few years at a time before work or personal relationships would implode. was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder."

"i'm not a mental health professional, but back in 2010, while i was a volunteer worker for a brazilian ngo, sometimes they would send us to different locations and countries to support some project or to learn from it and apply the concept back to brazil. one time i was sent to chile, to help out in a community project. and i was supposed to get my meals in an orphanage near there. but that orphanage was not a normal one, it was specific for kids that had been abused. at the beginning some of them were afraid of me (i'm a fat black guy). but after a while they got used to see me around. before coming there, they explained all the details and how to behave, but nothing can actually prepare you for that. i saw a 7 year old that was trying to ""seduce"" me, because she was taugh by her dad to act this way her whole life. i saw another that was constantly raped through her life, and refused to smile, cause her father always told her to smile while he was raping. one of them was completely silent, and the staff didn't know exactly what happened to her. the list goes on and on. and it is depressing and morbid. i don't have a word powerful enough to describe what happened to those kids. and the worst part is that most of the things that happened to them, was caused by their own parents, that was too fucked up. i was supposed to get my meals there for the whole month. but i couldn't. i started to pay my meals directly from my pocket. their reality was too much for me to deal with."

"i formerly worked as a psychiatric doctor. i can honestly say the most common denominator amongst my most seriously ill patients was a traumatic childhood. physical, emotional, sexual abuse, adverse life experiences, homelessness, all of these leave imprints which can be very difficult to erase. i have so many times interacted with patients described as ""troublesome"", ""threatening"", ""aggressive"" - the reasons of which become as clear as day when looking at their backgrounds. if anyone out there is going through tough times, please try to reach out, even though that may seem impossible. the earlier you seek help, the easier the path to recovery."

"it wasn't a professional but more of a volunteer thing. it was such a ""wasted potential"" of a person. the girl was a child born of adultery, so unwanted. she was going to be put up for adoption--a loving family was waiting for her, but because of an impulsive decision in the moment she wasn't. her mother (who had, understandably, been divorced by her husband) was now a single mom of a child she hated and proceeded to horribly abuse her in twisted, sick ways. think a degree or two below ""a child called it"". she also allowed/enabled a male relative to sexually abuse her for years. now this is horrible enough as it is, but here's the ""lost potential"" part. the girl is/was a genius. she was skipped, i believe, 4 grades in school (which did also damage a lot of her social development as well), and this was a time and place skipping grades was more commonplace. but due to all the horrible abuse, she developed severe eating disorders and self-harm and as a result, very serious physical health issues. she was also a very kind, loving person who wanted to go into the medical field, but ultimately was unable to. she seems to be managing ok now, but i just think of the great loss she suffered, and what sort of better life she could've had if she was just adopted. and what she could have achieved for herself and humanity with a mind and heart like that."

"my experience is so much different than everyone else here as it wasn't family that caused the trauma, it was nature. during one of the 3 massive tornadoes we've had since 2010 my team was deployed to an area and told that we had elementary school children trapped in the school. we worked our way through debri searching every square inch to make sure we didn't miss a thing. when we uncovered the basement we found that it was flooded and full of kids who were alive and children/teachers who didn't make it due to drowning. most people don't realize how much rain we get with our tornadoes in the midwest. when my city (joplin missouri) was hit by a multi vortex ef5 tornado on may 22nd 2011 we had a torrential downpour for 2 or 3 days after it. anyway, back to the school. we recovered the living & the bodies and flew them out to a larger hospital for treatment. i gave them medical attention on scene and started what's known as ""psychological first aid"" because i knew these kids were fucked from what they saw & experienced. every few months i reached out to family members of the children to check and see how they were doing (weird maybe but the last time i saw these kids they weren't in great shape. the kids were able to recover for the most part and things were going good, i thought. i learned that 3 of the kids started massive drug addictions when they got into junior high and at least 2 of them had attempted suicide. it tore me apart because i'm now a father myself and i saw what these kids experienced, all the while hoping they wouldn't be affected long term. i fear the future because these kids who are now in middle school & high school started doing some pretty horrible things to address the pain & nightmares they live daily. i honestly wish i could do more because these kids never had a chance and it was no one's fault, no one could have predicted what happened and what would happen. we learned a lot about tornadoes with this particular tornado, the tornado that hit my town, and the 2nd tornado that hit the town the kids were in. we'll never again send kids to the hallway or basements because pop machines, water fountains etc get sucked down the hallways, kids get sucked out of hallways, and basements fill with water during these events. i see these kids in my sleep, i see the people they've grown up to be but somehow i still see the soaked, filthy children with tears running down their faces, blood soaking their clothes, and i can feel how tight they dug their nails into me as they hugged & held on for dear life, not wanting us to let them go because they were terrified that it would happen again. it's not family induced trauma but it's the one thing in my career that sticks out more than anything."

6499	28574	21	bo6854	ened7sn	"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	oh man so many. people vastly underestimate the impact of our childhood experiences and how they play a role in how we function later on in life. the one that stands out the most, for me, even if it's not the most fucked up, is probably the woman who was gangraped by her brother and her dad and several others (they used butter as a lubricant) who has never established a healthy relationship with her family or any other person in her life due to this. her mom didn't believe her. she later fell into drugs, and never really recovered. there's also been several cases i've had of young men (13-17 usually) who were sent to juvie for legitimately dumb shit who were then terrorized, sexually and physically assaulted repeatedly, who now can't live with anybody and sleep with knives under their pillows. in my state several facilites have shut down over this. community mental health is a black hole of fucked up; you always think you've seen/heard the saddest thing and then you meet a new person with a new story.

"it was during my student clinical and i dont want to into too many details, but there was a patient (somewhere around 20ish. dont remember exactly) who was pimped out by her dad (or at least she called dad, no idea if actually related) and would share details. our instructor didnt want us around her because she often didnt realize what was super inappropriate to say and the staff said sometimes she would get extremely graphic . the one thing thatll stick out is when she first mentioned it, she said how the ""mommies would come over and get her ready for the daddies and johnnies"". she was the most amazing pianist, all self taught by hearing but definitely could be concernt pianist"
6503	28574	20	bo6854	endyqnz	"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	i'm stilling completing my training, but, sadly, i think the saddest case of this isn't from a patient, but a good friend. they have an intensely negative schema around their own self-worth, their capabilities, and the degree to which his friends are genuine when we try to support him. after talking to him, it's clear this all stems from difficult childhood experiences around being born premature leading to life long medical issues, being raised as an only child in a highly neurotic, outcome obsessed family, and pretty constant bulling. &#x200b; now, this isn't the most shocking or anything (i can think of a few more shocking cases), but i think it makes me feel the saddest because i sometimes feel like i've had this upfront seat of watching him repeatedly get thwarted and fall into spirals of self-hatred and despair. plus, it's all too common of an experience.

6505	28574	20	bo6854	ene97sn	"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	had a patient that was practically locked away by their father. no contact with the outside world and extremely limited time outside. they spent most waking hours studying literacy because the father believed them to have a gift for writing that had to be nurtured at the cost of their life. unfortunately that wasn't the last case like that that i've seen.
