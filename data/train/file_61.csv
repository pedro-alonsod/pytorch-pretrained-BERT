4820	34674	17477	bmlzqs	emy4aiv	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i had a really uneven trim with a couple of bald patches in it once, so i just asked the barber to shave my head completely and i'd start over from zero. he tried to charge me for both haircuts, but i refused to double dip.
4821	34674	1425	bmlzqs	emybn7q	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was about 6 we had a mobile hairdresser who came to our house. i was a real tomboy so mum asked them to cut my hair fairly short. when i saw in the mirror i ran outside, climbed a tree and refused to come down for a couple of hours. i think my views were clearly transmitted
4822	34674	11469	bmlzqs	emy91ja	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked for a skin fade that tapers into what i have on top. she went down to skin alllllll the way up. told her this isn't what i asked for, she got snarky and said i needed to be clearer next time. i paid the bill after she shortened the top to better match the now bald sides of my head. i may not know all the names for barber equipment, but i've been getting this haircut for years and literally everyone but her was able to produce what i requested.
4823	34674	695	bmlzqs	emy7ttj	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	never complained about a haircut. but once when i was halfway thru and the women who was just before me that had the same lady came back and started complaining about how my current hairlady did a terrible job and she wanted her money back. my hairlady and complaining lady get into a heated argument about how complaining lady was talking on her phone the whole time and this caused the bad cut. thought they were about to take it outside. &#x200b; really a terrible situation to be in. half cut hair, an emotionally charged haircutlady, and not the best feeling about haircutlady. quite awkward. thank you supercuts
4824	34674	3478	bmlzqs	emy69z1	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i chose a new style that, as it turns out, i didn't like how it looked on me upon completion. no fault of his, i just didn't like what i chose. didn't really fit me like i thought it would. i had him shave it bald and had him try something else several months later. much better. i'll still have him experiment from time to time, even be his guinea pig for something he wants to try.
4825	34674	6566	bmlzqs	emyefwq	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	had a barber offer a 'hot towel shave' at the end of my haircut because he was trying to kill a few extra minutes before he clocked out without having to take another waiting customer. barber used a mach 3 razor and absolutely butchered my face. half way through the shave people just kept staring at me with blood running down my face while the barber was packing some corn starch bullshit in the scrapes/cuts. he said 'wow, you have really sensitive skin' and i replied 'most skin is sensitive when you fucking remove it with a razor'. i just pulled the towel off and walked out of the shop, bloody, half shaved and fully pissed off. my brother thought i got jumped on my way there was so much blood on my shirt/neck. best part is, i only got the haircut for professional headshots being taken the next day. yeah, that didn't happen. shitty part is, guy was my go-to barber for a few years. haven't been back since. edit: a word edit 2: obligatory thanks for the silver stranger, my first one. *sniffle*
4826	34674	9165	bmlzqs	emxtxyb	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i didnt say anything cause all my hair was gone (asked for a 5 all over, she thought i said 0)
4827	34674	12006	bmlzqs	emy7rfc	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i wanted a buzz cut. she was not willing to cut off that much hair, assuming i'd be upset and get angry. seven times she trimmed off a millimeter and asked me if it was okay. i went out, bought myself a pair of clippers, had a buzzed head in about 12 minutes, and have not been back to a barber since.
4828	34674	10176	bmlzqs	emyadwo	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"she shaved my side burns up to about an inch and a half above my ear. i didn't say anything, just sat there looking pissed. she goes ""it'll look good if you put some gel in it."". i went up front to pay, thought about not paying, paid anyway. 4 people got up and left behind me who were waiting. never again mastercuts. never. again. edit: i had to wear a beanie for a month during a hot summer in ga until they grew back. a baseball cap wouldnt cut it. my boss was against me wearing a beanie at work initially until i took it off."
4829	34674	4693	bmlzqs	emxzd14	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"not me, but my dad. &#x200b; went to get our hair cut before a soccer game back when i was about 12. got mine first, was fine. sat down while dad got his hair cut. cue the barber doing the usual holding the mirror asking if everything looks good, my dad sits still for a minute quietly and says sternly: ""that's the worst fucking haircut i've ever had in my fucking life."". everyone just sat there for what seemed like 10 minutes before we just got up and walked out, nothing else was said. i was beyond fucking embarrassed, and the haircut seemed like the same fucking haircut my dad had gotten since 1980 - no better or worse. still not sure if he just did it to avoid paying, which would be *very* likely, but he maintains to this day it was a fucking terrible haircut."
4830	34674	2461	bmlzqs	emygher	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i once was in the seat next to a guy who said: ""yeah it's fine thank you."" when he stood up and turned around i could clearly see his anger in the reflection of the mirror."
4831	34674	2373	bmlzqs	emy8zov	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a kid, my dad and i would go to the local barber. however, once i became a pre-teen (when you become self-conscious about your hair) my dad and i both noticed our haircuts were getting shittier and shittier. the next time we went i watched the barber focused on what the barber was doing while cutting hair to see if i could identify what he was doing wrong. it turns out he had become so complacent that he would fixate on the cubs' game on the tv hanging from the ceiling while cutting hair, not even looking at the person's head. i told him it sucked and never went back
4832	34674	8029	bmlzqs	emxvma8	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	im someone who hates bangs, they dont look nice on me and they annoyingly tickle my forehead. every time i meet my barber she keeps insisting on giving me bangs and i always say no and it clearly pisses her off until one time she accidentally cut a chunk of my front hair and would have to give me bangs to make it look good now. i knew she did it in purpose cuz she was playing with my front hair for a bit before suddenly making the cut. that was the last time i went to her. thankfully my current barber agrees with me that bangs arent my style. edit: holy shit this blew up. if people must know i didnt tip her and didnt have to pay the extra time it took to cut the bangs but it did take me a whole year to finally grow it out and get the style i wanted.
4833	34674	10075	bmlzqs	emy5s4b	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a kid, my mom would always take me to the same place to get my hair cut, and i would always end up crying because that lady clearly had no idea what she was doing. i didnt even hold it in until i left the place, i would just tell her that i hated the look and start crying. my mom kept taking me there thinking i was just a stupid kid that would never be happy with their haircut. she was wrong. now that ive changed several hairdressers, ive been going to the same one for a few years and i really adore her.
4834	34674	1658	bmlzqs	emy9pp9	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i wanted my hair cut very short. i keep it short now, clipped #1 on the sides and #2 on top. back when this happened i think i asked for a #3 clipper on the sides and finger thickness on top, blended to the sides. she picked up the clippers and popped in a #1 blade and went right over the top of my head like a reverse mohawk and then said 'oops, you wanted a 1 on top right?'. i had to get it #1 all over. this was the day before my friend's wedding that i was going to. i looked like a goon.
4835	34674	237	bmlzqs	emyiglj	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i have really thick hair with natural wave, i also have cancer. over the past couple of years while i've been battling i have had a really hard time getting haircuts because stylists can't seem to face cutting my hair. first haircut after diagnosis, my hair was well past my shoulders and i asked for a pixie cut. when she was done it was still way too long so i asked her to go shorter, she trimmed a lot more and i gave up and said ok. it was still 8 inches long on top and she didn't use clippers. it made a huge mess when it fell out a couple of weeks later. first haircut after finishing chemo the first time my hair had gone curly. my stylist trimmed the absolute minimum she could, i looked like an old lady with a perm. i asked her to go shorter around my ears so it had more shape to it and she said no because it grows slower there. she also would not use clippers. i cried because i hated it so much. second haircut, now back in chemo so my hair was thinning a bit. my husband got a stylist to come to our house. again i asked for a pixie cut, again i had to ask her to go shorter, again no clippers even though i specifically asked for them. last haircut, couldn't face another stylist so i took my husband's clippers to my own head. i made a mess and my husband helped clean it up. now i have a sloppy asymmetrical pixie cut and i am happier with it than any of the others. still not sure what i'm going to do when it needs trimmed again.
4836	34674	2814	bmlzqs	emy3jtz	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"it was a $5 vietnamese joint so expectations were to be tempered, but it was always good enough for me, especially since i'm a dude and i don't need to worry that much about my hair. one time this lady gives me the jim carrey cut in dumb & dumber and i was like, ""yeah, no, uh. how about you just. break it up a little in the front? not so straight?"" she was a good sport about it."
4837	34674	14410	bmlzqs	emxssg1	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	my hairdresser and i had a pretty good relationship, and i had short hair that i wasnt emotional about, so she asked if she could just go wild and surprise me. when i saw the result, id ended up with a weird uneven pixie cut. i told her that it was very cool, but would be too difficult to maintain every day, so could she please cut it down to a regular hairstyle. she redid the cut uncomplainingly, and i walked out happy.
4838	34674	5434	bmlzqs	emy3bha	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"it wasn't a haircut but a blowout. a simple blow out. i was on an anniversary vacation and i wanted to treat myself to a blow out. it was $25. we were staying in a nice inn and i called the recommended salon and booked an appointment. this is a very small town in a place far, far away. the brand new girl was doing it and she had no idea how to do a blow out. i have had them before and she was clueless. i debated what to say and when she turned me around she asked me if i liked it and said ""no"". she called the manager over (might have been owner) and the owner started to argue with me that stylists have their own style to do blowouts. the manager re-did my blowout in 1/3 of the time and she did it right. the new girl checked me out and i told her that it was the manager's duty to train her and the manager was at fault. i asked her not to feel bad but to demand to be trained so that she could become as great as she wanted to be. i paid the bill of $25 and tipped the new girl $15. that poor new girl was not equipped and was not being supported. i hope she continued and asked for her training."
4839	34674	1961	bmlzqs	emyhzy2	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	im a guy and have long hair. i usually go to a female hairdresser at a salon but i had recently moved to a new place and found this highly rated barber shop that did cuts and shaves and i decided to give it a chance. i called ahead and asked if anyone there was comfortable cutting long hair and if so to make me an appointment with them. i went in with my hair about halfway down my back and said i wanted it just above my shoulders. the big thing was it had to be long enough to be pulled back and out of my face (it was necessary for my work). this guy nods and proceeds to start cutting just below my ears. my hair is curly and so curled up even higher as soon as he let go. he got about halfway around my head cutting a straight line before my expression made him go get someone else. the only female at the shop came over and audibly gasped. she tried to fix it but it was terrible. had to wear a bandana or hat at work for the next 3 months while it grew back out. the manager asked and i told him i was very disappointed and that they should have just admitted they dont do that kind of cut upfront. oh and they gave me a $5 discount and told me to please come again -_-
4840	34674	3755	bmlzqs	emy3u3n	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i go to a place near my work. it's the standard barber shop staffed by vietnamese people. i've been going there for years and they are very nice. there is one guy who works there and he is great. i always use him, even if i have to wait. one day i was in a hurry, had no time to wait. so i elected to have one of the girls cut my hair. well. she didn't do it right and it looked awful. i told her. ""it's not working."" so i had her get the clippers out and told her to shave my entire head at ""1"" so i could ""reset"" my hair."
4841	34674	10056	bmlzqs	emxtslw	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	sixteen years old and just about to get my dl. go to the salon to get my haircut nice for the picture. instead of feathering my hair (i know i'm dating myself here) the stylist gives me a spiky buzz cut on top. i was so upset i just sat in her chair and cried. way too short to fix. it was truly awful. stylist gets offended and starts giving all these excuses. i just paid and left hiding my hair the best i could. for the next couple months i wore alot of hats. edit: sorry for the confusion dl = drivers license
4842	34674	18260	bmlzqs	emy3vlo	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a young teen, 15 or 16, i had hair down to my belly button. i wanted it cut to my collar bone because my hair is thick and hard to take care of. my normal hairdresser was delayed into our appointment due to one of the dying hair things breaking and the other being taken so i was paired with a different one. this girl couldn't do an even cut. she kept trying. so she kept cutting so one side would be 3+ inches longer than the other. i watched in the mirror in horror, speechless. she eventually sees my face and goes to get my normal hairdresser. my normal hairdresser just gives me a sad look and says she has to even me out and that she was sorry. she had to cut it to my ears. she didnt ask if i like it. she just said i didn't have to pay. my eyes were watering by that point. it was horrible. never went back.
4843	34674	6128	bmlzqs	emxm4x0	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	this only happened to me once. i'm not sure how she did so badly on my hair. it was all weird and uneven and she missed parts which is hard to do when you're just getting a classic crewcut. she was super young though so maybe it was a lack of experience. i politely told her no this wasn't going to work but it was going to be ok. i got up, paid and left her a tip (she did her best). then i drove down the street to another hair place and had someone there fix it. hopefully she either got better at her job or chose a different career path. i now no longer go to great clips or any of those types of quick haircut shops. i go to the same stylist over and over which is fun because it's like we're having these long conversations with month long gaps between them. plus she gives me a beer each time i sit down to get a trim.
4844	34674	589	bmlzqs	emygbj6	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	as a mixed race (half black half white) man, i find that i never like my haircuts. my hair is very curly, but also wavy, so neither white barbers or black barbers know what to do with it. there was only one time i liked my haircut, it was cut by a latino man. i went back a few months later to get it cut by the same guy to find out that he moved. i started cutting my own hair, and let me tell you, its impossible to get an even fro when you cut it yourself. i gotta find me a guy.
4845	34674	1479	bmlzqs	emy2tol	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	my hair is pretty short so there's not much to mess up. i get it cut often cuz my hair grows thick and i have to maintain it for the military, so i tend to go wherever i can get in quick and cheap. i like it really short on the sides; like if lacroix cut hair, that level of hair-to-scalp ratio. just a hint. but the last time, i was out of state and stopped by a rinky dink little barber shop. after i got it cut, the lady flipped me around to look in the mirror (i was facing away) and it looked like almost none was cut off. so i asked her to cut more, and she reluctantly agreed. once again it was way too long. so finally i just told her 'just cut it all off' because now i was not only fed up with my thick hair, but my haircut experience. finished up and left. i still left with it longer than i normally like it.
4846	34674	372	bmlzqs	emyiywy	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	after years of wasting money on horrible to unsatisfactory haircuts, i invested in a good clipper set, watched a few youtube videos and trim my own hair now. my initial thought was, if i mess it up, a) at least it won't be paying someone for it, and b) i can always do a crew cut 3 years later, best $30 investment ever. went from decent to pretty good at cutting my own hair.
4847	34674	10894	bmlzqs	emy3fpr	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i get my hair cut one day at a school. i get a pretty basic haircut. 1.5 inches on top, shorter on the sides, off the ears. there is a reason i get it cut at 1.5 inches on top, much longer than that it does a weird bozo the clown thing, much shorter than that it just stands straight up. he cut it 1 inch all over my head. i looked like a chia pet.
4848	34674	8069	bmlzqs	emxmyhy	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	got stabbed in the scalp with the scissors. it got stuck there and i had to go to hospital to have it surgically removed. didn't hit anything thank the gods.
4849	34674	168	bmlzqs	emypzgf	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"oh man. this happened to me just last month. i was growing out a pixie and my front hair was down to my chin, and the back was halfway down my neck. i wanted a trim at the back so it could even out with the front hair and look more like a very short bob. now, my fatal mistake was going to a brand spanking new salon. i figured that since i only want a trim from the back, it shouldn't be that hard for any stylist, right? wrong. she fucked up so bad. i swear, she just picked the scissors and went snip in straight lines, like how someone that doesn't know how to cut hair at all would do it at home. i explicitly told her 3 times i want a trim just from the back. she started from the back, and before i knew it, she'd come to the sides and snipped them off. i still remember my growing feeling of dread lol, that okay maybe she's just making it all even. but no. around a couple inches gone of all my hair that i tried so hard to grow out. she went in to blowdry, i stopped her and went home. ugly-cried. took a picture of the back of my head and ugly-cried some more. sent it to my boyfriend, who convinced me to go right up there and ask for a refund. went back, the stylist kept arguing with me that ""a trim means we cut off all the hair, not just the back"" even after agreeing that i told her explicitly that back only. she called her manager, who offered a refund of what's equivalent to roughly $3 (3rd world country). i told her i want $8 or i'm not leaving. i looked like a damn mushroom and told her so. she silently surveyed me, then took out $8 and said ""we're so sorry"". i left and went to one of the most top salons in the city and got another pixie that i love. its still kind of hard growing it all out again when i wasn't mentally prepared to go short again, but it's all okay. https://imgur.com/nrgzwqc.jpg here's a picture right after she cut it and i went home."
4850	34674	322	bmlzqs	emygp93	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i had an important job interview - truly critical. i'd moved to los angeles based on the offer of a lucrative job at my cousin's sound studio - only to have him tell me when i got out here that he had no intention of paying me. so i was broke, and desperate, and only had a part-time gig that wasn't adequate to pay the bills. get an interview at a super cool startup. big money, great job, great company. but i looked kinda shaggy and unkempt, it had been a few months since i got a cut. i was broke, so all i could afford was supercuts. i told the woman i wanted the same cut i've had for ages - short, a #2 on the sides, faded up with some length at the top so my cowlicks don't go crazy. she gets to work.and takes a huge divot out of the back of my head with no guard on the trimmer at all. the only way to ""fix"" it was to shave off the rest, and since it went from the middle of my head to the top, it was impossible to fade in, too. so i just had a whitewall on the sides, leading a sort of half-assed high-and-tight. it looked godawful. she knew it. i told her how important it was i look my best the next day, what was at stake - and that this was seriously going to detract from my professional appearance. she apologized and offered me a free cut to make up for it. like i'd come back for another cut after this disaster! there was nothing to do but gut it out. (i got the job anyway, in a major turning point in my life. months later coworkers asked what was up with my crazy punker haircut when i interviewed. told the story and laughed.)"
4851	34674	1251	bmlzqs	emy81fx	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	can speak for my mom here, her old hair dresser literally had a mental break down while cutting her hair. he just kept cutting and cutting, until my mom started to feel like he was cutting for too long. at the end she had hacks of hair left in random parts of her head. had to use clips and extensions for years after to make it look normal. the same dresser cut a piece of my brothers ear off too. hes a nice guy, just clearly shouldnt be a hair dresser.
4852	34674	654	bmlzqs	emy5ez9	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"when i was 16, i went to the hairdressers with a picture of how i wanted it to look. there was a poster of a girl in the window with a cute hairstyle, but not really my thing -- but the hairdressers convinced me it would be *perfect* with my face shape, ""be brave and try something new!!"", all that bs. i was awkward and reluctantly agreed. it turned out awful. i don't know if the hairdresser was a trainee, or if i just didn't have the right face style after all, but god damn it was the worst hairstyle i've had since i cut my own hair at age 5. i cried. they didn't offer a discount or anything, just told me ""it looks great/you'll get used to it"", the usual. i never went back, and i've cut my own hair ever since, always looking significantly better than that abysmal job."
4853	34674	282	bmlzqs	emyc3kj	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i was 6. my first day of school was the next week. my grandma was convinced that i should be getting a boy-like cut, because that was a thing back in her era. i ended up looking like a boy. i didn't want to. i wanted to have long pretty hair. it took 10 years for it to grow back.
4854	34674	1332	bmlzqs	emxsw39	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	if it's a barber i don't know, i always tell them i want it a little longer in the back just to see their reaction.
4855	34674	137	bmlzqs	emyb2qe	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	just after college i started going to an ultra-cheap salon/barber shop in the decrepit mall where my mom's offiice was. usually the haircuts there were pretty good for the staggering price of $6, but one time instead of the haircut i asked for the stylist gave me a bowl cut and shaved off my sideburns. it made me look uncomfortably like moe howard from the three stooges, and i started getting my hair cut at more expensive places after that.
4856	34674	1023	bmlzqs	emyn7n7	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	for the first 18 years of my life i had my hair done by the same stylist. as soon as i was able to make decisions for myself i would tell her what i wanted done. and every time, without fail, she would ignore my wishes and give me the haircut that she wanted me to have, all the while telling me how she knows better and how i should just be grateful. and to make matters worse she would insist on cutting my hair in the bathroom and sometimes her daughter would come in and pee while i was getting my hair done. i never tipped her once. i guess thats the price you pay when your mom is a hairdresser.
4857	34674	330	bmlzqs	emy69yk	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"my father got his haircut at great clips recently and instead of taking off 1.5"" like he asked they cut his hair to the length of 1.5"". he wore a hat for the next 3 weeks straight."
4858	34674	325	bmlzqs	emy7c25	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i cried cause it was too short. i said a couple of cm he took off inches
4859	34674	227	bmlzqs	emy954r	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i got a simple haircut (i am female), it came out too short. when i show you how long i want my hair, it's the end result on dry hair, not during the haircut on wet hair! but hair grows, so i said i wasn't happy, paid and left. just went to a different place next tine.
4860	34674	891	bmlzqs	emy2yzd	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i'm usually not picky when it comes to haircuts.it's hair after all, it will grow back. i was getting a typical fade about 5 or 6 months ago and this woman, for some reason, faded each side of my head in different spots. so much so that the only way to fix it was to jump down to a #4 and buzz the top of my head to try and salvage the blending. i literally had to stop her and ask what she was doing and she was like what? nothing is wrong so i put my fingers (pointed towards my head) on each fade line and you could clearly see they were off by almost an inch and i was like ""dude, look at this"" her response was i am not a dude! i just kind of looked at her weird and said uhhh yeah i know that i just used dude as an expression. so she proceeds to buzz my head and at the end she was like i'm not going to make you pay for this and i said yeah, i wasn't planning on it. i still go back to the same supercuts but if she's working i will avoid her."

"good old tommy guns. i went in and asked for a mohawk, the barber asked me ""like david beckham?"" i replied ""no, like a punk, like something sid vicious might have"" she agreed and then gave me the david beckham, ""so like this?"" she asked. i was kinda choked because i had been growing my hair out for months and this was completely wrong and tried to say calmly ""no, nothing like this, you know what a mohawk is right?"" she apologised and said ""don't worry i can fix it"" alright i thought, then she shaved a diamond into the back of my head, when she showed me i lost it, i jumped up and said ""don't touch me!"" and walked out, i still have no idea what she was thinking."

4869	34674	86	bmlzqs	emys6bl	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	literally a few weeks ago, and my 30 year old ass cried. i did what i now know to be a mistake; went to an unfamiliar hair stylist to have my hair colored. i hadn't colored my light brown hair in a few years and wanted to add some dimension with highlights and lowlights. i pulled up a lot of reference photos, the hair stylist seemed to understand what i wanted, and she got to work. i should have realized something was wrong when she only put about 18 foils in my hair. i have pretty fine hair, but in the past stylists have used way more than 18 foils. unfortunately i had taken my glasses off for the appointment, so my vision was 80's level standard definition and i couldn't really see what was happening. when she finally started to dry my hair (i said i wanted some texture and she round-brushed it straight.) i put my glasses back on and saw stripes. blonde and red stripes in my ashy brown hair that started a quarter inch from my scalp. i would have been very on-trend in the late 1990's. amid my flashbacks to spice girls and butterfly hair clips, the stylists asked if i liked it and i just sat there agape like a catfish. she repeated the question and the other stylists and customers started side-eyeing me, and the intense focus mixed with my inability to lie caused me to start to break and the tears started. the head stylist swept over like a tall, beautiful superhero and pulled me to the back before i could make a scene. she looked over my hair and let me (quietly) get my frustrations out before insisting on fixing it. she put in more color, more depth, touched up the roots the last stylist left undyed, and styled it in textured waves. it looked much better, but still not really what i wanted. i'm trying to do it right this time by trying out other stylists for smaller things like trims and styles before deciding to color again. edit: grammar
4870	34674	159	bmlzqs	emyb9vp	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	not me, but i went with an army buddy for haircuts once and mine turned out fine. his was abysmal. his hair was so beyond repair after they spent over an hour trying to fix it, so they didn't make him pay. they should have paid him for the amount of shit he got for it later. i'm still surprised he didn't just have them buzz it all off.
4871	34674	61	bmlzqs	emyhv4y	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	about 2 years ago, i was looking for a new barber and decided to try out a shop near my work that's been around for years. small place that had a solid 4 stars on yelp. so i got my cut, gave it the okay (the lighting in there was low for the sake of ambience), and headed off to a soup kitchen where i volunteer. i then spent the whole afternoon getting the piss taken out of me by homeless dudes (and we're not talking light homeless dudes here, but super homeless folks who, as you can imagine, don't have great grooming regimens) for my messed up fade and the hairs sticking out of my head in random places. in a move that went against every grain of my conflict avoidant being, i called the shop up when my shift was over, explained that i wasn't happy with my cut, and asked them to make it right. they agreed. but when i went back, i had to sit in another barber's chair, explain to him point by point why i thought the cut was awful, and then i had to sit there as he fixed it while my original barber sat just feet away from me glowering. 10/10 would never do again.
4872	34674	206	bmlzqs	emyeomg	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	well my first mistake was going to a wal-mart salon. i had blonde hair half way down my back. i wanted a long a line cut and died a brownish auburn color. i guess one of the first red flags was she had me turned away from the mirror but i figured thats just how she needed me. ten minutes later this woman calls someone else ovet to finish it. uh okay? another little while later the new lady said she tried to fix it and spun me around. im freakin out because mistake? my hair is touching my jaw line and its purple!! i cried so hard and then they tried to charge me 70 dollars. i left and had to get it cut into a pixie.
4873	34674	112	bmlzqs	emy4ugv	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i didnt say i didnt like it. i was too afraid of the comb. i was probably 12 or 13, and the person who had cut my hair since i was little was changing careers, so i needed a new person to cut my hair. so the next time i need a haircut, my grandmother takes me to this shop near her house. the lady overall was fine. she seemed nice enough. i did notice some of the teeth of her comb were missing or broken, but i didnt think much of it. oh boy. when she started combing my hair, it was like she was trying to shove the comb through my skull. its not like i had tangled or unkempt hair, she apparently just thought proper combing technique included pushing the teeth of the comb against my head with all her might. she was making some comment about me having dandruff or something and that i needed to wash my hair more often while doing this, and when i finally flinched she said see? your scalp is tender. no, actually, youre using that thing like a weapon. when i got done, she had basically given me a bowl cut. she asked me if i was happy with the cut (i will give her that, she didnt do the thing some adults do when dealing with children and defer to the parents, ignoring the child completely), because youre the customer, what matters is if youre satisfied. i didnt particularly like it, but i didnt want her to use the comb on me again, so i said yes. and we never went back there again.

4875	34674	692	bmlzqs	emxu7vc	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	after hearing the customer in the barber's chair next to mine complain bitterly to his barber about the haircut he had just received, i made sure to compliment my barber. it was a genuine compliment, too, because he did a great job. the guy next to me was just trying to embarrass his barber in front of others, much like a mean-spirited customer in a restaurant that takes obvious pleasure in berating the waiter.

4877	34674	204	bmlzqs	emyduxn	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	this is on a related note, but i once told a stylist not to touch my hair. it was at a paul mitchell school. i've gone to the school here in the past many times, but i guess it's only been recently that they've just started letting student stylists in without any kind of skills, abilities, competence, or anything. i don't know why they would let them on the floor. i noticed this at toni and guy schools as well. i don't go to schools any longer to get my hair cut. now i'll just pay good money and leave a good tip at an actual salon. anyways, i digress. i came in for a haircut last year to the paul mitchell school. i'm a woman and have a really easy hairstyle, it's moderately short and not a lot of layers of anything. i requested for a stylist to just trim my hair so it would grow out evenly. a student senior stylist comes out to shake my hand and i notice that she barely speaks english. she seems uncertain, shaky, and like she doesn't have a clue about what she's doing. she then takes me back to get my hair washed. she doesn't wet my hair thoroughly and proceeds to shampoo my hair when it isn't even wet. we then get back to the floor, and she starts separating my hair out into sections. after stabbing me with the pins and pulling out my hair, i told her to stop and that i wasn't comfortable letting her cut my hair. i felt terrible, and this was the only time i ever did something like that. a class instructor gives me a hair trim, and it took him less than 5 minutes. i was out the door. i tipped the woman, anyways, but i realize now i just should have given it to the instructor. what a weird and awful experience. now i will easily pay $50+ for a good haircut, because that kind of mess just isn't worth it to me. sometimes there's really good student stylists, but i'd rather not take the gamble.

4879	34674	127	bmlzqs	emyst1x	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"finally, a chance for my story. even though i'm late and no one will read it. this was about 20 years ago. i was visiting baltimore for a month, staying about 45 minutes outside of town in pikeville. i needed a hair cut, so found sam's barbershop in the phone book within walking distance, advertising $5 haircuts (first red flag). i went there, and it was downstairs in anything hair salon (2nd red flag). i found it downstairs, and there was no one else there (final red flag). sam was older, but nice, so i sat down and he started cutting and talking. he proceeded to tell me about his life, including how he emigrated from poland as an adult to avoid hitler. i did some quick mental math, figuring out he had to be (at the youngest) in his very late 80's. i also began to notice he had to hold himself steady with one hand, while cutting with only one hand. this meant he couldn't pull the hair up or anything between his fingers, he could just hack away with scissors. i tried to mentally signal my wife to pull the fire alarm, but she just read her magazine. i then just resigned myself to my fate, and listened to his story. to quote bill from king of the hill, ""it's only hair. it'll grow back."" he finally finished. he didn't ask what i thought, but i said thanks, and gave him $5, plus a $2 tip, which by his reaction was the first tip he'd gotten in about 40 years. i drove straight to the next barbershop i saw, and when i walked in the barber's eyes got really wide for a second until he could regain his composure. i said ""it's a little uneven, to which he replied you think?"". i asked him to do what he could, so he cut it down to about 1/4 inch on the sides, and about 1/2 inch on top. cost me another $20, but at least it was even. all in all, an interesting day. i was out of town, and enjoyed the low maintenance cut. if my head weren't so lumpy and irregular, i might have kept it. plus, it was quite a treat to hear a first hand account of someone evading hitler. 8/10, would do it again. and it did, in fact, grow back."
4880	34674	193	bmlzqs	emycc1f	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i went to ulta (yes, a place you would expect them to listen to what you want) and got a different lady than normally. now i have curly hair, and i know that an inch and a half off on straight hair is different than on curly hair. so i told her i wanted an inch and a half off, so she was so so persistent on me getting layers (i will never do layers, they're terrible on me) and i was like, no i didn't like it and she said that once you get old you will want layers and i'm just like uh ya. sure. and so when she was done cutting, my hair already dry and product in it, she literally said she only cut an inch off. she also said that whenever someone asks for a certain length, always do half an inch less than what they asked for. she blatantly told me that she doesnt do exactly what they want. and the bill was 50 bucks and she still doesn't do the length i want
4881	34674	38	bmlzqs	emyauwl	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i once had a barber cut my hair with some sort of industrial flowbee. steve the barber in his overalls certainly did disappoint. it was by far the worst attempt at a haircut i've ever received. &#x200b; he did the standard how does it look. i pointed out that it was all lopsided. steve soldiered on and tried to fix it. this somehow made it worse and now much shorter. he asked again. i said no it looks even worse, and told him to stop cutting it. he told me i wouldn't be charged if i wasn't happy. i said something along the lines of i wouldn't have paid for this if you did. i then had to go get it cut somewhere else and still looked stupid since i look awful with short hair. &#x200b; the moral of the story is don't budget shop for haircuts. find someone capable and tip them so much that they remember you when you come in and want to make sure you come back. the only problem is that if they ever leave it's absolutely terrible.
4882	34674	115	bmlzqs	emycqru	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked her to shorten my hair from half-way down my back to a shoulder length bob cut. she was a little too excited about it and i thought she was just being nice. she gave me a pixie cut. the haircut she had. i should have said no but i felt too bad to do it. i know it wasnt my fault because i asked her twice if she could leave it a little below my shoulders since it would curl back up higher. my curly hair went from being manageable to the curls being too short to even pin back in some areas.

4885	34674	36	bmlzqs	emyhuor	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	every haircut to me is like being on a makeover show since i can't see much without my glasses. so when she asks me if i like it i put on my glasses and take it all in at once. i made an involuntary and unflattering noise first then just responded with a no. she looked like i just killed her kitten. her two nearby coworkers immediately turned into awkward seals and i got the impression this wasn't the first time this has happened. she started to say something and i just put my hand up. i then went to the counter, paid, and went home. my so fixed it best she could. i waited a couple weeks and then got an early haircut fix the issues.
4886	34674	33	bmlzqs	emynhwe	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	it was two weeks before my wedding. i just wanted a quick trim. my wedding was in the midwest and i live in california, and i had to do bridey stuff in town before i could meet with her. i figured id get a small clean up before flying out. i had a stylist set up in the midwest but my hair was stupid overgrown. the salon called and said the stylist called in sick, but they had another that could do it. i go, show her the picture. bangs are eyebrow level and layered in the photo. ive used it a bunch of times as my default bangs photo. in one fell swoop, she completely cut my bangs off. i looked like fucking julius caesar. except worse. because the bangs were cut like _-_ across my forehead. completely uneven. cue immediate tears. i start shaking my head and looking between the photos and my face. ive never had someone immediately cut my bangs off like that. its usually a gradual process - but nope. this lady just went chomp and they were gone. they comped the cut. but, i had also scheduled an eyebrow appt since they were also overgrown. except - nobody was available to do my eyebrows. so i was left with the shittiest haircut ive ever had, paired with overgrown eyebrows, and a puffy crying face. thank fuck for my stylist back home. she told me to take biotin twice a day, and managed to clean up the cut so i looked nice. its not what i wanted for my wedding hair originally, but lesson learned i guess.

"sort of related: for my girlfriend's senior prom (i had graduated the year before) i was going to straighten my hair with one of those chemical kits. i have rather wavy and hard to fight hair, especially for a white guy. so i picked up some chemical solution called ""africa's finest"" or something and had my mom handle it for me. well it took longer to apply than we expected. it smelled like kerosene and acetone. my head started tingling after the 15 minute recommended time. so i washed it out and the area around my scalp was bright red. and the next day was the prom. so i went to bed with my newly straightened hair. and i woke up with the whole side of my head matted. the chemical actually burned through my scalp and it started healing over the hair. that was fun to pull out. and some of the tips fused together to boot. it looked alright though. but my mom felt pretty bad about going all trench warfare on my skull"

""i guess you'd have to take it all down to the same level, huh?"" i say. the dude panics, turns to the woman next to him, who just gives us the *what the fuck happened* look and shoos him off of me. she studies it for a while and basically says that she'll try and salvage it as best she can, but it's going to be pretty different. after a few minutes, it looks a bit like [gary oldman](https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/system/images/photo_albums/gary-oldman/large/14-oldman-thefifthelement.jpg?1384968217) in the 5th element mixed with [macklemore](https://www.respectmyregion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/macklemore.jpg). she swears that it's up and coming as a professional look, and i just sort of side eye her and sigh and say ""let's just take the rest of it off. we tried."" i get the shortest buzz cut i've ever had in my life, but hey, it ended up being free. &#x200b; anyway, i meet up with my friends for a drink; all the guys had a massive laugh at my expense, all the girls were horrified for me, my girlfriend was caught somewhere in between. and she became my fiancee a month later, when my hair grew back in."

"i didn't say ""no"" directly to the girl that cut my hair, because that would be super awkward for me to do, and i didn't really notice how bad it was until i got home and looked in the mirror. i did notice eventually though, so i decided to go back the next day, hoping that the girl that had cut my hair wouldn't be there. i walked in and didn't immediately notice anyone that looked like her, so i figured i was all good. when asked if i was there for a haircut, i said no, that i'd just need a quick fix. when the girl looked closer at my hair, she said, out loud, ""oh yeah this looks awful, let me fix that for you"" and walked me over to her station. it was at that point that i remembered the girl who had cut my hair the previous day had mentioned that she herself was getting a pretty drastic haircut that night, and to my horror, she was cutting hair at the station *directly* next to me then. i just hadn't noticed her before because she had a different haircut. so there i was, wanting to melt into the seat as the girl fixing my hair is making comments out loud about how bad it was, asking where i'd gotten it cut, etc. and all the while the culprit was standing 5 feet away. i didn't think it could get any worse, but when it was all finished she walked me up to the counter, and needed the manager to come over to comp my haircut and find my receipt from the previous day. unfortunately, the other girl finished her haircut shortly after mine, so she had to awkwardly stand there as the manager looked up my previous days check, which i'm sure had her name on it, while she was waiting to cash someone out. i wanted to die."
4894	34674	24	bmlzqs	emyri9c	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i went to this salon in birmingham, alabama. it would be the first haircut i had gotten in that city. i did some research before hand and they were highly rated, also they gave you a glass of wine or a beer for free so i made an appointment with a random hair stylist (im male in case this is important). anyway, i check in, get a cheap ass beer (no complaints there) and take a seat for my haircut. this lady didnt use buzzers which i was used to, my old hair stylist would only use scissors and was kind of proud of the fact. he just always gave me a stellar haircut. well she just grabbed a chunk of hair between her index and thumb, cut if off and tossed it aside. she wasnt grabbing it between her index finder and middle finger like i was used to but hey, different stylist, different haircut. she did this for about 3 min and i was sweating balls. eventually it just became patchy and looked awful. like the cynthia doll from rugrats. asked her to stop, rinse me out and just call it. i went home and had to buzz my hair. left a brutal review and the owner contacted me. he felt awful and was sincere. demanded that i accept a refund. i changed my review after he contacted me and gave me a refund but i never went back.

4896	34674	20	bmlzqs	emyijdj	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a kid i always wanted long hair, but the woman my mom took me to always insisted that i didn't need long hair and she would cut off way more than i wanted. i cried every time and she would always tell me that since it was still long enough to put in a ponytail (barely) it was long enough for me. i started refusing to get hair cuts and just trimming it by myself. i'm in my thirties now, i have hair down to my lower back, and still cut it myself.

"got a haircut today, actually. same salon as i normally go to, new person. i wanted the side of my head buzzed how i normally do it, but it had been growing out for about six months (i've been busy) and looked more like a bob than it usually does. she trimmed it kinda short and asked me if that was okay. i said no. trimmed it a little shorter around the ear and asked if i like that. i said ""get out the clippers, put on the number 3 head, and shave the side of my head."""

"i went in to get my haircut at my barbershop. there was a new guy working, so i decided to be kind and give him a shot. instead of listening when i said ""just take two inches"" he decided i said ""use attachment 2."" i sat down, he started with one big strip and i knew he'd messed up. i sat through the whole thing because what could i do at that point? he gets done and says ""how's that?"" i said ""not even remotely what i asked for."" he got pissy with me, so i turned to his boss, who was a few chairs over. when his boss turned to look at me, he blurted out ""what in the hell happened?"" the new barber tried to argue with me again, and i asked his boss if i had ever gotten my hair cut that way. his boss said never, and told me not to pay. i left, and the next time i went by, the chair was empty."

4902	34674	35	bmlzqs	emydltq	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i once asked my barber to cut the sides of my hair and he gave me the most ugliest 80s high top i've ever seen and i cried when i got home because i spent so long texturizing my hair to make it not an afro and he put me back to square one.

4905	34674	17	bmlzqs	emz5s11	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i used to work at super cuts and this young kid (late teens, early twenties) would come in every so often and quietly get his hair cut then quietly say he didn't like it and leave without paying (which was the guarantee if you didn't like the cut). after a few times he finally started paying. i asked why he suddenly started liking the haircut and he confessed he was out of work, lying about not liking the cut so he could get it for free so he could look presentable as he searched for a job. i don't blame him.
4906	34674	18	bmlzqs	emygeyl	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"short version: i said no once and it wasn't much better but i had lost faith in that barber so accepted it but gave a bad review. the owner contacted me and wanted to make it right. she cut it and it was better, went back a few times but for a $40ish haircut i really should have been happier than ""okay"". eventually found a better barber for $15. more details: i'm a guy, and i used to be in the military so i transitioned from super short hair to a still conservative but longer fade. my hair is short on the sides and long enough on the top to be messy, disheveled, get bed-hair and hat hair. it's a very simple haircut, i thought. so this place that charged around $40 for a haircut seems nice. they give you a cocktail and there's old-timey magazines (a stray playboy) and wood everywhere. this guy cuts my hair and it is absolute shit. it's not balanced, my bangs are crooked, i'm not happy. i ask him specifically to balance out over here, straighten this over there, i specifically tell him where i want fixed and what would look better. again, this is still pretty short hair in the scheme of hair. guy barely improves it at all. but clearly he's hopeless because i gave him explicit feedback, so my trust is gone. i say it's fine and i pay and leave, leave a bad review on google. owner reaches out. she does a much better job, but awkwardly not as good as i expected for as simple as my haircut is. because i liked the pampering and she was nice and helped me out in good faith, i went back a few times, but was open to new places. eventually talked to someone who had good hair, and found a place that was way cheaper and got consistent results. my barber rocks, it's only $15 and takes maybe 15 minutes to cut my hair. surprised it took that long to find."
4907	34674	17	bmlzqs	emygpan	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	was out with my dad one day and he was going to get his haircut. it wasn't at my usual place but i needed one anyway so i decided to get mine cut. i asked for an inch left to be on top all around. a tad shorter on the sides though. &#x200b; i. had. less. than. a. quarter. inch. left. not even long enough to grab with my fingers. &#x200b; pissed me off. lady didn't listen at all. what's worse is that i am blind without my glasses so i couldn't see mid cut how it looked. it grew back but i still get anxiety every time i sit in a barber's chair.
4908	34674	18	bmlzqs	emyh5ua	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i was 11 and i just had my hair trimmed about an inch or so which was okay. i had my hair red and i wanted it back to my natural chocolate brown hair. stylist gave me black hair. like goth black. i didnt even say i didnt like it i just started bawling my eyes out and ran out of the store
4909	34674	17	bmlzqs	emyhsct	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked for a cut brushing my shoulders, no layers, a lob you might call it. what i ended up with was a can i speak to the manager haircut and i couldnt hold in my distraught over it. i would consider myself a usually super laid back and easy customer, not a complainer, but that just was.awful. i had even showed him a picture of exactly what i wanted. like i said, im not very confrontational and struggle to assert myself sometimes - when i said that it wasnt what i had asked for, he got very defensive and angry with me, and i decided it wasnt worth the hassle of demanding a refund. hair grows back. but thats the last time i buy a haircut voucher on groupon. (yes, im aware that i shouldve never done that. live and ya learn)

"i went to beauty school to learn to be a hair dresser. aaaaaand yeah. i basically gave my own friend the worst cut ever. she wanted a bob, and i got the back looking good and fine, but i couldn't get the sides to match the length at the back. she ended up with a semi circle cut out of the back and longer sides. my friend was being kind god love her, she said she liked it, and i knew she was lying because i knew i was doing something wrong, and i kept looking around for my tutor, and when she came over she was like 'wtf'? i was so embarrassed, and i immediately choked up, and she realised that she was kinda dressing me down in front of everyone, so she was like ""it's ok, its ok, i'll help you fix it."" a few snips later, it was looking great, but it completely knocked my confidence, i was doing really well up until that point and i dropped out lol."

4914	34674	29	bmlzqs	emycuhb	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	im a simple guy who has a 2 (6mm) at the sides and just cut ontop, i went to a new guy at my usual barbers and said what i wanted. when i was finished i could kinda tell it wasnt even ontop so i shuffled my hair and laid it flat against my forhead, the left side of my fringe was an inch lower then the right and i simple said it wasnt what i wanted and could he even it out. &#x200b; he said he thought that was how i had it, and went on to even my hair cut out. &#x200b; was a bit awkward when the next time in he did the same thing so i told him and his manager was giving him shit so i had to tell him to calm down it was my fault for not being clear. was kinda awkward as the barbers was really busy and his manager is an asshole anyway. &#x200b; regarding his manager he is a 40 something little fat thing who thinks hes hot shit, ive been in there before when its quiet and he talks like he knows everything. hes such an annoying ass but the hairdressers are always nice guys- i can tell some stories about him if anyone cares :)
