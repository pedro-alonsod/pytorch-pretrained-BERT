1691	48707	7929	bn3ab7	en2fw5w	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	a lot of religious music is absolutely, hauntingly beautiful. i will gladly sing along even though i don't believe in god.
1692	48707	5503	bn3ab7	en1zyyn	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as a christian, i admire atheists' need for logical explanation.
1693	48707	8855	bn3ab7	en1ynt8	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as an atheist i admire the passion and effort that went into the great religious buildings of the world.
1694	48707	5018	bn3ab7	en1xrux	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"i appreciate atheists' willingness to ask questions and work through the things that challenge them about faith. i'm a believer so obviously we don't come to the same conclusions, but i think too many of my brothers and sisters bury the stuff about their faith that they struggle with. that can both hurt their walk and make them come off as sanctimonious. i say that because that was me, once upon a time. some days, it still is. it's a work in progress. matthew 7:7 says ""ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."" too often believers don't want to ask tough questions, but i think it's important to do so. if the christian god is who he claims to be, i have to imagine he can handle honest questions from someone seeking to understand."
1695	48707	2808	bn3ab7	en29kjy	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	christian here. i really admire the fact that many athiests try to do good things for the community (like service projects, volunteerism, fundraisers) because they truly care and want to be a good person all on there own. to clarify further, many christians are also like this, but i feel a good majority are like this because their church told them they should do it because it pleases god, or they want to go to heaven, or their small group was doing it and they want to fit in. granted some athiests do good things to pat themselves on their back via social media, but many others do it because they feel its the right thing to do snd aren't trying to benefit themselves in some way. thats the sign of a truly good person.
1696	48707	588	bn3ab7	en1xbty	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	funeral rites. some religions have elaborate death/ funeral rites that last for about a month, followed by a prayer to mark the first year of death. close family, as well as members of the community are required to attend these. this results in a situation where the grieving family is constantly surrounded for at least a month before they can resume their normal life. i personally would rather have something like this, than have 1 memorial service and then be immediately be left alone.
1697	48707	53865	bn3ab7	en20ekw	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	religious temples, no matter the religion, are often incredibly beautiful works of art.
1698	48707	17265	bn3ab7	en2ee60	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	im atheist and my grandma was extremely religious. my uncle (her son) died a few years ago and it about killed her. she ended up getting diagnosed with leukemia and given a slim chance to survive. she was 100% fine with it because in her mind she was going to see her son and sisters in heaven. i wish i could have that
1699	48707	27763	bn3ab7	en1v93g	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	the arts resulting from religion.

1701	48707	14494	bn3ab7	en20769	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as an atheist, i admire that religion can provide a source of strength, community, and hope for people. through religion, people find the courage and hope to continue a mundane or excessively taxing existence. people also develop life-long friendships and support communities through church groups and other religious organizations. i believe these aspects are important to have in one's life. if religion can provide that for some people, then i think that's a great thing. edit: thanks for the coins you wonderful people. whether youre religious or atheist, i hope you all have a wonderful day.
1702	48707	28617	bn3ab7	en2379b	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	im atheist. i admire their sense of community
1703	48707	10709	bn3ab7	en1vz63	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	atheist here. i really adore seeing the community around religious groups. support and love for one another makes me a little less pessimistic about the church(es)
1704	48707	10271	bn3ab7	en20sgj	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as a christian, i admire athiests for their self control. we twist our own laws and word, *from god*, too much.
1705	48707	16407	bn3ab7	en1wwm1	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	atheists seem to care about animals a lot.

1707	48707	3938	bn3ab7	en1ycws	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as a religious person on reddit, i admire that most atheists i know don't push their atheism on me the same way i respectfully don't push religion on them.
1708	48707	29891	bn3ab7	en26047	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"as a christian, i admire that atheists do the good things just for the sake of doing good things. there is no thought of a reward coming in the afterlife of the fear of eternal punishment for not doing them. i had another christian say to me once ""what would be point obeying the commandments if heaven and hell aren't real?"" (not my beliefs, but it is for many.) edit: i just joined reddit and this was one of my first times posting. i'm not even sure how reddit works, i'm still learning. i'm deeply honored by the gold and silver - thank you all so much. <3"
1709	48707	6110	bn3ab7	en23bh2	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i came in here expecting a bunch of backhanded thinly-veiled insults. i'm pleasantly surprised (although there are still a few of those.) &#x200b; as for me, i'm a religious person. thing i admire most in atheists is the fortitude it can take to say what they believe (or don't believe) and to stick to what they believe even when many around them may disagree or even subject them to scorn. i've haven't known many atheists to pull any punches or to act like they think differently than they do. in my view, they tend to live their beliefs more openly and courageously than a lot of religious people do. that's an attribute that i myself could do a lot better at.
1710	48707	14378	bn3ab7	en233yg	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"i am a christian. i admire how atheists don't judge others based on their sins. that is certainly something us christians can do better at. not having a ""holier than thou"" attitude."
1711	48707	7972	bn3ab7	en25zem	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	wholesome thread. this is exactly what we needed tbh.
1712	48707	631	bn3ab7	en1vy0e	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i really enjoy the community that religion builds, wish more people could enjoy that sense of belonging
1713	48707	618	bn3ab7	en2cqmm	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	the raw rationale of atheists is quite impressive. i once had an atheist professor who literally came up with logical ways for certain religions and their claims to be correct while still being grounded in reason. it was mind blowing.
1714	48707	704	bn3ab7	en20bwg	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	atheist here. the sheer community around religion is pretty cool. my gf and her family are very religious though. one of the old ladies at her church was dying, had at most a week to live, and one of her last requests was for my gfs brother to come sing to her one last time in the hospital. she loved his voice from the choir. he came, she ultimately fell asleep, and died as he was still singing.
1715	48707	288	bn3ab7	en35s2h	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i don't know if this has already been stated but this is something to admire about atheists. >[why did god create atheists?](https://randysrandom.com/god-create-atheists/) there is a famous story told in chassidic literature that addresses this very question. the master teaches the student that god created everything in the world to be appreciated, since everything is here to teach us a lesson. one clever student asks what lesson can we learn from atheists? why did god create them? the master responds god created atheists to teach us the most important lesson of them all  the lesson of true compassion. you see, when an atheist performs an act of charity, visits someone who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is not doing so because of some religious teaching. he does not believe that god commanded him to perform this act. in fact, he does not believe in god at all, so his acts are based on an inner sense of morality. and look at the kindness he can bestow upon others simply because he feels it to be right. this means, the master continued that when someone reaches out to you for help, you should never say i pray that god will help you. instead for the moment, you should become an atheist, imagine that there is no god who can help, and say i will help you. martin buber, tales of hasidim vol. 2 (1991)
1716	48707	1105	bn3ab7	en2hvpz	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	forgiveness. i seen a video of a family that has son killed and it's tear jerking. all they speak about how the guy went wrong somewhere in life and they hoped he found redemption etc.
1717	48707	202	bn3ab7	en38pqq	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	muslim here. admire how atheists are simply living their lives. no fear of anything. also, all the atheists that i've met are good people and when i mean good i mean charitable and genuine loving people. they do good for the purpose of good. i try as much as possible to emulate that.
1718	48707	3384	bn3ab7	en27br0	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"it's a little difficult to explain and i am sure people on both sides will roll their eyes at me.but prayer. just not in the way most people think of prayer. hear me out. when someone you love is going through a hard time, sometimes there is literally nothing you can do. some problems can't be helped by outside people. for whatever reason. that happens. and it really fucking sucks. it really fucking sucks watching someone you care about suffer. at the same time, it really fucking sucks watching your loved ones worry about *you* if you're the one who is suffering and can't be helped. i hate it so fucking much watching someone i care about struggle and i can't do shit. i hate it so much when someone i care about wants to help me and they can't. i worry about them and feel like shit i can't do anything. or i am having to watch them worry about me since there isn't anything they can do. the phrase, ""sending my love."" or ""sending warm thoughts your way."" accomplishes so little. but sometimes when you feel so helpless that's all you can say. that's all you can do. and then come in religious people who have ""the power of prayer."" even though as an atheist.i feel that ""sending you my love."" accomplishes the same thing as ""you're in my prayers."" i'm still a little jealous of that ability.of ""prayer."" when someone i care about genuinely says, ""i'll pray for you."" to me.i do get some comfort. yeah, i don't think it will solve my problems.but i believe *they believe* that it will. the person i care about will worry about me a little less. and i take comfort in that. i do also feel loved when someone says, ""i'm sending you warm thoughts."" to me, but having been in that position myself.i worry that they will be worrying over me. and there have been many times where someone i care about is religious and i wish i could say, ""i'll pray for you."" because i know that would mean a lot to them. i know they would get some comfort for that. but as an atheist.it would be a lie for me to say it. and then the words, ""i'm sending you warm thoughts."" feels so empty in comparison. i hope that makes sense. and obviously i mean it on an individual level. certainly not to a community tragedy. yeah. i don't think prayer actually solves a problem, but i can recognize the comfort it gives some people and sometimes i wish i could provide that too in times where there isn't anything else."
1719	48707	272	bn3ab7	en208p6	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i am atheist and i really enjoy some sacred music. it makes me feel good to hear people singing their hearts out about something they really believe. example: ride the mighty high by the mighty clouds of joy, morning has broken by cat stevens, and celine dions version of oh holy night. i dont believe it but i appreciate their passion
1720	48707	486	bn3ab7	en24d80	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i like how passionately many of the actively religious people speak of their faith. i ran into a guy so empowered by the sermon he experienced he gave everyone in the burger king i was in a hug and told them they were loved. seeing people be happy with whatever they're doing brings me a lot of joy and i find it super adorable. plus, having been at low points i'm aware of how much those words alone can bring somebody out of a funk. i also love the good many churches do. my old neighbourhood made sure everyone, even those who were not interested in jesus, had what they needed and made an effort to help people out where it was needed without judgement. i volunteered with them a couple times as an (open) atheist and they were just so welcoming. i know many, if not most, are like this and i wish it got the attention the negative often gets.
1721	48707	484	bn3ab7	en2fk21	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	religious person here. i feel like atheism has propelled science forward, and science has supplied me with medication i need to survive.

1723	48707	91	bn3ab7	en2lah1	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	atheist here. once a woman talked about how her life was in shambles, depressed, broke, doing drugs, fully convinced that absolute no one loved her. until she realized that there was one person that loved her. jesus. that hope that someone still loved here was her only motive to keep on living. she talked about how she turned her life around because of that hope. i decided to keep quiet. didnt matter whether god is real or not, her story was beautiful.
1724	48707	1195	bn3ab7	en1z41f	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	religious people seem very confident and sure about their beliefs. i have had to succumb to a life of  i dont know sometimes this can feel heavy.
1725	48707	336	bn3ab7	en2gisc	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i just want to say this thread is way more wholesome and civil than i thought it would be. good job both religious folks and atheists!
1726	48707	207	bn3ab7	en2i738	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"i admire the ease at which they can find comfort after a loved one dies. they get to think, "" they're in this wonderful place now and i'll get to see them again after i die, and then we'll be together forever."" we're just like, ""well that fuckin sucks."""
1727	48707	64	bn3ab7	en24u4r	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"community. i'm essentially an atheist (ignostic really, but that's not a term people use), but i really admire the sense of community that religions offer. i think so many people in the us are lonely, and religion is a great way for people to have an ""extended community"" of people who have something in common. i love the religions that offer some kind of support system for people who need help (medical bills, losing jobs). i love that you often get to know people in your neighborhood who you might see on other days. it's really hard for an atheist to have the same thing. you can do meetups, but most aren't held on a weekly schedule if they're consistent at all. and you rarely meet people nearby. the lack of extended community is, imo, one of the reasons companies are able to harness that need and turn it into work. i despise companies that talk about being a family (that you lose when fired), and i'm cynical about team-building exercises and companies where everyone hangs out with each other on weekends. it leads to nasty cliques, people taking work too seriously, and people working hard because their whole life centers around it. silicon valley is full of companies taking advantage of people's need for interaction to place themselves at the center, but it benefits the company and builds a really fragile community. i work from home now and i'm really struggling to find this. everyone just goes home and disappears into their garages, and it's hard to find new friends and new communities at this age (mid 30s) while everyone is busy with work and kids. i've been to countries where everyone comes out at night, has a little bbq, and talks to each other. they walk around and play games with neighbors or just say hi. i really wish everyone did that here. i really wish our sense of community wasn't tied to religion, because i don't think it should have to be, and i really wish the american community wasn't a thing of the past."
1728	48707	64	bn3ab7	en2suyq	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	this is my favourite thread to read in a long time. what a great way to generate discourse in this way. you could have phrased it in a dozen different ways but look at the great responses youre getting. kudos to the op.
1729	48707	62	bn3ab7	en36b4g	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	religious person here. in fact, clergy person here. i find that the atheists i've talked to have thought long and hard about god and ethics. they make moral choices for their own sake, not from fear of punishment or anticipation of reward. that's what i admire. i do find that atheists tend to lump believers together. and to overestimate reward/punishment/afterlife as what drives believers. may i say that i find online atheists are less thoughtful than the ones i've talked to in person. but not in this thread.
1730	48707	455	bn3ab7	en1vqw6	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as an athiest i admire hope.

1742	48707	335	bn3ab7	en2ahp9	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	the internet atheists who go around bashing people and their beliefs like they're on their own personal crusade to proselytize the planet, they're a vocal minority. most atheists in real life are intelligent, respectful people who simply require proof before believing in something. they have no agenda, no zealotry. they haven't made a religion out of their atheism. they simply don't believe god exists. if you do, whatever. good for you.
1743	48707	637	bn3ab7	en1vfz9	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as an atheist i admire the discipline of strongly religious people to go to church every week. that takes a great deal of mental fortitude to wake up that early to hear a person drone on for about an hour.

1745	48707	74	bn3ab7	en2jmwr	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	ok, i'm religious, but not overly so. one thing i admire about atheists is the fact that i can express thoughts and beliefs i hold without having to feel guilty or like i'm letting that person down. i can be myself the most around atheists, funnily enough.
1746	48707	165	bn3ab7	en2dvyf	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i'm an atheist, and i admire the lack of fear of dying due to believing in the afterlife and if they are a good/non-sinning theist. in general atheists have a greater fear of dying as we do not believe in life after death and that this life is our only life. edit: i have gotten this view from chatsworth of a atheists and they sometimes feel the same way. now my theory of death isn't paralyzing as it is actually more abilitating as it gives me the feeling of wanting to live my life to the fullest whilst other people my age just play video games i like to go explore the countryside and work on the local farm.
1747	48707	54	bn3ab7	en2498g	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	the comfort they find in their god. must be nice.

1749	48707	26	bn3ab7	en37pbb	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	when my family and i weren't in a good place financially the local church came through and helped us out by giving us food and presents on christmas. they knew that my family and i were not religious so they never asked about it. probably the best people i've ever met were in that church
1750	48707	165	bn3ab7	en2eh2a	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i am atheist, but my friend once said. many atheists actually know a lot about religion. they then use what they learned to make their judgement. he was right, in my case.

1752	48707	156	bn3ab7	en1zv0e	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i'm a christian, and i admire atheists' skepticism. it's good to be wary of bullshit, because there's a lot of it out there. i also admire logical thinking, although i can't credit all atheists with that. only maybe half the atheists i've known have been truly logical thinkers. but as a philosophy, atheism has logic baked in.

1755	48707	22	bn3ab7	en3b0tf	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i grew out of islam in college, but i really admired the shared narrative and power of the ummah. islam is big on collective action and community. the ummah, or the community surround themselves with many principles based on kindness, charity and love of your fellow man. when i was deeply in the faith - it felt like i could ask for anything. we addressed each other as brothers and sisters. are you traveling? reach out to a local mosque they'll let you stay at their facility or find a community member that can find you a bed. need money, or are you sick? the mosque could allow you to present your case to the community during prayer. there one could ask for prayer or donations. daycare? therapist? food? go to the mosque. &#x200b; there was also the call to action. you were often encouraged to donate to the poor, volunteer or just be a good person. the community would self police negative behaviors, or intervene in family conflicts. it really was beautiful. but the thing i miss the most - the routines. lunch time prayer and evening prayer we go to the mosque. friday prayer meet at the mosque. ramadan, spend all night at the mosques praying. i can't accept the existence of an abrahamic god for reasons that wouldn't be productive to explain, or haven't been said before. that lack of faith makes attempts at participating in the community feel disingenuous. i'd feel like i'm tainting something pure by faking it. i really admire this though. this raise to a call and devote faith in something. the camaraderie around something bigger than yourself.
1756	48707	22	bn3ab7	en3bodv	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	my nephew died. we immediately threw the dog into a car and spent the next few days with my b&sil. i loved him and my world was shattered, albeit nothing compared to what his parents felt. as they vacillated through the different faces of grief, they could either blame god for taking him or be glad he was with him. i'm glad they could have that. for me, it will never be anything but a pointless act that destroyed something meaningful. this was six months ago. i still can't go a day without thinking of something i wish i could say to him. if i could pray, i would. i know he would be able to hear me if i lived that different life. i tell a chest of ash that i love it everytime i see it and it hurts exponentially more because i know he's not in there.
1757	48707	22	bn3ab7	en37lx1	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as a muslim, i admire how atheists dont fight about who is the right god and that their judgement on people is more personal or objective that religious people.

1765	48707	16	bn3ab7	en25irl	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	there are a few things i admire about religion. first and foremost is the fellowship between members of a congregation. that's a thing i think people miss the most about quitting their church. often they will try something like unitarian universalists to try to recapture that. secondly, i think religious devotion has inspired some of the greatest art and architecture the world has ever seen. when i think of the world's most beautiful buildings, i think of places like notre dame, the blue mosque, the sistine chapel, angor wat, the white temple, or the simple unadorned but iconic white protestant country church with it's simple steeple. then there is the art like the last supper, the ceiling in the sistine chapel, the sculpture of christ the redeemer in rio. finally, i think religion, when at its best, encourages people to act selflessly. to donate to help strangers in need, to send food, clothing or money to those in need. one doesn't need religion to act selflessly. or morally. but if that encouragement is there, i think it's a good thing.
1766	48707	15	bn3ab7	en30wbj	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i'm a christian and i truly admire some atheists for their simple and effective moral codes. they do the right thing just because it *feels* right to them, not because theyr'e afraid of god's wrath. i think religious people can learn from that

1768	48707	13	bn3ab7	en3964l	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"so my cat died a few days ago. she'd been part of my life for 17 years; almost half my life. my best friend got a dog around the same time i got my cat, but his dog died about two years ago. this dog and cat had spent the first half of their lives living together as my friend and i were roommates. we were best pals and so were our pets. i stayed up all night with my cat and then stood by her the last morning as she passed on. my first thought after she died was: ""at least she gets to go meet my friend's dog. they can cuddle and play together again."" i'm an atheist. i don't believe in an afterlife. yet that thought, that moment, that story.it gave me so much peace it's unreal. i want to believe."
1769	48707	30	bn3ab7	en2j1qj	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	regarding atheists, i would say this. while some people are dogmatic about it many are not. as an example, i am an american convert to hinduism. i have a friend who is actually somewhat prominent in atheist circles. during some difficult times, he has encouraged me in my faith in that he has seen the changes it has made in me, and seen the seriousness of my commitment. while he doesn't believe in my faith, he believes in my dedication. in fact, he more than once, during my time as a monk, made donations to help me go on pilgrimages to see my guru. many atheist i have known are like that. i have even found, provided you don't preach, you can share aspects of the philosophy and be heard and appreciated.
