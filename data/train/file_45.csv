"not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the us in the depression. it was called the civilian conservation corps. participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country. the reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the dust bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the us was not a bottomless well of natural resources. (erosion was a big cause of the dust bowl, and the dust bowl was a factor in the depression, so it all tied together.) they were also called ""roosevelt's tree army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control. in my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture. you can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive. (i'm actually going to stay in one next week.) some of them have photos from the ccc days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on. i'd definitely support a program like that today, but i think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it. plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated. with the ccc, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out. it would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start. edit: a number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins i mentioned. the ones i'm familiar with are in pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/. not all cabins are ccc-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details. (there's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about ccc's role in the park.) rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a pennsylvania resident. the system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly. some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ada-accessible unit. other states and some national parks also have ccc-built cabins available for rental, but as far as i know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are."

21	80513	69	bn3bpz	en249xr	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, because i don't think transporting millions of young people out of cities, towns and rural areas to these destinations and forcing them to work will be helpful. i get that they need to be made conscious of environmental issues, but i just don't think it would be effective (as in actually helping to get the work done). they could only do work that they wouldn't need a qualification or any special skills for, it would be a massive safety issue (making sure they don't drown cleaning the ocean or get injured planting trees) and it would cost massive amounts of money to pay, house and feed them all. i generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. it would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects.

23	80513	58	bn3bpz	en24uz5	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	maybe it's because here military service is not mandatory so i didn't grew up with that mentality, but i don't think that kind of service should be mandatory. there are some projects where prisioners kind of do that, but, while it would help, i think in the long run it would be better for people to do it voluntarily
24	80513	201	bn3bpz	en21li3	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, because that assumes that the state has a natural right to my free labor and time. that shit is for communist countries, not us.

"""do this work or get punished"". y'know, i think the 13th amendment says something about that."
26	80513	40	bn3bpz	en2h4sq	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	the mandatory part is the problem. i would, however, support the use of on duty military in those projects since that's the actual existential threat.
27	80513	21	bn3bpz	en2webk	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	this would be much more fitting as an alternative to regular incarceration. in the us we need a complete rework of prison systems anyway. making prisoners accountable and functioning parts of society while serving time has great rehabilitation potential. also, giving them minimum wage for commissary, savings, and their family on the outside would be great too.

29	80513	21	bn3bpz	en2b9yk	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	it seems like a good idea but it really isn't. we should care more about the environment but mandatory service would be very inconvenient. at this age we are dealing with stress after stress after stress, i would not want to have to put everything on hold for mandatory environmental service. while it's for a good cause, people might start to resent it and not want anything to do with the environment after. idk, just my opinion. there should be another way to get people to care more about the environment, but this shouldn't be it.

"there is gonna be a mandatory in the same fashion in france soon for 16 year olds, its called ""civil service"" and it consists in working for society which of course includes environmental matters."

62	80513	3	bn3bpz	en32rhx	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	absolutely not. offer the program with some nice incentives, such as college grants, health benefits, or something people would want to their benefit. but you cannot make it mandatory.
63	80513	3	bn3bpz	en32vk4	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	i think forcing them would only make them grow disdain for it. similar to being forced to go to church every sunday - i didn't grow to appreciate it. i fucking hated it and its a large reason why i began studying into it more and eventually became atheist. what would be infinitely healthier? promoting and encouraging it. especially in young kids. i mean is there any education about this outside of maybe a science teacher bringing it up once? people shouldn't be forced to do things, i don't think. teach people to care. teach. not tell them to.

65	80513	3	bn3bpz	en33gs3	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	mandatory anything is usually terrible public policy. there are a lot of people with physical and mental disabilities which would make this sort of commitment very hard on them.

67	80513	3	bn3bpz	en33kj5	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	real charity cannot be forced. force people to do something and at best it will be half assed, but more often than not this will result in corruption and other issues.
68	80513	3	bn3bpz	en33pun	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	absolutely not make something mandatory and it will be hated. make it an optional program then sure
69	80513	3	bn3bpz	en33z5a	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	people really dont like the draft so no sure there are people that would be willing, but the uproar of being forced to do something might have people try to reverse our gains weve made out of spite
70	80513	3	bn3bpz	en38f95	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	i'm opposed if it's mandatory. there are people that have a plan for their lives and there are people that don't. help those that don't have a plan. don't make it mandatory. use the epa or create a new department in charge of the program, then use the program to help the environment while fighting unemployment. pay a livable wage, hire and train the unemployed, veterans, special needs people, the homeless, ex convicts, etc. use it as a lucrative alternative to free public assistance. there are plenty of people that would apply if a real accessible opportunity was made available.

73	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3luw1	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, because what i do with my time is my decision. not saying i wouldn't volunteer though.
74	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3lwna	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, it is never a good idea to force people to do things they dont want to do. i was forced to go to sunday school as a child and absolutely resented it to the point i lost all interest in anything to do with religion. if you want people to take an interest in something forcing them to do so is the worst possible step you can take.
75	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3m5jw	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, because i don't think that anyone should be forced into completing something they don't wish to do, not unless this mandatory service would provide free food, board, and a generous salary to all workers to compensate for infringing on our freedom of choice. while this would be a huge strain on the budget, not working or going to school for months would be a huge burden on young adults.
76	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3m6pv	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	economy will tank. take people out of the workforce and presumably fund the hypothetical service from taxes.

79	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3nyhb	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no. the government has no right to force me what to do. the government should focus primarily on educating peolple about the environment and why we should protect it. forcing people to do shit most of the time doesn't lead too far.
80	80513	3	bn3bpz	en3nyyr	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	well in my country we have mandatory military service which is complete bullshit. i mean you get trained for like 1 month and then you have 8 months of dicking around ( cleaning and doing maintinance work in some military bases), i would rather work and do actual community service or do some volunteerish work like work in an animal shelter/ do reforestation services etc.
81	80513	3	bn3bpz	en41zd6	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	i do not support any government mandated time of any service.

83	80513	3	bn3bpz	en46zmv	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	that would be another pointless feel-good exercise that shifts responsibility further from the people that are actually fucking the planet. the only environmentalism that has any significant effect is increased industry regulation
84	80513	3	bn3bpz	en4ankj	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no. any form of draft results in a huge waste of time, specially for students, and they pay next to nothing. you can pay people to do it instead.
85	80513	3	bn3bpz	en4ndy0	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	not mandatory, but as a job that people can have, paid by taxes like the police and such.
86	80513	3	bn3bpz	epje1uc	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	absolutely, at least for anyone receiving unemployment benefits. i was at a loose end when i was 19 and did a program set up in australia that was geared towards skilling up people my age by doing a 6 month, hands on conservation program. it was great, taught me things id never have learned otherwise, like how to use a chainsaw, weed management, what native tree to plant where, etc. lots of young guys did the program, i could see it benefiting them, especially the guys that had left school early and hadnt really had the option (or hadnt chosen) to go into a trade or to uni. good stuff. but mandatory? perhaps not
87	80513	3	bn3bpz	epjm4dz	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	maybe not mandatory, but more opportunities for young people (like myself) to help the environment. the youth strikes have convinced many to do things to help the environment (use less plastic, go vegan, buy secondhand etc) but there's not many initiatives for teens and young adults to meet and do environmental services. even things like community gardens and beach cleanup teams could bring people together and help stop climate change. we all need to be supporting greta thunberg - and all of the people fighting for our planet - in making a difference.
88	80513	66	bn3bpz	en2cfzw	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	never. america has fought and bled for freedom. freedom is the reason for america. it's the ideal that bring's us together. when you take that freedom away, even if it's to defend freedom such as in a draft, you're spitting in the face of liberty.
