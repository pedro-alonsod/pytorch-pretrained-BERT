385	55960	5348	bquclv	eo8ormg	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"psychiatrist here. a 30 year old man with mild depressive symptoms was in-and-out of the hospital fairly quickly. he was under pressure from his home life, living with 4 roommates who were making life a bit difficult for him. no suicidal thoughts. he was cleared of all psychopathologies by me and two other doctors. a few months later he came back. same symptoms, however this time he talked about 5 roommates. it felt wrong, and i digged in his story. tried to contact his roommates. he lived alone and was severely psychotic. i have no idea to this day how he hid it so well from everyone. edit: a few more details: the patient talked, dressed and acted normally however after admitting him for a longer period we noticed he talked with his ""roommates"" often. he was single, no contact with his family and somehow working, however in a routine job with little to no personal contact. after a few talks he also claimed other peoples thoughts were sometimes ""thrown at him and sitting on his head"", and he could thus read people's minds against his will. the interesting thing about this patient was, that his internal world somehow fitted the external world when asked - his roommates sounded perfectly plausible (they were not e.g. shadow-people, vikings, 12 m tall) and they teased him by hiding his stuff. but he ate with them, watched tv with them, so on. normally a person with paranoid schizophrenia (paranoid meaning all types of delusions) will have multiple symptoms sometimes easy to see for the untrained eye. the patients can dress, talk and present themselves in odd ways, usually different from cultural norms. they can have incoherent speech, make up words and phrases or are clearly separated from reality (another patient of mine insisted that i was in jail for medicating him, even when we talked). when we quickly ""scan"" a patient for psychotic symptoms we basically look for inconsistencies in the patients experience of the world - the patients normally know ""something is wrong"" or ""weird"" or ""different"", but often belive it is the world around them, that have changed. this is due to discrepancy between what they experience (input), failed assessment of the inputs (due to the thinking disorder) and testing hypothesis based on failed assessments which collide with the real world. this will activate defense mechanisms fx denial, wild explanations, accepting both ""realities"" at the same time, and so on. (e.g ""i am not sick, my doctor must be a bad guy, bad guys are in jail, my doctor are in jail, but my doctor is sitting right in front of me at the same time, he must have an identical twin or this is an alternate reality). this is usually the way delusions are made. to summarize: when we scan for psychosis, we look for inconsistencies between the patients subjective experience of thinking, being and acting and the objective reality accepted by the generel cultural norm. this patient managed to live in a subjective psychotic world that just fitted so well with the objective reality that he tricked several psychiatrists including myself."

"i have a story of a friend who was severely mismanaged. i've probably posted it before, but i'm to lazy to look. for 2 years, my friend had been going to her gp complaining about migraines, bouts of severe vomiting, and dizzy spells. every time, he would order bloodwork, then tell her she was fine. one morning, she woke up, and after a sexy morning with her husband, could barely stand. she was so dizzy and had such a bad migraine. she told her husband not to worry, sent him to work and had her neighbour driver her to the emergency room. she doesnt remember arriving. when she got there, she started acting erratic. they had to sedate her, and sent her for a ct scan of her head. there, they noticed a huge mass in her brain. the hospital wasnt equipped to deal with that, so they sent her by ambulance to the nearest hospital that could, a 4 hour drive away. this hospital immediately sent her for an mri. it wasnt a mass. they could actually see the ""mass"" growing as they did the mri. no, she was having a massive stroke. she was immediately taken in for surgery. they put in a stent, and had to remove most of the left side of her brain as it was all dead. afterwards, she was in a coma for nearly 72 hours. they were uncertain if she would wake up, and if she did, if she would ever recover. thankfully, she did. it took almost a year of physio, and speech therapy (among a few others), but she has made almost a complete recovery. they even had their first child 8 months ago. turns out, she had incredibly high cholesterol. with all the bloodwork that was done, her gp should have caught it. when she confronted him, he told her that her diagnosis was wrong. that she hadn't had a stroke and had made it up. she went after his license."

388	55960	555	bquclv	eo8evsh	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i've had a couple of gems, but the one that really sticks out in my mind actually happened about a month or so ago. a young mother brought in a 6 year old to emerg, she was super nice, and apologetic because she thought that she was wasting my time, because she said that her son had started to develop different spots all over his body and she has no idea why. my initial first thought was chicken pox, so i had some swords and shields up ready to go for the anti-vax debate, but she claimed that she had her son vaccinated at all stages up to that point, and upon closer inspection they were mass of clusters of warts. not uncommon, but because of how rapidly that they were growing, i ordered some blood work to make sure there wasn't an underlying cause as kids immune systems are pretty well equipped to handle that sort of thing. and i'm really glad that she brought him in, because he had a severely low white blood cell count which revealed a primary immune deficiency disease.
389	55960	1519	bquclv	eo8ch55	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"this is my second story to post here but a great story no less. mid 30's man walks into my office with what looks like a black eye and a broken blood vessel in the front of his left eye. he went to his primary and it was simply assumed that he got punched or hit or something, and he was dismissed. he was noted to have high blood pressure, but a script for medicine was written and a follow up in a few months. gentleman comes in to see me to get another opinion on the matter and i look at him and immediately start the line of questions: how long has it been there, do you have a headache, and when you plug your ears with your fingers do you hear a ""wooshing"" sound? he had a cavernous sinus fistula (ccf). i sent him directly to the emergency room with his family of 4 in tow and he was in the or within an hour of arriving. saved his eye and possibly his life that day. the best news: he was a kitchen guy at my local diner which i frequent and they still treat me like royalty there when i come to eat. they all remember the time i saved one of theirs."
390	55960	2659	bquclv	eo89dhm	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	this is a 'i wish i had gotten a second opinion' story. i had a doctor in high school who was unconcerned when i suddenly developed vertical double vision (which was freaking out everyone in emergency, where i had gone initially) and lost 60lbs for no reason. it was only a year or two later when i told him that my arm would fall asleep much faster than normal when i raised it to ask a question in class that he thought there might be something wrong with me. mri ordered. brain tumour found.
391	55960	5426	bquclv	eo86p6s	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	my grandmother had her hip replaced, but the hip always hurt to her. she waited a year, hoping it would go away but it never did, she asked multiple doctors and did multiple x-rays but doctors said the replaced hip was fine. we finally made her go to a private clinic in my hometown, and the doctor saw that the replaced hip was fine and dandy, but the bone around it looked like it was a tad bit eaten by bacteria. so the new doc did an operation, and there was so much pus in the leg it was insane. if my grandmother waited any longer, her blood would become infected and she would have died. thank goodness she went to the clinic.
392	55960	10673	bquclv	eo8813i	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	22 yo guy came in after seeing his primary at another hospital. his mom was my patient and asked if i would see him (i am an internal med doc). he had told his doctor he had a headache. i did a usual full review of symptoms since he was new and he also marked his left testicle had a lump. did exam and he had hard small lump on testicle. knew right away likely had metastatic testicular cancer. 1 stat brain scan and testicular ultrasound later confirmed it. asked him if told other doctor about the lump and he said yes but the other doctor told him it was normal. edit: he lived by the way but it was close a few times. so fellows if you note a lump on your testicle ask for an ultrasound and dont be embarrassed to bring it up. edit 2: for those of you who are concerned after examining yourself: there is a small soft area posteriorly that should be similar on both your testicles known as the epididymis. that is normal. a hard lump on only one side only is not. monthly self checks between ages 15-34 can be done but since rare (5/100,000) not a general recommendation.
393	55960	13932	bquclv	eo8bnkk	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"eye doctor here. i had a patient i saw several months before they came in for their visit but well less than a year, which often means something could be wrong. in this case, as it turns out, nothing was wrong with her by way of complaints, she just wanted to get updated before getting some new glasses. we decided to just run the regular gamut of tests anyway just because we might as well while she was there. she was a 50yo woman, fairly normal exam, perfect vision, retinas showed healthy, but something about her pupils really bothered me before i dilated. we chatted about it and i asked her if she banged her head or anything weird and she said no, but suddenly reveals this crazy history of an old meningioma (a type of tumorous brain growth) she had removed a few years ago. she had decided to omit this from her history with us as she didn't feel it was important, but we went and put it into the charts anyway. turns out she got a ct done two weeks prior to her exam with me which she says turns up completely normal. i tell her she should tell her doctor about this anyway just to cover our bases. fast forward: patient shows up in my office ecstatic to tell me that my examination revealed that her tumor had returned with an incredible vengeance. she had no idea, was totally asymptomatic and the ct she had prior to me showed what was very literally the size of a spec of dust which the radiologist dismissed as ""artifact"". on her return to her doctor, they decided to re-run the ct to cover their bases, and they found a quarter sized tumor. within two weeks the tumor went from the size of a dust particle to a quarter. she was rushed into emergency surgery as the tumor was growing super fast and was close to a blood vessel which could cause a massive stroke. she had it removed that day and returned to me after recovery to tell me of what got discovered as a result of my testing. she is now a long time regular patient i have been seeing for about 10 years. edit: thank you kind giver of gold and silver! its good to be gilded! edit: for those asking about the pupils, they were asymmetric, and the larger one reacted less robustly compared to the fellow eye. this was a marked change from her previous examinations where no pupillary defects were noted."
394	55960	10562	bquclv	eo8862u	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i had a guy come in for a second opinion after the first place didnt bother asking any medical history. of course i took his history and asked more questions as we went. i remember telling him something felt off and we needed to run a test. so i ordered a peripheral vision test. when i got the test back i was shocked by the most classic tumor pattern id ever seen. two weeks later he was in surgery to get it removed. a month after this guy was back in my clinic thanking me. totally different guy. personality was a complete 180, energetic and happy. edit: heres another one i thought of though a bit more sad. but also good at the same time. heres a cautionary tale why urgent cares should never treat eye issues. lady was referred to me after 2 weeks of treated for a red painful eye. the pa and mds that saw her tried allergy meds and anti biotic is thinking it was allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis, or hoping it was mild viral that would resolve on its own. so i took one look at her and knew it was a herpes simplex infection in her cornea. she was in pain and had been mistreated for 2 weeks. got her on anti virals, but after discussing how it was odd she didnt have any active herpetic sores, but had a really bad cough that the er said was just pneumonia and would go away with antibiotics. i told her to get it checked with a pulmonologist because it didnt sound like pneumonia and it wasnt getting better. i saw her 3 months later to monitor her corneal appearance and she came in using a wheelchair. turns out the pulmonologist was blown away that the er had dismissed her. she had a really rare small cell lung cancer. the reason the herpes infection manifested in the first place was her immune system was compromised. she told me the pulmonologist said id saved her life because they caught it early. its been a bit over a year. shes still undergoing treatment but her spirits are strong and shes optimistic as is the pulmonologist.
395	55960	669	bquclv	eo8aw9j	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	my dad ( a pediatrician specializing in neuro issues) was seeing one if his patients at the hospital got dragged into the nicu unexpectedly by a nurse who insisted a baby wasn't well. the attending doc insisted the kid was fine and just tired from a difficult vacuum assist delivery. my dad could tell the baby wasn't okay and managed to talk the parents into a brain scan. the nicu doc insisted my dad was nuts to the parents. dad was right and the kid had a brain bleed and was rushed to surgery. the baby would have died without the nurse bringing my dad in and the parents listening to him. as is, that extra time almost certainly cost brain function.

397	55960	8604	bquclv	eo873oz	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"bit of a weird one, because the request for a second opinion came from an intensivist and i was a contributor to their treatment plan. i work in poisons control. had a call from a green, but very astute young doctor with a middle-aged female patient presenting with a vague 36-48hr history of malaise, confusion, hypoxia from hyperventilation, and hallucinations. on workup was noted to have pulmonary edema (lung fluid buildup), metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, sinus tachy and raised crp & wcc, suggestive of infection but no temperature. the initial diagnosis was sepsis. this keen-eyed doctor, pretty fresh out of med school, decided to do a salicylate level on this lady because the hyperventilation paired with metabolic acidosis and aki was enough to prompt her suspicions of aspirin poisoning, even though they could just as easily be explained by sepsis as well. the level came back high. not huge, but high, which prompted her to phone me for a second opinion on how relevant the finding was in terms of the patient's clinical picture. simultaneously, the patient's family investigated the property and located numerous aspirin blister packs suggesting she had been dosing herself for chronic pain, which was present in the medical history. chronic salicylate poisoning is insidious and has been referred to as a ""pseudosepsis"" in the medical literature as it often causes similar features. comparing a high level in chronic poisoning to the same level in acute poisoning, features are much more severe in chronic poisoning (i.e. pulmonary edema, hypoxia, aki etc) - there is a disparity. we recommended certain treatments (all hail sodium bicarbonate) and the patient made a full recovery after a 2 week hospital stay. whilst there was no question an infective cause was present and contributory, i was impressed with the green doctor's intuition and willingness to consider other causes - i feel like it greatly improved the patient's treatment. edit: some words."
398	55960	3346	bquclv	eo89pgx	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	one of my sisters friends was diagnosed with cancer at age 10. they were advised to pack up their stuff and move across the country to go to a specialist because they would have to stay there for at least a year. they even had to hire a private plane so she wouldnt get sick on the plane from any passengers. well before they left they got a second opinion saying it was pneumonia. then they got a third that again said it is was pneumonia. now several years later she is healthy and never got cancer treatment and has been tested for cancer regularly.
399	55960	2978	bquclv	eo86gqj	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor, but the patient. went to my family doctor with the worst headache of my entire life. she dismissed it, telling me it was a tension headache and that i should take a tylenol and lay down in a dark room. over the course of the next month, i saw her a total of 13 times, each time with worsening symptoms. first it was dizziness, then vomiting, then eventually i could no longer see out of my right eye. every time she told me it was just a tension headache or a weird migraine, gave me a prescription for pain killers and sent me on my way. the final straw was when i was no longer able to walk properly. i would try to take a step, but all i could manage was this weird shuffle. she reluctantly agreed to send me to a neurologist. the next day i showed up at his office and was in there for less than a minute. he took one look in my eyes and immediately called an ambulance. turns out i had hydrocephalus. my ventricles were 5x the size they were supposed to be, and my brain was literally being squeezed out of my head. go figure!

402	55960	28560	bquclv	eo87wak	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i'm an emergency medicine doc in the midwest usa the patient was transferred from rural nowhere to our tertiary care facility (big hospital with every specialist). call was of really bad quality, but the transferring physician described a 21 year old male that had rapid heart rate and breathing rate, low blood pressure, low oxygen, confusion, and a severe opacification on his chest x-ray on the right side. diagnosed pneumonia. he gave him a ton of fluids, started antibiotics, put him on a ventilator, but he wasn't getting better, and wanted to send him to us. sure, send away. an hour later the gentleman arrives, and looks young, fit, and not the type to just drop dead from pneumonia. we roll him onto our stretcher and find. a huge stab wound in his back. the x-ray finding was his entire right chest full of blood. we put a tube in it, gave him back some blood, and he had to go for surgery to fix the bleeding. lesson: look at your patient.
403	55960	6215	bquclv	eo85spv	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	a bit of background: in my field of audiology we have people licensed to diagnose not only hearing issues but balance disorders and other factors impacting listening and understanding. we also have another field who popped up when it was not considered as ethical for us to *treat* those more serious hearing issues (i.e. with hearing aids) but they dont need the same doctorate level training, just barely high school or some college depending on jurisdiction. so i had a patient come in with a serious difference between left and right hearing and this in itself is considered a red flag because both ears are exposed to the same things over time. and there are very few explanations as to why one would get so bad. the patient could hardly understand words on that bad side and the better ear was pretty good overall, just minor hearing loss perhaps age-related. immediately upon seeing these test results, the ent and i agreed to send this patient for an mri of the head because something was off. the patient confirmed no mri or medical treatment had been recommended in the past and only hearing aids by this lesser-trained hearing aid dealer (working for a popular u.s. chain). the patient had been wearing these hearing aids already for a few years. the mri results came back. massive tumor on the hearing nerve. the hearing aid dealer is being investigated currently for malpractice (or more specifically a violation of state laws regarding red flags). edit: since a few of you are asking what happened with the patient, ill paste what got buried below. i dont usually get to see these cases if they get sent for surgery. im not in a big metro area so the very specialized ents (neurotologists) have their own audiologists to handle post-op testing. anticlimactic, i agree

411	55960	424	bquclv	eo8ayb6	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	at one of my practica placements, i conduct psychological evaluations for children and adults referred by the court system, typically following court-mandated removal. the referrals almost always ask for differential diagnoses and treatment recommendations. many of the children have previous psychiatric diagnoses and are prescribed a slew of medications. in this sense, the psychological evaluation is a comprehensive second opinion that requires me to sort through previous diagnoses, background information, and data from the assessments i administer. i would say that the most common misdiagnoses that i see among children are bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). often times when a child has a traumatic history (as many of my clients do), they exhibit signs of hypervigilance, avoidance, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral issues. the hypervigilence looks like the hyperactivity found in adhd and the hypomania/mania in bipolar disorder. emotional dysregulation and avoidance (e.g., social withdrawal) is easily mistaken for the depressive side of bipolar disorder and can also result in disruptive behaviors characteristic of adhd. there are also some serious repercussions of prescribing children psychotropic medications to treat psychiatric disorders they do not have. to answer the question directly, its rewarding when you have the opportunity to help clarify a childs psychiatric diagnosis and ideally write treatment recommendations that improve their prognosis. im a fan of comprehensive second opinions, especially in the arena of mental health.

419	55960	1449	bquclv	eo864le	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	a bulk of my career lately seems to be maligned patients with legitimate medical issues who've been labeled as hypochondriacs and sent through for a psych work up and meds / counseling. people with histories of all kinds of endocrine issues, like thyroid cancer / thyroidectomy patients who see someone once every two years about their thyroid and never have labs checked or med dosages fixed. or diabetics with poorly controlled sugars, people who've had bowels surgeries and take time release meds, and then wonder why they aren't working. the piece meal system of health care in the us is really doing such a disservice to actual humans. so many specialists and no one piecing together the big picture.
420	55960	174	bquclv	eo8fj25	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	it's not exactly what you're asking, but i'm a primary care doctor who had a 2 year old refugee girl in who had a sore throat, and something just didn't sit right with me - it could have been easy to just say she was under the weather but she sort of was holding herself too stiffly and breathing too consciously. anyway, particularly with the language barrier i sent them to the emergency room because i was concerned there might be a foreign body in her throat and i didn't have the proper tools to look, and it turns out there was - she had swallowed a button battery and it was eating through her esophagus. one more day and she very well may have died. as it turns out, she had some scarring and slight narrowing but i'm hopeful that it won't really affect her significantly moving forward. for any parents out there, be exceedingly careful about button batteries in the house for young children. young kids like to put things in their mouths and swallow them, and button batteries are basically the perfect size and shape for that. the morbidity and mortality rate is quite high and it's bad news bears.
421	55960	20191	bquclv	eo85oi0	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"oh god where to start. i literally just admitted this lady to icu.had been coughing for ages, 60 lb weight loss, smoker for 50 yrs. now she can't breathe and i got a ct 6cm mass looks very suspicious for lung cancer. and the doctors for 4 yrs throughout this just gave her vitamin d/e even though she was losing massive weight and coughing up blood. another guy who came in looked pale as a ghost. chief complaint was fatigue. one lab test later found out his hemoglobin was 4 (barely on the cusp of survival). seems like he had iron deficiency anemia for yrs, doctor gave him some iron, he got better but no one looked into why he got it (#1,2,3 reason in an older guy is colon cancer). he died 4 months later from metastatic colon cancer. another story- last month was about to take a long trip across the pacific. 1 hr in on the flight they ask for a doctor.i volunteer myself. i see this lady literally gasping for air.like waving her hands in the air cuz she can't breathe. look through the meds.she's obviously an asthmatic. listen to her lungs and faint wheezing no air movement at all. i later grounded that plane because there was another sixteen hrs to go and she was on verge of being intubated. later i get more story from family member. apparently she wasn't been able to sleep well for past two weeks. doctor just gave her sleeping meds.more and more of it. told her flying no problem.i ask the family why can't she sleep? is it because she wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for air (classic sign of uncontrolled asthma). they're like yes, how did you know?. sleeping meds prob among worst things she could have gotten and almost killed the patient by saying she could fly. people who get diagnosed with ""bronchitis"" when they have heart failure and literally drowning in fluid. there are doctors who give antibiotics and steroids for everything esp when they have no idea what's going on. maybe i'm biased because i work at an academic center so i see all the cases who get referred in because they're too sick or no one can figure out but at least a few times a week i'm like wow this person could have been saved or not end up this way if someone cared enough earlier on. i'm going to say this as a doctor. it's honestly scary every day how many patients i see are completely mismanaged. some doctors in urgent care see like 45 patients in a day. how is that possible to be thorough??? like if only patients knew what the doctors missed or what not.half the time i really think it's like going to an bad auto shop and not realizing they're just making half the shit up. same thing happens in medicine and except people's lives suffer because of it. edit-added a story. thank you to whoever gave me silver/gold. let me say something.people are saying i'm gregory house or something. i'm not. i purposely didn't choose stories that were some esoteric diagnoses. everything i picked is like bread and butter medical student level. half of being a good doctor is knowing what questions to ask. sometimes you don't even know what's important or not. the other half is caring. too many just put a band-aid on the problem and punt the patient to someone else. is it the doctors fault? i don't know but i do know the medical system in the us provides no incentives for doctors to actually practice good medicine. in fact, i bring in less money if i'm thorough versus i do the same thing every patient and see 100 patients a day (which is what some do unfortunately). i have tons more stories, hopefully i'll get to share some more but for now have to sleep (was on call overnight). &#x200b; edit x2: thank you again for all the gilds! i don't even know what they all do or mean but i'm very grateful nonetheless. few more things i wanted to say - there are plenty of amazing doctors out there, not all are bad. we all put our lives on hold for ten years for altruistic purposes. not everyone just wants to make a quick buck so i hope i didn't characterize it as such. i tried to respond to some comments but i don't have time to respond to all. a lot asked - ""so how do i find a good doctor?"" the answer is.i don't know. i've tried looking for good ones myself and it's hard. i joke you should find the doctors all the other doctors go to because i have a higher ""bs"" meter when i meet a bad one. doctor rating websites are garbage. i've seen doctors get great ""ratings"" because they just hand out opioids/benzodiazepines to everyone even if all his or her patients become addicted later. a lot of it is really your gut feeling. a good one should listen to you and most importantly, sometimes be confident enough to say ""i don't know but i'll look it up or send you to someone who does know."" the scariest ones are those who don't even realize what they don't know. and the most perplexing thing to me.if you don't like an auto mechanic or realtor, you would find another right? do the same for doctors! it's your life.can be a difference between living or dying one day. go find someone who will advocate for you, it's the least you can do for yourself."

423	55960	746	bquclv	eo89i06	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"as an ophthalmologist, i've seen quite a few misses unfortunately. the eye is just not very well studied outside of this field so many doctors do not feel comfortable with the eye which is understandable. there was one case of a small child who had a minor trauma to the eye. the er called and stated that everything looked fine and she was most likely ready to go home but would prefer if we came down to take a look. got down there, examined her and she had an open globe (eyeball was ruptured meaning there is actually a hole in the eye that needs to be closed surgically). was very glad we got that call. another time a patient came in to the er complaining of complete loss of vision. upon exam his vision was light perception only in both eyes. this means that the patient cannot even see a hand waving 2 inches from their face but they can still make out light vs dark. he stated he had went to the er 2 months ago when his vision first started deteriorating but was told he had ""conjunctivitis"" and given antibiotics ointment. he did not return to the er for 2 months because he did not have insurance and was homeless at the time. my alarm bells were already ringing at this point. i did an exam to look at the retina and saw numerous white plaques which is a sign of inflammation with infection being the most concerning. the patient ended up having syphilis that had gone into his eye and made him blind. unfortunately, at this point his prognosis for recovering vision was poor even with treatment. this next one was not really a miss but more of a delayed diagnosis. a patient came to the er 1 month after a gunshot wound to the head. did surprisingly well since the bullet missed most of the important structures in the brain. he was back in the er as the swelling on his eye had not gotten better. it's common after a big trauma like that for the eye to be swollen for 1 to 2 weeks before getting better. he also was complaining of double vision. on exam his eye was swollen and being pushed forward out of orbit and he could not move his eye to the left. given his history i was worried he developed something called an artery venous fistula which is where an artery and a vein combine causing the high pressure in the artery to enter the vein and build up a back pressure causing the vein to engorge because it can no longer drain blood. got a ct scan to confirm. patient went to surgery the next day. i do caution the general public to be weary of this thread though. it is unfair to doctors look at this thread and claim incompetence. diseases usually develop on a continuum age and one doctor might catch it at a later date because it has had more time to present itself. there is also a stepwise approach to medicine. if you gave everyone with a headache a ct scan there would be more harm then good. it's possible that when a person gets a second opinion they see the first doctor already ruled a lot of things out so they are in a better position to diagnose, whereas if you had stayed with the original doctor and continued to work with him he may have gotten to the diagnosis as well. as a patient it can be frustrating but be mindful that most doctors do want what's best for you and there may be a lot of things going on in the background you are unaware of. for example when patients come in for cold symptoms, they assess usually frustrated when they are told there is no treatment needed. they feel like it is a waste of a trip. but that doctor used his medical knowledge to 1. reassure you 2. avoid harmful if unneeded antibiotics 3. made sure you didn't actually have a diagnosis that requires emergent treatment"

(dont even get me started on how stupid the special olympics can be, with literal ringers used to win gold in the lowest division.) a man chest bumped her and fell on top of her and we think thats what caused it. shes predisposed to these kinds of things bc of her down syndrome - and had open heart surgery at 2 for a hole in her heart anyway, shes a champ. heading back to work today unhappily, but excited because shes been cleared to go to a special needs prom next friday

"i am a doctor (primary care with some emergency), and can't really think of any good examples of this right now. it's definitely happened, but never in a way that i end up holding it against the other doctor involved. you kind of end up too busy doing your job. one phrase that i find myself repeating to patients is ""i don't really understand what \[previous doctor\] was thinking here, but the way that the guidelines/my experience has taught me to approach this problem is \[hopefully correct solution\]"" most of the time, the fact that the patient has gone looking for a second opinion or another consult tells you about their level of concern and changes your management. doctor #1 might see a patient with 2 days of low abdo pain and (correctly) reassure the patient that it's probably nothing and come back in a week if symptoms continue. patient then goes to doctor #2 a couple of days later, more worried and cheesed off at #1. with the increased level of concern, #2 then orders an ultrasound that reveals ovarian cancer. the issue here is that both doctors are correct. the next abdominal pain that comes in to see either doctor at 2 days of symptoms will still receive reassurance as their primary treatment, because it will most likely be something simple like constipation or cramping. giving every patient with simple symptoms an ultrasound is not economically feasible. i would hope that any diagnoses i've missed or mismanaged (and i assume there's been a few) were picked up by another doctor and that they also gave me the benefit of the doubt. (do i win by being the first not not a doctor?)"

444	55960	5299	bquclv	eo85k4m	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doc, but happened to my wife and i. she was 3 months pregnant and did ultrasound. all normal. baby heart rate was 99, and healthy. however for some reason, the ultrasound tech forgot to measure something and doc ordered a second ultrasound. second appt in about a month, as my wife wanted to delay as she hated having to drink so much and not pee so the ultrasound comes out clearer. i couldn't be with her for second ultrasound as work got in the way. however she calls me tearfully saying that the doctor ordered she abort the fetus for her safety and her health and she insisted on calling me to let me know before she did the procedure. apparently the baby heart rate hadn't changed since first ultrasound a month ago, and this was bad enough to put mom at risk in pregnancy. i fucking flew to the hospital. i can't remember how i got there but i crossed heavy traffic to the hospital in about 10 min of what is normally a 20min trip. parked on curb, jumped out and rushed to her room. thankfully nothing happened to her yet. and i just camped there insisting on another ultrasound. i kept telling the doctor it was a copy paste error. you see, the heart rate from first ultrasound to second was exactly the same. i knew - just knew, that the tech copy pasted the first report and forgot to update that rate. i screamed bloody murder if anyone would touch my wife. security was almost called until another doc came in and said just do another ultrasound to decide the issue. the ordered a second ultrasound and heartrate was normal. my son is now 10 and i remember that fear and rage everyday i look at him.

446	55960	77	bquclv	eo98zrb	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	this is my own personal story. i am a np and about 8 years ago, i began having yeast infections. i didn't think much of it at first, it happens. they began to become more frequent. i took diflucan, it would go away. fast forward five years and i am now popping diflucan like skittles. my ob/gyn told me 'well, you just need to eat nothing but plain salad, sometimes these are sacrifices women need to make'. i'm not kidding. this actual conversation happened. gyn is not my specialty but i did some research. i questioned if i might have some genetic deficiency and was told 'that's just nonsense' and 'are you sure it's that bad?' eventually i was referred to a specialist who was negligent (she obtained a fungal culture, never ordered it, and then told me to go back to the gyn who sent me to her when i wouldn't stop inquiring about the results). i never gave up because i couldn't. i was in constant pain. i went to a new ob/gyn who obtained and ordered a fungal culture. she called me in a panic because she had never seen anything like it. i was referred to an infectious disease specialist and failed all treatment. i was referred to a different id specialist and he took one look at my labs and shook his head. the yeast was resistant to every drug available. i also have a genetic deficiency where my body doesn't mount an appropriate immune response to yeast. so i took boric acid. it cured me. poison saved my life.

456	55960	60	bquclv	eo8dkqs	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"not a doctor, but this happened to me when i was 2, my parents have told me the tale multiple times. i started being a less and less cheery 2 year old. i wasn't very communicative so my parents inferred that i was sick. i would grab my stomach and bend over. it got worse when i ate or drank things. obviously looked like i had some kind of stomach/abdominal pain. my parents weren't sure what to do, we were very poor at the time, i didn't even have a pediatrician yet, they just took me in to the er worried it was something life threatening. the er doctors looked at me and told my parents one of my intestines was twisted on itself and i needed surgery within 24 hours. my parents were freaking out, my dad called old friend of his whose opinion he greatly valued/trusted. his friend was like ""have they cut into him yet! stop! take him to this pediatrician, my granddaughters all go there and he's amazing."" they took me in for a second opinion, but didn't tell the pediatrician about the first opinion, just said ""hey look he's in pain, what's wrong?"". pediatrician took a look at me, looked in my throat and visibly winced. he wrote a prescription for amoxicillin and gave me an injection on the spot for some antibiotics. he said to make sure i take it twice a day for the next few days and i'd be fine in a few days. at that point my dad revealed the first opinion. he told the pediatrician that he had been told i needed emergency surgery. the pediatrician's response was ""whoever said that was mistaken, he has a severe strep throat infection, the antibiotics will clear it right up."" my parents asked about me holding my stomach. my pediatrician said that's a normal response in small children who feel the sore throat pain when swallowing. sure enough, within a few days i was back to my cheery self. if my dad hadn't seeked out a second opinion, they probably would have gone through with the surgery, opened me up, found nothing wrong, closed me back up, given me antibiotics as a routine post-surgery thing, and those antibiotics would have fixed me up. who knows if they would have fessed up to their mistake or my parents would just be stuck with a huge bill for a misdiagnosed problem. that pediatrician was an amazing man, he was my doctor until i turned 18 and my family recommended him to everyone and anyone that needed recommendations. he's long since retired, but i do think of him every once in a while. you da man, dr. m!"

463	55960	47	bquclv	eo9hzqy	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor, but a paramedic, so hopefully i wont be laughed out of the comments section for this. about a year ago, i got called to a 15 y/o male whod collapsed in the parking lot of his residential apartment complex. as a 911 service, we get called to a lot of situations that might seem emergent to people going about their daily business, but appear relatively routine or mundane to us in terms of acuity; additionally, because it was 15 min before shift change, and 15 year olds rarely collapse from spontaneous cardiac arrest, i was fully prepared to call bs on this before we arrived on scene. turns out the kid was, indeed, in total arrest, and we took over from the bystanders who initiated compressions and went into full code mode. our standards of care mandate that we work a code for up to 40 minutes, depending on patient presentation, before we call a doc for termination of resuscitative efforts, and so we worked this kid for 40 minutes in the parking lot and still had no return of pulses. at this point, and i still have no idea whether my decision was based in emotion, clinical observation, or just a gut feeling, i elected to transport a working cardiac arrest (something we rarely do) rather than call for tor. got to the ed (level 2 trauma, cath lab, primary stroke, great facility), wheel the kid with ongoing compressions and interventions into the room, and the ed doc (in my experience, a fantastic doctor) takes a look at the patient, feels for a pulse, and says [this patient] is gone and gets ready to call it. then he looks at me, and im pretty shattered at this point, and says hell do an ultrasound to demonstrate. conducts the ultrasound, and lo and behold, the kids heart is beating: weakly, but beating. kid gets transferred to pedi icu, wakes up within the week, and attended a survivors dinner 2 months ago where i tried not to cry excessively in front of him. overconfidence and an inability to share perspective/clinical opinions are a dangerous path to navigate in the medical profession. i was enormously lucky, as was this patient, to have multiple trained providers in this case, and if the doc hadnt performed the ultra. well, this story would be a much sadder one.
464	55960	1510	bquclv	eo838l9	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	heard this from an ultrasound tech, a man came in severely injured after a car accident. the man had a laceration above his right thigh along with a puncture wound from his door or something from the car, can't remember. the doctor ordered an ultrasound of this mans leg in order to make sure the vein had not been punctured. the guy was doped up on painkillers by the time he had gotten to the tech, so he was loopey as hell while she was performing the scan. she felt something metallic against his arm when she was positioning his thigh to get a full scan. she asked him if his leg had another puncture wound on the inside of his thigh. he told her no, he just has a massive piercing on his penis, like a fucking bull horn or some shit. she asked him to position his privates away from her while she performed the rest of the scan. breaking hipaa laws, this tech told her husband (at home not at work) about this mans piercing, her husband was a mri tech at the same hospital. the next day, the same man was scheduled for an mri on his thigh. now mri's are magnetic resonance imaging, so its literally a fucking magnet that will fuck up piercings. because that ultra sound tech had broken hipaa laws, she actually had saved this mans dick. her husband warned him to remove all piercings from his body and made sure this man knew that he meant all piercings. not exactly a second opinion story but whatever.
465	55960	727	bquclv	eo83lvp	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor but a lucky patient, during my last 4 days of boot camp, i woke up 2 hours before we were supposed to and i couldn't breathe, i was gagging and choking and it took about 2 minutes before i could again. everyone thought i was just malingering so that i'd get out of the last 4 days and relax until i went home. went to a doctor and they did basic tests, said it could be my allergies or something (suuuper allergic to pollen but not this bad) and i was sent back to the barracks. my trouble with breathing continues and i'm more sore than i have been since the first week or so. anyways, i go home (still live with my family) and and i was obviously tired and sore and wanted to be lazy for a bit, so when the first couple days i was sleeping for 16 hours a day my family just thought i was exhausted and needed rest. after 7 or so days of this they got tired of me being lazy and decided make me get up outa bed and do a bunch of house work, wash their cars just anything to keep me outa bed. i tell them i don't feel good and everything still hurts, my chest feels heavy and i need to get back in bed but they aren't having it. finally i convince them to let me see the doctor, but they just agree its muscle pains primarily, and that i need to keep using them to eventually make the soreness go away. eventually, going back to university, one of my professors notices i don't look to well, i explain my symptoms and tell him what's going on, (this was a math prof. not even medically trained just common sense) he suggests i get tested for mono, and lo and behold guess what i got? turns out, the people doing the health screening neglected several people, and the officers in charge of us said if ever out of water share canteens with the closest person to you. so no running to refill it or anything, this apparently spread mono throughout my battalion. when i got a doctor who confirmed this, they later find out my spleen was on the verge of rupturing, and if i had gone another few days or a week more, ~~it would have and i would have drowned internally~~ could have caused a life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. &#x200b; edit: drowning internally is not possible, this was likely an exaggeration from me trying to remember and retell the story over the years, maybe a mixup in my head or something. in actuality i would have just become really really sick, would have required surgery and shit but i wouldn't have drowned and died. apologies!
466	55960	91	bquclv	eo8dw8a	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	from the other side, patients mother who had to kick and scream for a second opinion. my daughter fell off the bed when she was 8 months old. i checked her over and nothing was obviously wrong, she cried for a couple of minutes and then seemed okay. but i noticed as the evening went on she wasnt crawling much, she would start and give a very angry yell, not a pain cry but straight pissed off and sit back up. she went to sleep like normal and i started worrying if i should have taken her to the doctor right away. my hubs says she seems all right, lets see how shes doing in the morning. as soon as i wake up i decide im going to get her checked out. shes still acting normal except for not crawling, but shes playing and babbling and i figure im probably overreacting but i cant stop worrying. im at the doctor as soon as he opens, he tells me i should have taken her to the er immediately after any kind of fall but doesnt think anything is wrong. he checks her arm, cant find swelling, shes not reacting to him manipulate her arm, he says shes fine. i ask if she can be x-rayed and he says its not necessary. i answer that i want to be certain. he tells me its overkill but if it makes me feel better then i should do it. he writes a note for the er and we head there. er doctor examines her and tells me shes fine and that x-rays can be upsetting for babies and he doesnt think she needs it. he tells me if she continues acting funny for a few days i can bring her back. i ask what would happen if something was wrong and i let it go untreated that long. he shrugs and says they can do the x-ray if it makes me feel better. there was a broken bone in her wrist. the doctor actually apologized to me and gave me props for pushing for the x-ray when i felt something was wrong. when it comes to my kids, id definitely rather be safe than sorry.

"not a doctor, but about my wife. 26(f) at the time. my wife was 10 weeks pregnant, and started getting excruciating headaches. she was projectile vomiting even 1/2oz of water. could not keep anything down. so we go to the er at 1am monday morning. they give her pain meds and 2 bags of iv. diagnosis: morning sickness. monday night, same thing pain meds maybe taking a 10/10 down to 9/10, could still not eat/drink anything. so back to er monday night. they called her ob (older lady) who said to admit her. they put her in a room and gave her stronger pain meds and iv. still could not eat, every smell/sound made the headache worse. but managed to get it down to a 7/10 pain level. she was there 3 days and her ob never came to visit. on thursday she was discharged. we went home, and she said she wanted a slice of cheese pizza. she ate it and kept it down. but the next day the pain meds had worn off and she started vomiting and headache 10/10 again even with prescription meds. so back to the er on friday. this time when they called her ob office, a different ob was on call (young guy), he said admit her, and came to visit her at 1am. he asked hospital (hospital in town of 50k people with small icu) to get an mri. the hospital did not want to consult radiologist on weekend, because that would have been overtime. so she was medicated until monday morning when the ob had her down first in line for an mri. he came up half way through, said."" radiologist does not need to look at it, she has a cvt (blood clot in brain, from forehead to top of spine). he moved her to icu, then helicopter ride to big city hospital. i asked neurosurgeon if she would fully recover. he said if it came on quickly yes, if it was slow, probably always risk of some clot causing stroke later. after she gave birth, she had another mri, 100% gone. so. her first ob who never visited her, almost killed her by not listening. she was getting worse for the 7 days she was in/out of the hospital. not to mention when i ordered her records, her ob stated that she was drug seeking. needless to say, we switched to a high risk ob at big hospital and dumped the lazy ob."
473	55960	44	bquclv	eo8pfla	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doc, but a second opinion likely saved my life a few years ago. its a long story, but hopefully it helps someone else not make the same mistakes i did. tl;dr: be your own advocate. if something feels off- it very well might be. id just switched to new health insurance and had picked my gp but hadnt been in to see her yet when i started getting sick. high fever, headache, fatigue, and back pain. i tried to rest it off but it was persistent so thought it best to see the doc just in case. i didnt have tons of time around work, so i popped into urgent care where they took a look and ran some x-rays and told me i had mild pneumonia. they prescribed some meds and told me to take it easy. i was 25 at the time and had unfortunately already experienced pneumonia and walking pneumonia in years prior. based on my previous experiences, i thought this was an odd diagnosis as i wasnt coughing at all. the last few times id had it i was hacking up a lung so to speak. but- i was busy and tired and trusted them so i went on my way. i took the meds, rested, stayed home, but i was still sick- getting worse. so i decided to make a proper appointment with a doc to get this really checked out because something felt wrong. unfortunately, my gps schedule was full for the next month+ so i saw the next available doc. well call her dr a. i went to see dr a about a week after urgent care. told her all my symptoms, how long itd been going on, etc. she told me it was regular old pneumonia and it was normal for my symptoms to get worse before they got better and that i should keep taking tylenol for the headaches and fever and monitor my temp (which was sitting at 100+ pretty much constantly). i told her id had pneumonia before and this felt different. she made me feel like a liar and an idiot for even suggesting she might not be right with my diagnosis. i left feeling bummed, angry and still very sick. a few days later, my fatigue was insane and i started to see these painful bright red bumps cropping up on my legs. id had hives before, and knew it wasnt that- no itching. im allergic to both sulfa and penicillin antibiotics so i was worried i was having a reaction to the ones they gave me. i went in to see dr a again. by then my legs were completely covered in huge raised pinkish red patches. plus i still had a fever, chills, back pain, fatigue and headache. when i arrived, she told me she didnt know what the red patches were. she brought in her student for a second opinion- he didnt know either. then she told me to go get blood drawn so she could run some tests. in the meantime, she told me to keep taking tylenol and monitor my fever. still treating me like a liar and an idiot. so i go down to get blood drawn which was excruciating. i was definitely dehydrated- they couldnt find a vein and tried both arms twice. id given blood many times before then and never cried, but after the fourth try i was almost sobbing. i had a 100+ fever at this point and told them to please just take it from the veins on my hand which they had refused because it hurt more. im like lady im already crying- just do it. they do it. no pain. i leave. i wait to hear from dr a with results. no word from her so i call. she says she didnt find anything and to keep monitoring. at this point i had been sick for weeks. im averaging 101 fever daily. ibuprofen isnt helping. i can barely walk. the red patches on my legs are spreading to my arms and torso. im so tired i can barely do anything and my back pain and headache are constant. im starting to notice breathing trouble- little bouts of too-fast breathing and my heart rate feels abnormally high. im miserable. i schedule a phone appointment with dr a because im too weak to go in. she misses it. that night, as im laying in bed with a 103+ fever that keeps going up, i start hyperventilating, or what feels like that. i cant catch my breath. i feel like i cant breathe. my heart rate is nuts. i know i need to go back to the hospital, i try to get up but i can barely stand. fun! so my boyfriend carries me down the stairs and around the corner to our car (apartment life!) and we head to urgent care (im poor and trying real hard to avoid er bills by that point). they see me immediately (yikes!) and after evaluating me and my chart for all of five minutes, this angel nurse brings in another doc who confirms that i need to go to the er now. angel nurse then proceeds to pop me in a wheelchair and personally wheel me to the er which was next door to avoid sitting me with ambulance bills, though its against their policy. once i get to the er im pumped wit fluids, given oxygen and am told my actual gp, who ive never met, will be in to see me very soon. several docs come by to take blood, evaluate, ask questions. they dont know what ive got but theyre going to figure it out. im so relieved! im admitted to the hospital and finally meet my actual gp in the morning. she is amazing and takes me seriously- asking questions and telling me what other departments shes looping in to help. she keeps popping back in to let me know where theyre at with a diagnosis. by late morning- shes figured it out: fungal pneumonia with a complication (the red splotches) erythema nodosum. the antibiotics id been given didnt do anything to help, which is why id been getting worse. everything worked out fine- i got the right meds and recovered. the red patches faded to bruises. but every time i think about that experience, i just wish i had been more insistent with dr a. i was so angry with her for not taking me seriously and not doing her job. her blas attitude towards my health, and my failure to push back, landed me in the freakin hospital. moral of the story: get a second opinion. and if your doc treats you like a liar- get a new one immediately. dont wait around and definitely dont see that doc again. edit: spelling!

"considering this thread has turned into ""moms of reddit, what is your i am taking you back to the doctor moment"" i will give my story. i was away at school and had noticed some changes. i was pissing all the time, dropping weight, and not really eating a ton. after a few weeks of grinding through it like an idiot, i decided it was time to go to the dr on campus. i had called my mom like i normally would every couple of days and told her i wasn't really feeling well and was throwing up, so i was heading to the doc. she offered to have my dad drive down and come pick me up so i could spend the weekend there, but i declined. anyways, went to the dr, he checked me out, said nothing seemed to concerning, but recommended coming back the following day when the lab was open for blood work. i left the campus dr and checked my phone and it had a voicemail on it from my mom who said my dad was already on his way down and to be ready to come home. i got home, she took one look at me, and told me we were going to the er. got there and had a blood sugar reading of 896 and was in dka. spent a week and a half in the icu. mothers intuition definitely probably saved my ass."

"i work at a comprehensive cancer center. of all the requests our pathologists receive for second opinions, **10%** result in a change of diagnosis  either someone has cancer but was originally told everything was ok, or someone doesn't have cancer but was told they did, or someone was diagnosed with one type of cancer when it was really a different type (which will affect how it should be treated). as our chief of pathology once said, ""a second opinion is almost always a good idea. if your doctor is offended when you say you'd like to get a second opinion, find another doctor."""

480	55960	69	bquclv	eo89z8u	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i'm a resident doctor. some lady was in the icu for bad myasthenia gravis. you get all weak and shit because your body attacks this dude in your blood you need to make your muscles work. myasthenic crisis is when this is bad enough that it affects your ability to breath. there's some cool shit you can do with these patients because they have progressive weakness that recovers over a short period of time; having them raise their eyes up and hold it and their eyes drift down or talk with them for a few minutes and watch their speech get progressively slurred. anyway, this lady had a pretty classic case and it was kinda neat to see one patient have all the findings. her story was classic, she sounded like a board exam question. misdiagnosed for months with bronchitis. someone else said it and i'd agree, a lot of it is urgent care and pcp mid levels and docs who don't have the time to actually talk to their patients. we exchanged her blood and got her on therapy and she's fine. nice lady, too.
