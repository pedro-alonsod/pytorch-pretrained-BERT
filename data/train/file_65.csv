1059	50785	2521	buso57	eph9kqs	of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	"it's going to sound weird, but the rescuers. i hadn't seen that movie in about a decade-and-a-half when i picked up the blu-ray during a local sale. i. was also rather smashed when i was watching it. anyway, i'm watching it after a few drinks when the opening comes on. it's almost like how, when you're a kid and you don't realize that you've heard what is an adult joke because you were too pure and innocent? well. as an adult, it truly hits just how overwhelmingly *sad* the story is, especially since the opening song, ""the journey"" is almost like a lament. this is a young child who was taken against her will, in a situation where she could most certainly *die* and a note in a bottle is honestly her only real chance of escape. i admit, i definitely cried the next few times i watched that movie. the same for the scene after medusa insults penny, although that was more due to pure rage."

1073	50785	15635	buso57	eph2pvq	of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	scream. the tension and terror were built up perfectly and the eventual killing of drew barrymore's character was shocking. not just in its brutality (which was *quite* graphic for its time), but because such a major name was killed off that soon into a movie. the opening kill is a tried and true horror trope, but it had never been done before with such a big name so early in a film. for the rest of the film, every time you saw a big name show up (neve campbell, david arquette, courtney cox), you weren't sure if they were going to make it to the end of the film or not.
1074	50785	13450	buso57	eph211h	of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	the opening scene in reservoir dogs completely sums up everyone's character. * mr. pink goes on his logical rant about why he doesn't tip showing he is the logic thinker. he also claims always to be the one acting like a professional. later in the film, he tries to keep the group together and stay professional. * mr. white takes the book from joe when he gets tired of hearing him drone on and on about toby showing they are close friends * mr. blond offers to shoot mr. white if he doesnt give the book back to joe. he even shots him with a finger gun. foreshadowing mr. blonds violent actions later in the film * finally, when joe ask who didn't tip mr. orange immediately rats out mr. pink. mr. orange, of course, is the undercover cop and the rat.
