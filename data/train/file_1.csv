2840	41759	26624	bqg2xi	eo49iqv	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	learn to say no, if a request makes you uncomfortable you can say no, even it's to family or friends! it's healthy to set boundaries and learn to respect others people's too :)

2844	41759	20922	bqg2xi	eo48ezt	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	i knew you were masturbating, im just not going to say anything
2845	41759	13347	bqg2xi	eo49wy3	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	your parents are just flawed people too. they are [mostly] trying their best, but will still make mistakes.
2846	41759	6605	bqg2xi	eo45l03	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	it's okay to take some time to take care of your mental health, nobody will hate you for it
2847	41759	6409	bqg2xi	eo49r29	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	delete your internet profiles every few years. your boss in 5 years does not want to see your shit from today, and we all post dumb shit. google yourself and make sure those accounts are deleted as well.
2848	41759	8336	bqg2xi	eo470cq	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	that we love and care about them, i think we often get caught up in day-to-day life and forget to tell them this.
2849	41759	1484	bqg2xi	eo4eeul	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	1. your emotions wont be this intense forever. but they are real and valid. my parents always invalidated my feelings  too dramatic, its just your hormones, youll grow out of it, you dont know how good you have it  while on some base level they possibly were right, it didnt mean my feelings werent real and intense in that moment. allow yourself to feel what you feel. but dont wallow or feed the depression kitty. it does get better. 2. if social media makes you feel shitty, just stop. it makes everyone feel shitty  even the people whose lives seem so much better and glamorous than yours. chances are, theyre posting that stuff to not feel shitty too. remember, everyone is posting their greatest hits. remember, everybody poops  even the girl posting glam pics from greece, she probably pooped right before or after the pic. point is, dont get wrapped up in that. take a month or two break from social media and see how you feel. 3. you dont have to go to college. and you also dont have to not go if you dont know what to do with your life. youll figure it out, maybe get inspired by your classes. and, as long as it will not launch you into a huge debt, it is ok to major in something you might not end up getting a career in. (to an extent). college is more than career training. its a much bigger learning experience about. everything! people, the world, yourself. dont dig a debt, work very hard, have lots of fun, and try to keep your eyes on a career path, but also absorb everything like a sponge. 4. i hated when people told me, you wont even miss high school when youre older. i did, for a little bit. and now, i really dont. as important as it is as a state of your pre-adulthood, in the big scheme of things, its just a tiny chapter. so dont get hung up on the mistakes you made or the drama you had. appreciate the experience for what it gave you, and move on. 5. lastly, and where i go all old lady, please put your phone away in the car. even at stoplights. just wait until you arrive. you may be super used to it, but it only takes one second of inattention to become potentially fatal. someone just died in my neighborhood for this very reason. sending a snap. it can wait. 6. (edit to add #6) teach yourself personal finance basics. your school and maybe parents probably neglected this, if times havent changed all that much. but. the internet is wonderful! you can teach yourself. take an edx or kahn or itunesu course. learn the basics and start saving. really truly understand student loans before taking them. and save. saving sounds like something you have plenty of time for later. when you make more money. but tomorrow never comes. learn and save now.

2851	41759	9281	bqg2xi	eo4781k	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	cliques and high school mentality exist forever. some people just never grow up.
2852	41759	21491	bqg2xi	eo4ej81	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	to my former teenage self: when they say dont do drugs until your brain is fully developed, theres a reason, and you should listen. edit: thanks for the awards!
2853	41759	10604	bqg2xi	eo47gpr	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	a lot of people try to glamorize high school and make you think your high school years are the best years of your life. for a lot of people, this just isn't true. it's okay not to like high school or to feel like you don't belong. you are not alone. it gets better. high schoolers deal with a lot of heavy shit. a lot of mental illness comes to light at this age, including depression and anxiety but also heavier stuff. many who struggle with these issues won't get help until years later. high school kids also deal with a lot of issues, like identity issues, bullying, pressure to conform, disputes with parents, the pressure associated with juggling work, school and life that often get better once high school is done. hang in there, it does get better.
2854	41759	5920	bqg2xi	eo49ny3	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	that we miss you & we actually want to spend time with you, not because of how you were (our little boy/girl) but because we are in awe of who you are and want to get to know you better, so you know we love you unconditionally but also that its ok and fun to hang out sometimes; soon youll be leaving home, time passes quickly, and we want to create as many good memories as we can for you so you can use them for when the world is not so kind and im not around to give you a hug. youre amazing, youve always been and i know your life will be filled with ups and downs but i hope the love we share reminds you that youll always have a soft spot to land edit: note: thank you so much for your comments, i wish i could hug you all. thank you to those who granted me awards, i never thought an open letter to my son would move so many.i actually showed this to him, we both cried, hugged and laughed but most importantly and thanks to all of you i just became way cooler! im sorry for those of you who did not have a great upbringing, i didnt either, thats why youll be, just like me, especially careful with your kids emotional well-being, because after all, its their story in the making. edit 2: wow. dear reddit community, i want to share something with you: my son and i have read each one of your comments, i cannot express how this has been a deeply moving experience and that your words mean a lot to us. if you didnt have love and support growing up, i hear you, i do; its up to you now to give it, itll free you from the constrains of being hurt by the lacking. you dont have to be a parent, sometimes we choose our family, and love knows no titles, i have learned that by constantly feeling that love above all, hard moments and little (or big) grudges have the space to be felt and transform themselves into growing opportunities so we can, of course, love ourselves and others. my son sits here with me and we have had so many conversations because of your words, all of you are important in my book, youve made a huge difference today to this random family, irl.
2855	41759	13026	bqg2xi	eo45o1n	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	there are lots of paths to a successful happy life, not just the one that involves straight as and the ivy league or other top colleges.
2856	41759	552	bqg2xi	eo4i5bg	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	not a parent, but a teacher. once you're 11 or 12 years old, you need to take daily showers, change your shirt, socks and underwear and wear deodorant every day. i'm serious. there's always one or two in every class.
2857	41759	651	bqg2xi	eo4hbjg	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	procrastinating is like masturbating you are only fucking yourself
2858	41759	604	bqg2xi	eo4e4dh	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	be calm when arguing your point of view. accept criticism, shrug off the type of personal attacks and ad hominems that don't contribute to the debate. and don't measure how right you are by number of upvotes or downvotes.
2859	41759	22090	bqg2xi	eo48uev	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	just because you pop out a baby doesn't mean it'll keep your so around and at times it'll make them break up with you. to that part, just because you have the kid doesn't mean it'll unconditionally love you, especially when you're a shitty parent. these are things my idiotic friends had made when we were young, choosing to get knocked up at a wrong time in life has shaken lives to rubble at points.
2860	41759	8859	bqg2xi	eo48b59	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	build good health habits now. if you're not already active, find a simple active hobby you can do. take up pokemon go or take up bike riding or something. also, learn how to cook some basic and healthy meals like chicken pesto pasta or fried rice. the healthier you are as a teen the easier it is to stay healthy as an adult. edit: my food options seem super controversial, like portion control and different recipes aren't a thing. but here's a recipe that's super simple, fairly healthy, takes about 5-10 minutes and anyone can do. buy some bagged lettuce, or like 2-3 different kinds of lettuce if you can get the fresh stuff. take a cucumber grab some olives or carrots or whatever else you like. snag some feta cheese. fry up a small amount of minced turkey (i get that everyone hates fried food, but again, proportions are key). put lettuce in bowl, slice up as much cucumber as you want, add that to bowl, cut up carrots, add to bowl, same with olives and extra veggies. put in the small amount of turkey (like 100g is enough) and crumble a small amount of feta on top (feta has a strong flavor so you always need less than you think you do). it makes a really delicious salad that fills you up for hours. turkey is also naturally flavorful when fried like that so you can add spices or not and it's still fine.
2861	41759	12673	bqg2xi	eo47127	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	1) work on improving yourself and your interests now, it will set you up for more success later and likely will attract others to you.2) none of social-structure/drama shit is going to matter once you're out of school so don't worry about what others think, you just do you. 3) . . its completely legal for a teenager to buy all the equipment and ingredients to make beer, just saying.
2862	41759	440	bqg2xi	eo4ctdy	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	go ahead and be rebellious, it's part of growing up. but please be safe while you are doing it! use the condom, don't depend on your date for transportation until you know them, tell someone where you are so we know how to get to you in an emergency, keep your phone charged, ask for help if needed.
2863	41759	2956	bqg2xi	eo46hz2	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	don't smoke, do heroin, or get arrested.
2864	41759	14668	bqg2xi	eo43fk9	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	as an older teen talking to my younger teen self: have some patience you fuck
2865	41759	1250	bqg2xi	eo464e4	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	**it's okay to not have a plan yet.** *edit, to clarify, i think you should have at least loose goals, something (anything) you're working toward, otherwise you'll go nowhere. but the plan to get there doesn't have to be well thought out yet, you definitely don't have to have to know all the details at this point, and you certainly shouldn't beat yourself up or stress out. **edit: thanks to /u/drgrabass for making me make this at least moderately more useful advice.
2866	41759	600	bqg2xi	eo46raa	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	right now you have options, figure out what you want, every bill you get, every responsibility you add to you life takes away options. eventually people have all these bills and kids and marriages or whatever, but its all responsibilitys that you are going to have. it might take a few years to figure out , no big deal. just dont go buy that new car because you want to be cool, you just took away a little bit of freedom. live free now, you have very few responsibilities. do all the crazy dumb shit, fail at business. we need more entrepreneurs, do it and fail now. because when your 30 with a family and career and you didnt take that chance when you were a teen (early 20s) it will dig at you every day.
2867	41759	1869	bqg2xi	eo46gst	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"when i was teenager i was going through a really rough patch where i felt i might have depression. i didn't know who to talk to, so i thought i'd ask my doctor about it. i told him i thought i might be depressed and asked if he had any suggestions on what to do. he laughed at me and said, ""you're not depressed, you're just a teenager."" i never went back to that doctor again, but i also didn't open up to anyone about the way i felt again. i went though a really self-destructive peoriod following that using drugs, alcohol, and self-harm to cope and about to flunk out my school, which was one of the best private schools in the city. i was at a real low point and one night when i was set on killing myself, my dog snoopy convinced me not to and made me want to try and get better. i finally decided to try and get some help again and after i did i wished i had done it sooner. my point is don't be afraid to ask others for help. wanting to better your mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, even if it might feel that way."
2868	41759	982	bqg2xi	eo48se5	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	calm down. you don't need to know what you want to do with the rest of your life right now. take your time and look at many different avenues
2869	41759	339	bqg2xi	eo4abtl	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	don't emulate celebrity and 'influencers'. be your own person.
2870	41759	89	bqg2xi	eo4ak27	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	not a parent but losing friends for sticking up for yourself is so much better than staying with them while they inject their toxicity into you and lead you down a very bad path (or constantly making you feel like absolute shit) and is actually a great fucking thing and youll thank yourself for it later on in life trust me
2871	41759	419	bqg2xi	eo49rwn	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	gain more life experience before considering children.(or even chancing it for that matter.) having a child when you're too young or inexperienced robs the baby of much needed stability and direction. an education, halfway decent job and a general understanding of life is highly recommend. source: became a father at a young age, no formal education, had a 17k/year job(at the time) and was in an otherwise unhappy relationship with the mother. note: she wasn't planned nor is she regretted, she forced me to grow tf up, step out of my comfort zone and land an actual job that can pay the bills.
2872	41759	518	bqg2xi	eo4dtf3	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	wear sunscreen. im not a parent but im 24 and ive always worn sunscreen, and its crazy how my friends the same age who didnt wear all have wrinkles already and look much older than they are
2873	41759	509	bqg2xi	eo4bv9o	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	not a parent but what i realized with age. nobody gives a fuck about you. yes thats a good thing. when youre out of school all that social bullshit will become irrelevant because thats not how people interact, and you realize how little it mattered.
2874	41759	219	bqg2xi	eo4hnzg	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	if you want to go to college, see about getting it done with just as little debt as possible. two years in community college is a good if not ideal start.

2877	41759	425	bqg2xi	eo4a2ey	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	as a mom, and a former teen, sometimes life just sucks, and it feels like it will never get better, but often times the suckiness is temporary. it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but maybe there is a bend in the path that is keeping the light from you. keep going till you get some agency and can make your own decisions and choices for what your life looks like. when i was 14 i really wanted to die. i was bullied and i felt unimportant in my family. i was ready to commit suicide, but i somehow talked myself into waiting until i was an adult. thank goodness i waited, life has been 1000% better and different from how i expected. i still occasionally get twinges of depression, but i get through in increments of 15 minutes at a time. you have value. you are worthy. you are loved.

2880	41759	53	bqg2xi	eo4u4vz	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	i was paranoid that everyone was judging me, manipulating my every decision and was trying to listen to my thoughts. &#x200b; boy i was wrong, nobody gives a flying fuck about you.

2883	41759	41	bqg2xi	eo4e2m9	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	it's perfectly normal to be shit at something the first time you try it. no-one is an expert at something without having put in the effort, time and patience, despite what you might believe from social media. also, those pictures you see of gorgeous people. they're all airbrushed and contrived (the pic, not always the person).

(and that means for the rest of your life. don't get face tats just because you got lead bagger at safeway unless you want to retire as lead bagger.)

"don't allow the internet to make you miss the ""human experience"". use the internet to enhance your ""real"" life, don't use it to escape from it. you are part of a generation that is likely to have an online friend before even have a ""real life"" friend. it's ok to have online friends, but to have only online friends and not have actual friends you can touch and see face to face, that's what i call ""missing the human experience"". there is nothing like face to face interaction. yes porn is awesome, but can you compare it to a real girlfriend? internet can be addictive, like any drug if you manage it well it can actually improve life, but too much of it could make you have no life. there are already the firsts rehab centers for online addiction."

2897	41759	67	bqg2xi	eo4qc4t	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	disclaimer: not a parent. * don't smoke cigarettes. holy shit, i started at 15 and couldn't come to a full stop until i was 24. it might take some stress off or seem like a really easy way to socialize with people, but it's just a crutch. * use moderation in everything; don't get mixed up in addictive substances. there is absolutely such a thing as a psychological addition to substances that aren't physically addictive. just because weed won't kill you and doesn't create physical addiction, doesn't mean you can't become psychologically addicted to it. what do you think is the hardest part about quitting cigarettes? from my experience, most addicts will tell you that it's the routine. same thing applies to pot. if you're going to smoke pot, use moderation. is what you're considering taking physically addictive? pull your shit together and don't get involved in it. * fuck who you want (you know, with mutual consent and all), but use condoms. use condoms. use condoms you daft shit. * she/you is/are on birth control? congrats, use a condom. 100% of post-nut clarity will tell you that you're not at a time in your life to even risk having kids. * he/she's totally clean? definitely use a condom. guess what? they tell everyone they're clean, which means they're not using condoms with other people and probably have no fucking idea whether they're actually clean. the only exception to this should be long-term relationships after extremely careful consideration by both you and your partner. still, ymmv. be warned. * also, condoms don't fully protect against herpes. * actually pay attention in class. i spent so much time dicking around and looking for ways to burn time before the bell; i missed out on so much as a result. i'll never give a fuck about the memes i was browsing in my dc calculus class, but i definitely gave a fuck when i was in college level calculus classes and didn't remember the subject foundations that i should have established earlier on. additionally, paying attention is just a good habit. you might not give a fuck about the subject, but high school is most important in teaching you *how* to learn complex(ish) topics. it's a skill that you'll need no matter where you go in life. * don't make life decisions based on your high school paramore. for fucks sake, neither of your brains have fully developed. neither of you have any idea how the other will turn out in two, five, or ten years. i went from being some burnout stoner in the bottom third of my high school class to a law student who graduated with honors and an academic publication. some of the smartest people i knew fell off the deep end and never left their parents' houses, despite having every opportunity in the world to do so. * learn how to cut out the toxic people in your life. it might take time and patience, and a little finesse, but it's a thing i wish i'd learned to do before my early-mid twenties. you'll be a hundred times happier for it. * if you go to college, major in something marketable. minor in whatever the fuck you enjoy. don't flush 100k down the drain for an art history degree. * on that note, if you're planning on going to college, start applying for scholarships early. even if you're extremely fortunate and your family is covering your tuition, start applying for scholarships. student loans may seem like some distant problem, but you'll curse the ever loving fuck out of your past (current) self if you don't start taking some steps to mitigate needing loans. * if your family is covering your tuition through a 529 plan, whatever is leftover goes to you at the end of college. build a huge cushion with scholarships and be ahead of the curve in savings when you graduate. * finally, you're about to learn that time flies. you think you know now? it gets worse. it feels like last month that i left home to start college. that was seven years ago. enjoy every day. enjoy living with your parents and having stupid rules to follow. enjoy riding your crappy bike and working at that crappy pizza joint. enjoy that boring day with your friends where you're all sitting around with no idea what to do. one day, that's all going to go away. it's all going to be a memory as you shuffle through the increasingly complex and challenging world of adulthood. make no mistake, it's still exciting and you'll have more memories to make, but the ones you make today? make them fond.
2898	41759	43	bqg2xi	eo4lz7p	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	we love you and are so proud of you. we watch you when you think we're not looking and are in awe of every inch of you. you used to fit so perfectly in our arms, and we knew how to keep you safe. we put you down for only a second, and when we picked you up again, you had learned to crawl. we put you down once more, and in the blink of an eye, you had learned how to walk. there was now an urgency and rush in your exploration of the world. you wanted to absorb everything, and we reluctantly had to start letting you go. your first act of defiance was growing without permission, and before we were ready. the only new role we had to adjust to was becoming parents; we tried to figure it out as we went along. mistakes were made. many. and sometimes, more than once. it's not an excuse, just a fact. but it was harder for you, because you had so many roles you were expected to step into: son/daughter, brother/sister, grandchild, student, extracurricular sports. the entire list must be overwhelming. what we should tell you is that even in failure, you will never do wrong. we fell for you. we fell hard. we adore and worship every strand of hair on you, regardless what colour of hair you're experimenting with; every millimeter of skin; every heartbeat. subconsciously, and silently, we do want you to strive for perfection, because that's what the world is going to expect from you. narcissistically, we believe that your failures and succeses will be a reflection of our parenting. we ride you hard sometimes, because that seems to be what we're supposed to do. but the truth is that we're partly scared. we know we will have to leave you some day. we hate the thought of you being alone in this world, because we know, have seen and experienced some of the terrible parts of life and others. we haven't really done that great of a job in running the world, and the legacy you'll inherit will be terrifying some times. all we can do is try to prepare you to be able to supercede us and our accomplishments. we want you to do, and be better than us. we need you to do and be better than us. we know it's a huge burden. forgive us. we love you, and are so proud of you xx
2899	41759	38	bqg2xi	eo4qrey	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"learn the art of conversation. before you are an adult embarrassing yourself in front of smart, considerate adults conversation skills include: 1. stop with the constant ""facts"". unless what you are quoting is a paper with cited sources and you are talking with other experts in said field. otherwise you come off as a fake know it all who knows nothing but what they read on the internet. people see through that shit and it's annoying to say the least. 2. it is not a conversation if you are not asking questions. it's just you talking and holding another hostage. also, they aren't listening 3. take time to think about what is being said by someone other than you. waiting for your turn to talk is also not a conversation 4. interrupting. it's okay to be excited and some people's conversation is more interrupty than other's, but be mindful 5. know your audience. conversation can quickly turn into arguing. so if it's conversation you're going for, read the crowd and avoid escalation to sum it up don't be a dick"
2900	41759	74	bqg2xi	eo49c4e	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	enjoy not paying bills because soon they will come, god they will come
2901	41759	52	bqg2xi	eo4dvnv	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	open a savings account, contribute weekly/monthly to it. do not touch it. save whatever you can, whenever you can.
2902	41759	52	bqg2xi	eo4hvkx	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	you're not imagining it -- being a teenager is really f***ing hard, and a lot of adults forget that. but that does not give you an excuse to be such a little sh*t
2903	41759	16	bqg2xi	eo4f304	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"independence is a natural and desirable outcome of growing up. my job as a parent in my opinion is in large part to make my daughters gradually more independent so that by the time they leave the nest they can take care of themselves. you don't have to ""rebel"" to achieve this, unless your parents are stalling your normal development. as an aside i don't really get helicopter or smothering parents who micromanage their kids. things are far easier when kids can take care of themselves, less work for the parent and also in the long run its far better for the kid. them taking care of themselves and making there own decisions is kind of the idea behind raising them in the first place, so i don't really get overbearing parents who drive themselves and often their kids nuts with all that nervous controlling energy."
2904	41759	46	bqg2xi	eo4ff7l	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	you guys are awesome. ive been in education for 24 years and overall, teenagers today are so much more accepting, affirming, and supportive than theyve ever been. im so proud of how you guys stick up for kids with disabilities, kids who are different, or just the underdog. your generation gets so much undeserved crap, but you just keep on being great.
2905	41759	49	bqg2xi	eo4gx78	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	don't be afraid to approach and talk to someone you find attractive. they're most likely just as shy as you. it's also a numbers game. the more you put yourself out there, the more you'll get comfortable and great at starting small talk (which is also helpful later during job interviews) leading to more dates. or hook-ups ;) one last thing, fake confidence works. you may be dying on the inside but keep your poker face and no one will ever know!!
