913	51954	11123	bniexw	en6cctq	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	okay, it wasn't a bathroom floor, it was the floor of a laundromat at an apartment complex (at which i lived). i was 12 and got home after walking from school. but dad hadn't gotten home yet so i was locked out of the apartment. for the record, as a kid i didn't shit at school. couldn't. so now i didn't know what to do, but i knew the shit was coming. i tried holding it in i promise. i moved around, tried occupying my mind with other things, tried running. next thing i know i'm in the corner of the laundromat shitting on the floor. god i'm so ashamed to admit this even 15 years later. i have nightmares about the cleaning staff or the unlucky tenant just trying to get their clothes out of the dryer and coming upon a steaming hot shit right the fuck there. i try to convince myself that they all must've thought it was a dog, but i remember. that shit was distinctly human. it haunts my soul.
914	51954	8679	bniexw	en6f8ap	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	on my first deployment, someone took a massive shit in one of the toilets and covered it with an entire roll of toilet paper and it stayed like that for days. then, someone shit on top of that first layer and covered it with another huge wad of toilet paper. about two weeks later someone added another layer of shit and toilet paper, effectively creating a shit lasagna. eventually it all disappeared, im not sure how but i just know one day it was gone and the madness was finally over.
915	51954	10729	bniexw	en69h9l	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	a few months ago i actually walked in on this person literally taking a shit on the floor we were the only ones in there it was a couple of hours after school had ended. i really didn't know what to do and was still for a few seconds before she started frantically talking and said something about it being an act of defiance or something and was saying she hated the school. i kinda just laughed it off for a second before leaving and going to another bathroom. i didn't say anything to a teacher because i think she was a 9th or 10th grader and i don't know her name. definitely an interesting part of my education
916	51954	9006	bniexw	en605ow	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	in our high school the refried beans literally looked like poop so i once put it on the bathroom floor as a joke. it resulted in many many angry facebook posts.
917	51954	19785	bniexw	en68499	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	there is a mystery suspect making a mess of the bathrooms at my business right now (not a school, grown ups(ish) work here). throwing used toilet paper on the ground, pissing all over, wiping poop on the toilet paper dispenser. they go to the bathroom with no cameras outside, but despite that i've still narrowed it down to one of about 12 people. i'll catch you eventually.
918	51954	14694	bniexw	en65jhw	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	you think this is limited to high school? i've heard horror stories from my friends who work in nice, professional offices where people poop on the floor and smear it all over the stalls.
919	51954	715	bniexw	en6692j	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	climbing on top of the stalls to play bombardier, sometimes we missed
920	51954	318	bniexw	en6cdfl	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"i can answer this question. one of my brother's friends pooped on the floor of the bathroom while my brother and his other friends were outside the stall. apparently the guy sat down on the seat like normal, but with his left asscheek on the right side of the toilet seat. he said when he saw the poop hit the floor it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. later on one of the janitors was heard saying ""i just can't believe it. i don't know how it happened."""
921	51954	13315	bniexw	en64pnp	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	my chemistry teacher told us a story about a student who im positive was an old god of lore. he took a shit in a cabinet of the most hated teacher in a high school of 3,000 students, and that old cunt let it sit there for weeks. it hardened to the cabinet, and the only reason it got taken care of was because a student/someone reported the horrible smell. why? because she told him he couldnt go to the bathroom, no reason given.
922	51954	1994	bniexw	en6663c	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"it wasnt in high school but when i was a young kid out public library was the spot to go to meet up other kids to walk around town. the security guard was a notorious asshole who would make groups of over 3 kids leave because of ""gang activity."" after a few months of this going on a few of the groups of kids would shit on the floor in the bathroom knowing he was the one that had to clean it. he didnt work there much longer."
923	51954	10941	bniexw	en665j6	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	so this is slightly off topic but relevant none the less. when i was young i went to after school care at a local rec center. one day i was there and went to use the bathroom. i was taking a leak at a urinal and i kept smelling shit and i figured someone had just took a huge dump recently and thats what i was smelling. so i finished up peeing and getting ready to go wash my hands and just happened to peek at the ceiling. im sure at this point you understand where this is going, but directly above where i was peeing, there was a turd stuck to the ceiling.
924	51954	9355	bniexw	en6brpi	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"sophomore year of highschool a bunch of friends and i were drinking at this dude's house (we'll call him greg). this was our first time drinking more or less and we were just chilling, having few drinks. we were playing gta and greg walks into the bathroom, comes out a few minutes later, and sits down. soon someone else goes into the bathroom comes back and asks, almost like he's trying not to laugh, ""did someone take a shit on the floor?"" we all get up to investigate and sure enough, there it was. a big, slunking turd presented to us in the center of the cool linoleum like it was on a silver fucking platter. we laughed ourselves to tears, looked up, and saw greg sitting there. he is trying his absolute best to not start laughing but this is the funniest shit he's ever seen. i ask him between my laughs, ""did you shit on your own bathroom floor???"" to which he replies, ""yeah! i dont know, i thought it would be pretty funny!"""
925	51954	17908	bniexw	en67sa3	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	for the same reason people knock over a garbage can or plug up the sink: it's a small act of anti-social behavior. i worked in a movie theater as a teen. right in the middle of the bathroom floor someone dropped one of the largest turds i've ever seen. the main log was incredibly dry and about the width of a pringles can. i still debate to this day whether the poor bastard shat that out real time, or multi-shat in an actual pringles can and then dumped it on the floor. given the size of the log, the time it would take any normal person to squeeze such a massive grogan out, and the absence of blood, i'm leaning toward the pringles can theory. edit: thanks for the awards and opiate poop education everyone!
926	51954	8780	bniexw	en6gdt9	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	im using one of my throwaways for obvious reasons, i doubt anyone will read this at this point but its quite personal. im in therapy for a lot of things right now and something ive researched a bit about is something that i did as a child thats about the same what op asked. i moved a lot as a child, i wasnt at the same school two years in a row until 8th grade. in the earlier elementary years i used to smear my poops on the walls of the stalls. i remember it feeling out of body to me, like it wasnt me that decided to do it, it just happened. ive learned pretty recently that its likely due to sexual abuse in my very early years. its something like not feeling in control of your own body so youre taking control of something. its something that you make, that your body makes, and this is really all there is to do with it besides flushing it. i didnt do it every time i pooped but until like 5th grade i caught my poop on some toilet paper just to see how much it weighed. i never touched it to my skin or smelled it or tasted it. it was more of a catch and release sort of thing. and sometimes i would smear it. were going to do emdr in therapy about it soon to see if thats the source of a lot of my deep shame feelings. if anyone here has read this far, if you catch a child doing this or hear of someone that got caught doing it, keep an eye out for them. be an ally by (at the very least) being kind to them and deterring further abuses on the playground. help the rumor die if you can or just dont spread it. that may be a child in need of the most dire kind of help. edit: spelling and missed words. edit a bit more: this has been a very unexpected show of support and i thank everyone of you who have commented or pmd me. i hope your awareness and learning helps us collectively and individually end the various cycles of abuse that plague our planet. im nothing near a professional on these matters, just have found myself in a point in my life where ive been able to focus on my inner self and helping it heal from shadowy images ive unknowingly held in my head since i was very small. having said that, please feel free to reach out to me via pm if youd like to talk. this is a throwaway for me so i feel quite comfortable being very honest. seriously, thank you all so much for the awards too, didnt even know we had a platinum one.
927	51954	111	bniexw	en6cfp3	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	reminds me of this kid from middleschool who kept shitting on this teacher's driveway. she was widely disliked, she liked to get in students faces and berate them because she knows that she spits her stanky tooth rot spit on your face while she yells at you. she liked to hand out detention over the smallest things, just on a power trip. anyway this kid finds out where she lives and shits on her driveway. a group of kids hear and don't believe him so he does it again with them present, except this time he shits on her doorstep and ding dong ditches. this gets repeated for weeks because whenever someone hears about it they dont believe it and he was all too happy to repeat it for you.
928	51954	1171	bniexw	en67c9k	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	there was a tradition in my college freshman dorm that someone(s) would shit in the hallway trashcans on move-out day, supposedly to get the freshman out faster. i suspected it was our ra, but ugh what a way to end a year
929	51954	980	bniexw	en66yzt	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i had a kid at my school draw in his own feces. he was a little disturbed, but not in asd group or anything. only reason someone found out was because he went back to class and wiped his hands all over the whiteboard, which was pretty vile.
930	51954	24526	bniexw	en64alr	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	someone just destroyed a bathroom at my middle school i work at. it doesn't punish the school, a teacher or a principal. it punishes the custodians, who happen to be some of the nicest people you will ever meet.
931	51954	106	bniexw	en6a9ov	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	explosive diarrhea is real. i only had it 1 time. i don't know what i ate but it got everywhere and just kept coming and coming. falling out wherever you may be. it hurt. like a canon. pop pop boom. i don't know why it happened. but it happened and i was horrified and ran. but now for the people who get it even on the ceiling.
932	51954	1429	bniexw	en6ah65	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"god, i hate to answer this question. not highschool, but middle school. i swear it was an accident. tl;dr - i had 3 days of shit piled up in my colon at the end of the school day, and miscalculated the proximity of my buttcheeks to the toilet, resulting in me shitting directly infront of a toilet. ok, so, there i was in computer class. we're on mavis or whatever that thing was that teaches you how to type efficiently. computer was our last class of the day, then we could go home. well, that morning, i was just not feeling well. i was the typical faker, and would say ""i'm not feeling well"" to my parents time and time again and pray they wouldn't take me to school. but i felt like shit. dunno why, or what caused it, but i was genuinely sick to my stomach and felt like barfing all day long. so, my parents tell me to use the restroom, maybe i'll feel better afterwards. i went, and nothing came out, mostly due to me being a little anxious at the time. i'm anally-retentive, meaning i pucker my anus as much as i can and refuse to poop anywhere that isn't my toilet at home, partly because anxiety, partly due to me being a mild clean freak. this makes long car rides and airplane travel extremely difficult, and requires me to eat very little before travelling. anyway, i digress. so, around lunchtime, i decided to have some pizza. pizza day happens once a week, and it's 50c a slice, so i was like, why not? i'll gorge a little. after lunch comes p.e., which i resented so much. who designed our schedule to allow a bunch of full, sweaty kids to eat and then right after, play some football? always pissed me off the way our schedule was set up. anyway, come p.e., and i'm like, waddling as to not shit myself. i had an opportunity to go use the restroom, but the restrooms were nasty, because sweaty boys + the pizza shits = a disgusting aftermath. i went to the restroom, saw the stunned remains of an absolute unit of a turd, which the toilet did not fully eradicate. went to another stall, just as disgusting as the first. third was less nasty, but there was something on the toilet seat (liquid, not solid) and just decided to wait til i got home to release the build-up of at least 3 days worth of shit. i should've taken my opportunity with stall number three. oh, how i regret that decision. math and history went off fine, in between those classes and my last class was a break, in which time i decided was a great time to get a snack and a can of coke. consumed both quickly and headed upstairs for computer. i sat down, and immediately the urge hit me. i waited. and waited. and waited. class started, and we were to do our assignments. we were allowed to do them unmonitered, as she was super lax and didn't care - we could literally cheat and she wouldn't care. i was naturally good at typing (thanks to runescape) and finished my assignments. i immediately darted out the class without asking to use the restroom, or with the bathroom pass, which was a big no-no in my school. i had a detention waiting for me when i got back, but i didn't care. i was just seconds away from my shit providing enough thrust to launch me to the stratosphere. i went to the bathroom, and wouldn't you know it, all the stalls are full. so, i did the only reasonable thing i could do. i went to the girls restroom. i then second-guessed that thought. so now, i was torn. do i wait? do i go down the stairs and risk shitting my way to the moon? do i risk getting caught by a girl in the girls room? i made a decision to go downstairs, and i could feel it nearly poking out my sphincter. so i ran into the restroom, pulled my pants off and placed them on my bag (i like to poop naked, sue me) and before i sat, i looked. it was the grossest stall of all time. *someone didnt flush! red alert, red alert!* my little 12 year old brain could not stand the thought of my shit touching someone elses shit, and risking the possibility of the shit splashing back onto my ass. so, i squatted above the toilet seat, and released. my calculations were so exact, that with the force i exerted on my sphincter, and the proximity of my asshole to the toilet, that i thought the shit was gonna land square in the hole, and all would be said and done. my calculations were off. by a lot. i was a good couple inches from being anywhere close to the toilet. so i shat *right infront of the toilet* i went into panick mode. i flipped out; do i clean it up? do i let leguizama (the schools janitor) clean it up? am i gonna get a detention for this? or worse, a saturday school??? so, i wiped, put the tp in the toilet, and didn't even flush. i washed and walked out, obviously panicked. i was so self concious and anxious at the time, that i sprayed myself down with the choicest body spray around, axe body spray, to mask the smell of shit that i know would linger around until i showered. i walked out of that stall anxious as could be, and got a drink of water, and went back to class. the next day, an announcement was made before the pledge of allegiance, stating that there was a dookie dropped in front of the toilet, and not in the toilet in the bathroom across the computer lab. for some reason, i felt proud of myself. i wasn't caught, and i'm sure mr. leguizama was the one who cleaned it up."
933	51954	3375	bniexw	en5yg96	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	this question needs upvotes. i honestly need to know what is going through the minds of these individuals.
934	51954	2158	bniexw	en6749k	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	problem with questions like these is everyone is gonna be pissed off at anyone who answers truthfully
935	51954	573	bniexw	en66xe4	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not entirely related, but we once had a rebellious kid smeared vegemite across the walls of the bathroom. the vp had all the male students assembled in the hall and he yelled at us for about ten minutes about how there was faeces on the bathroom wall and how the cleaner had to suffer cleaning it up. needless to say it did not take long for word to get around that it was indeed vegemite.
936	51954	756	bniexw	en60l68	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	malice. sheer, relentless, unadulterated malice.
937	51954	267	bniexw	en66icg	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i saw someone did this on my schools bathroom floor and all i though is what horrible person would do this knowing a janitor would have to clean it up. also my schools janitors are the nicest people so highly doubt it was someone doing it to get back at them.
938	51954	872	bniexw	en67v56	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i was in high school (maybe middle school) but we were in a local park in my hometown where we always hung out and played games, airsoft, and other random stuff. i had to take a shit real bad one day and i couldn't make the 3 block or so run to my grandparents house so i sucked it up and ran into the park bathroom. i had a massive turd 90% of the way out of my ass when i realized there was no toilet paper anywhere to be found. so i shifted a bit and dropped that large turd right there on the cement floor. i haven't really thought about it since then, and now that the memory came back to me a decade later thanks to this question, i immediately regret it all edit: sorry 14 year old me didnt think logically and not shit on the floor. if you think what you have to comment wouldnt persuaded me either way then idk, prayers your way. clearly this wasnt my peak so lay off, you buttholes
939	51954	699	bniexw	en5x5g7	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	the toilet. it was just to far away.

941	51954	236	bniexw	en6b9bl	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	my time to shine: my junior year of high school boyfriend, shat on my driveway and flipped an empty flower pot upside down and left it under there. i discovered this when him and his dumb friends dropped me off, laughing and asked me what was under the flower pot. cue me, oblivious and naive, lifting the flower pot in horror, stunned as they laughed at me looking at literal human shit. cool way to break up with a girl. /s
942	51954	142	bniexw	en69zdb	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	or not just school but public places, heck even some adults do this! one time i was at the cash at walmart and just noticed the bathroom was fenced off and marked as out of order, didn't really think much of it but over heard a staff conversation from the other cash and someone basically blasted the entire bathroom with poop, floors, walls, and ceilings. how and why do people do this? walmart employees don't get paid enough to deal with that. i would hope that they brought in a special abatement team for that.
943	51954	436	bniexw	en67ehj	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i once took an insane amount of cough syrup during my high school philosophy class. the teacher decided to show a movie that day, fuckin great right? nope. 20 minutes in i got the strongest urge to just throw up everywhere. i didnt even ask the teacher to step out i just straight up left and rushed towards the bathroom. i remember throwing up at the very entrance to the bathroom leaving a trail of puke leading towards the toilet where i proceeded to regurgitate half my body weight. fun times at coral park.
944	51954	211	bniexw	en69y0i	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i had a friend who pooped on the sink of the school bathroom because he needed to shit real bad and all the cubicles were occupied.
945	51954	50	bniexw	en6crhi	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	once i was at a hospital where my dad was admitted after a heart attack. my sister and i, both adults at this point, stayed overnight. i had to pee super super bad and went to the bathroom like a normal person does for such and the lone toilet in the room was just like the toilets of my nightmares when i have to pee really bad and am having a dream of needing a toilet you know? full of blood, poop, tampons even maybe some pads idk i almost lurched anyway my need to pee wasnt going anywhere so feeling like i have zero choice - i had been looking for awhile for a bathroom that didnt say patients only for a good twenty minutes and it was like 3 in the morning i had drank lots of caffeine anywho there i go and pee on the floor. i find my way back to our little designated icu lounge we had kind of a private area with all the possible amenities of a hospital you could imagine decent ish lounge chairs, pillows, blankets, free soda and snacks all you could need with the exception of working restrooms. now, there were restrooms there in that utopia of a hospital waiting area but they both had closed for cleaning signs and had them for awhile. i feel like maybe they just put them on at night so not to be bothered with them and it seemed in all the little private family lounge areas all was quite except for ours and i guess maybe because the heart attack had just happened that day with an emergency surgery the adrenaline of the day made it to where we just couldnt sleep. so after doing my dirty business in the dirty bathroom i return and my sister is gone. now this is about 2004 or so, we had cellphones but i dont think we had texting or if we did it was limited and yada yada so im clueless as to where she was but unconcerned i had been missing awhile i assume she goes to look for me- we had some sort of device that the nurses station let us know if there was an issue with my dad so i settle back in and she returns to tell me the exact same story i had about a disgusting bathroom that she pees on the floor of because she sees no alternative. now were not sure at this point if its the same bathroom because we had both wandered aimlessly to find it. the hospital is big and all we both knew is that it we didnt leave the cardiac area- we were both scared of getting lost (in hindsight why we didnt just go together is beyond me). at any rate she said the floor had been wet but with the toilet i saw being overflowed and nasty we still didnt know. the day had been awful and my dad went from most likely being dead to most likely being okay by midnight that night we had been through it and suddenly nothing was more important to us than knowing if we golden showered the same bathroom so we went to find it. we stumble upon the place that, sure enough, we both had used only to see another woman stumble out, shell shocked, and advising us to find another toilet. fifteen years later we still talk about it.
946	51954	203	bniexw	en670hw	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	someone shit in the middle of the hall at my school once
947	51954	89	bniexw	en66xy8	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	was always a treat to walk into a bathroom with urinals full of poop
948	51954	87	bniexw	en69afh	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not the bathroom floor but on the last day of school back in grade 11, someone took a massive diarrhea-shit in one of the stairwells. it was all over the stairs; not sure if someone stepped in it or the pooper dropped his load while going down the stairs. edit: there were also frequent urinal dukes throughout that year. pretty sure my high school just had some crazed diarrhea-fiend that year.
949	51954	40	bniexw	en6hatb	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	so best story ever. my first day of grade 1 elementary school. we get just a basic tour of the school facilities and we don't really do any real work. we're in the gym class getting a rundown of gym. we do some fun activities. suddenly i gotta go. bad. i ask the teacher to let me shit. he's like yeah. he knows what's up. i go into the bathroom he pointed out. i look inside. no toilets. all i see if these big tall metal structures with faucets at the top of them. drains in the bottom. wtf is this shit? so i keep looking and looking and no toilets and i really gotta go. so i just go into the thing and then pull my pants up and walk out like normal. later that day the principal comes on the intercom announcement and is furious!! he vows to find who shit in the showers. anyway as far as i know he never found out it was me.
950	51954	78	bniexw	en6c19u	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not pooping on the bathroom floor in high school, but maybe related. once i was going to sleep on the couch at a friends house after a night of drinking out. we were all about 23 at the time. im just about to drift to sleep when i see a female figure, in the dark, walk into the living room, back up to a corner, drop trou, and start pissing on the hardwood floor. im all like, wut. am i really witnessing this? come to find out they suspected this roommate of doing this on a regular basis but never had proof. i guess she didnt know i was in the room at the time. her excuse was a shrug, and an indication it gave her some jollies. people are weird.
951	51954	68	bniexw	en67v1l	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	freshman year there was a kid who would shit in sinks all over the school. we assumed it was a guy until it started happening in the girls bathrooms. for weeks this person was the talk of the school. billy seen one in the gym bathroom, brenda found it 3rd floor senior hall. this person was a legend. nobody ever found out who the sink squatter was.i just felt bad for the janitor.

954	51954	65	bniexw	en6a1wc	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we had a fecal phantom at my high school. so perplexing and horrifying
955	51954	64	bniexw	en6eqiw	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	finally, some shit i can answer so last spring, i was doing snow day outings as a counselor on an outdoor resort. someone thought it would be a great idea to send 7 year olds to a sleepover outing that week, and i can attest that it was the worst fucking idea anyone has had in the last 2 years. first off, breakfast is served at 8am, so i usually wake the kids up at 7 45 so they can get dressed. not that group. no, that group decided they should wake up at 5 30 am and play hide and seek (and hide under my bed, pulling my sheets for additional cover). ''but random guy on reddit, what does any of that have to do with shitting on the floor??'' you ask. im getting to it so, as im trying to ignore the hide and seek and lie to myself thinking i'll just go back to sleep, i hear '' eeeeeeeeew raj (fictional name) peed in the trashcan!!!'' i get up (very begrudgingly) to go and confirm this event, and sure enough, the wastepaper basket was half full of pee. you see, our poor raj was suspected (yet still undiagnosed) to suffer from autism, and had trouble with social behaviors and how to act with others. he explained that while playing hide and seek, he was confronted with a choice either leave his hiding spot and go to the washroom, or stay hidden, pee in the adjacent trash can, and maybe win. and raj ain't no fucking loser.

959	51954	24	bniexw	en6c807	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we had a group of 3 vending machines right near the gym in case visitors wanted a snack and we didn't have a snack table set up, but mostly we would walk over there to take a break to talk or whatever and grab a couple snacks for class. my buddy dropped a deuce next to it because his special talent was pooping in random places, or as he called himself a pirp. that was his freshman year. senior year rolls around and they wanted to do a senior prank related to that. he went to the stalls in the gym bathroom and removed the dividers and brought them out and set them on the ground in front of the vending machines. he then printed a picture of poop out and taped it to the ground and had some whitty caption to go with it.

"so this kid at my highschool took a fat dump under the stairs as a senior prank and eevverryyybody knew who it was but he never got caught because the school had no way to prove it. soon after that he went to prison for 10 years on a serious drug bust as soon as got out of prison he updated his fb page for the first time in a decade ""hey guys i was the one who took a shit under the stairs"" fucking legend."
961	51954	41	bniexw	en6gi33	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	classmates paid the local class idiot to poop in the laptop of the class administrator. i hated the idiot, but hated the administrator more so i chipped in. he slipped into his office as a bunch of kids pretended to start a fight that he needed to intervene in. he took the laptop, opened it like a book and held it under his ass and dropped the bomb. **then he closed it up with the turd in it.** to this day i have hysterical laughing fits at the idea of that shit getting squeezed between the keys. no loud or otherwise angry reaction though. he just locked his office knowing he can't let the kids see him because that's what they wanted. but we knew better, and that was good enough.

963	51954	127	bniexw	en67588	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"this used to happen at my highschool (i didn't personally do it). it was pretty funny until you stepped in it. on top of this, they - rub their ass on a fork and put it back into dispensers, take a tiny piece of crap and pass it around the class calling it a ""scratch 'n' sniff"" (i have images of one we made in class, a fake one made out of melted m&ms in chemistry. this one i was a part of but its whatever. we added toilet paper to it and it looked so real and disgusting, but smelled awfully good. the other scratch and sniffs were sadly real). shit in the urinals and the sinks break the sinks off the walls, amongst other things. moon people in class (theyve mooned the teachers before), flash their balls to the girls, and surprisingly never got in trouble. say all sorts of things that realistically should lend suspension. most of these happen in my chem class when applicable. my teacher is so damn oblivious, but i think he's really going for retirement soon, probably because of us. and its really surprising that this happens considering its one of the most top-rated high schools."
964	51954	60	bniexw	en67zpu	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	hopefully we didn't have any blind kids at our school, because i once saw a turd that was well attached to the braille on the bathroom sign
965	51954	42	bniexw	en6h6dw	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	im a little late to the party. here goes. i was in army cadets, and one year i went to a summer camp. it was a 6-week course held in some military base up north. a feud developed between two units, and things were escalating. they damaged our barracks hot water heaters, and now out building had nothing but cold showers. we had to hit back hard. i volunteered for the mission. the plan was simple. we cadets did laundry all the damn time. washers and dryers were installed in every barrack. i was to shit in the dryer, turn it on, and run. a dirty-bomb, you might say. i did my job. i stuck my ass in that commercial dryer and dropped a log on some guys t-shirts and set it to high.
966	51954	106	bniexw	en5xmuc	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	had to go somewhere, didn't i?
967	51954	18	bniexw	en6bq8d	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we had someone in the news for something like this not too long ago.not a floor but in a public pool. like everytime the person does it, man they have to drain the whole pool and sanitize it and it's such a waste of time and money and from what i can remember they made the news because they were doing it a lot. can't recall if they've since been caught though
968	51954	72	bniexw	en68vjl	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i shit on my teachers desk after school because he told me i wasn't allowed to use the bathroom in his class.
969	51954	17	bniexw	en6ccmx	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i work at software companies and this behavior *still* happens on rare occasion. although my previous company actually complained when it occurred on the day of massive layoffs. okay -- *that* i could understand although it is not the company heads that will clean it up.
970	51954	36	bniexw	en62cig	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	the same ones piss on the floor too
971	51954	75	bniexw	en64rlt	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	well i did this in grade 5 actually. it was because i was mad at the custodian so i stood on the toilet seat and shit on the floor. >:)
972	51954	16	bniexw	en6gc7k	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i was feeling really really really awful and i happen to be going at both ends. literally on my way walking out of the building, i got a kick in my stomach telling me i had to throw up right now. so i go to the bathroom and throw up and realize hey! i also need to shit! so i consider my options: i can throw up on the floor and shit in the toilet, or shit on the floor and throw up in the toilet. now i have some serious issues related to pooping and im actually quite used to cleaning up shit off the floor, and i know its going to be in more of a piece than vomit, so i chose the latter. five minuets and im done so i do my best to clean up after myself, write a note that says im really sorry i wasnt feeling well and stick it too the empty toilet paper roll (i cleaned up with some paper towels i got) so only they will see it and leave as fast as i can. still feel absolutely horrible about doing it. ive known a person who did it out of anti-establishment reasons, but its not like theyre super there in the head. i tried telling them they were only hurting the custodians and they insisted the head of our school district would hear about it and resign for it because it would make him realize how shitty (get it) of a person he was. he did resign, but for other reasons, three years later. she thought it was because of her and was sent to the hospital a month later because she told her mom that the district head who stepped down was coming after her in the form of a fly, and that he built a machine to turn himself into said fly and that she has him captured but she doesnt want to kill him because shell be arrested for murder. shes on medicine now and doing much better, if youre wondering.
973	51954	15	bniexw	en6b9p3	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	this is literally happening right now in the building that i work in. imagine one of the paragon's of your industry, that's where i work for mine. we have a phantom pooper problem. they're threatening draconian measures. like we will guard the bathrooms, and you'll only be able to go to the bathroom in your section. we've suggested getting dna tests done on the specimen, but we'll see.
974	51954	14	bniexw	en6e38x	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	hahaha wasn't me and wasn't on the bathroom floor, but when i was in middle school, we had weird kids and weird bathrooms. there was an area with a large rounded sink for several people to use at once and no doors-- you would just walk into either the women's or men's (kind of hard to explain.) the school must've thought these security measures were enough for the bathroom so there were no security cameras anywhere. well, that changed one day when some kid took a dump in one of the sinks. ha. for a whole month, that bathroom was blocked off and we had an assembly discussing school rules. when the bathroom finally opened, the kid took another dump in the sink *the day it opened.* the bathroom was closed off again and they had security cameras installed around every bathroom. the kid was never caught though, hahaha.
975	51954	13	bniexw	en6ov9b	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we have a serial pooper at my work (costco). i'm talking clogged toilets and actual full sized turd down an aisle. went over the camera footage and this person knew exactly where to take a massive dump where it cut out of camera view. going through the footage we saw a woman run over it with her shopping cart, smearing it a ways down before she ditched her cart. i've narrowed it down to 3 regular shoppers and one of our staff. i'm not even sure how to bring it up to them if they're indeed the serial pooper.
