1352	49997	1506	bojhpr	eniy6n8	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	thank god for my nosey neighbors. i always used to hate how nosey they were. until this happened. when i was about 10 i was riding my bike outside. my parents always let me ride my bike outside during the summer, but only up and down the street we were on. one day, a man in a fan was parked across the street. he called to me, asking me if i had seen his dog and could help him find it. me, being a dumb child, offered to help him find it, and i started walking towards his van. my neighbor, and older white lady, came bolting out of her house hooting and yelling, telling the guy to back off. the dude got back in his car in a hurry and took off, and it wasn't until many years later that i realized how bad that situation could have been.
1353	49997	5303	bojhpr	enhyzd5	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"was a bouncer at a club in la for a minute in the 90's. stopped some dudes clearly affiliated (in a gang) at the door after they refused security checks. after a few minutes of their threats & manson lamps they left spewing all sort of warnings. a little later it starts to wind down and because it's a little slow & we're overstaffed so i start to drink. i get a bit drunk (not wasted, but sleepy-buzzed) so i tell my buddy i'm going to go lay down in the back of his car for a while. a few minutes after lying down i realize i have to piss. i get out and stumble a few into a spot between a guard gate (for a parking lot) and a building for a little privacy (there's a few dozen people milling around in front of the club). i'm about 25 feet away from the club's entrance and just off an alleyway. while i'm relieving myself, a dude runs right past in front of me, around the guard booth to my rear, and unloads a 9mm (recovered rounds from back seat/trunk/roof/bumper) into the back seat of the car i'd just crawled out of. ""bam bam bam bam."" unloading into the car. he then turns, runs right back past me, and down the alley into the night. don't think he saw me at all. nothing really came of it. except my partner was convinced i was a ""marked man"" and refused to be near me for a year or so. edit: holy crap, i kind of expected this to get buried. this was los angeles. i was about 25 (almost 50 now) so some specifics are long gone - but i remember this: my buddy was genuinely terrified by this, i don't think he knew anything about it (in fact he seemed to interpret the event as a larger conspiracy to have me snuffed - not some random pissed off dude making a point/getting jumped in) and because he ditched the car/wouldn't take my calls it got left at that. for those concerned with the car - it was, like, a 1980's rusted out sedan.maybe a $500 car. details about the slugs/number of rounds fired were relayed to me later by third parties (my friend and i were known in the neighborhood, people were talking about it). thank you for the well wishes. honestly though, this wasn't even the first time i was shot at (it's been a long strange trip). edit 2: also, i tried to argue later that it's just as likely the guy was shooting at someone else across the street and that the car just got in the way. but there were holes all through that thing. back seat had 4/5, another 2/3 went into the back window and ended up in the backs of the front seats, another 2/3 rounds went right into the trunk. i honestly don't know if he was a terrible shot, or if he hit right what he was aiming for. apologies if i'm doing this wrong, i suck at reddit."
1354	49997	563	bojhpr	enin57k	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was about 10 my grandfather was dying from complications of his heart issues and mentel deterioration. i didn't know him very well as the last time we had been in contact him was when i was a baby. my father never liked him and didn't bother coming with me and my mother to visit him in the hospital. when we got there he was resting peacefully and my mother went forward and whispered some words to him, i imagine about his current state of health. i hang back a little bit because the creepy old guy whome i didn't recall seeing in my whole life really freaked me out. regaurdless of my anxiety my mom said i should approach grandpa and share some nice words with him. i understood by how sad my mother was that i shouldn't argue too much so i approached his hospital bed to speak to him. he didnt seem concious at all so i just did what my mother did, leaning forward and just whisper some nice things to him. things took turn when mid sentence his eyes flair opon and he stares at me making me stop what im saying. my heart dropped into my ass when he looked at me because it was pure hatred in his eyes. as soon as we made eye contact he bolted upright from his bed and wrapped his hands around my neck and started throttling me as hard as he could. i barely even remember what happened but my mom was screaming for a nurse. and grandpa kept yelling at me while shaking my neck violently ""f*cking betrayal you betray me* and then he died. almost as fast as it began it was over. his grip loosened and he flat lined. my mother was inconsolable and i was extremely confused and crying out of sheer trauma at the situation. later after we managed to calm down a nurse explained to my mother that his severe dementia had left him barely coherent and it was likely he had thought i was someone else. i didn't learn this until several years later but my mother suspected my grandfather saw my father in me. my father was an alcoholic womanizor and fairly abusive in my earlier childhood and my grandfather resented him for it. i guess i look a little too much like my dad."
1355	49997	14664	bojhpr	enhy9d2	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	throwaway because it got some media. i'm a criminal defense attorney. i was representing this guy that had embezzled almost $500k from his business partner. he was looking down the barrel at several years in prison, a bunch of his assets had been seized by the government, was being sued by multiple creditors for north of $2 million, and was in the midst of an ugly divorce and wasn't allowed to see his kids. i was one of 3 lawyers he had - criminal, civil and divorce. he was drinking a lot and using coke -- i used to get this incoherent phone calls in the middle of the night that ranged from threats to crying. he came to my office one day and asked for me but i was in court. my secretary said he was perfectly civil. he then went to his divorce lawyer's office and shot him to death. got stopped by the police a short distance away and was wounded in a shootout. he would later tell the cops that he had come to my office to shoot me that day and also planned to shoot his civil attorney.
1356	49997	1586	bojhpr	eni1lws	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i have a friend who had a party at his parents house when he was in high school that a ton of random people went to. he got super drunk during the party and went upstairs to go to sleep, knowing that his friends would watch the party for him. my friend woke up from his nap to a guy from his school sitting on top of him stabbing him death. he was stabbed seven times before it stopped and he laid there on the bed dying. the only reason he is still alive is because his best friend came upstairs to ask him if it was alright if he made a frozen pizza and found him. the assailant was put in jail and recently was released and it scares me to know that a guy who wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone (said during the trial), is still out there free.
1357	49997	419	bojhpr	enii0bg	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	my dad has a client that owns a number of fast food restaurants. one day we were working at one of his stores (remodeling) and talking about robberies. the client told us that when he was just getting into the fast food business, he lived in colorado. he was assistant manager at a chain that required him to wear a tie. a drug addict came into the restaurant to rob them and grabbed him from behind, putting a knife to his throat. he opened the register and the guy attempted to slit his throat anyway, except the knife was dull and couldn't cut through the material of the tie. the client began to fight back and escaped with minor injuries. addict went to prison and apparently he has the tie in a frame at home.

"i was abducted at a gas station during undergrad. the locks on my car were broken, and as soon as i got back in, a strange man came in and forced me to drive him to an atm. i am paralyzed with fear so any sense or reason i had went out the window. he claimed he worked at wendy's and for my generosity he would give me all the wendy's i ever wanted. on the way to the atm he showed me pictures of his daughters (on his clearly stolen cell phone). then a whitney houston song came on the radio and he starts bawling his eyes out and screaming ""why do all the good people have to die, only bad things should happen to bad people."" i go to the atm, take out cash, give it to him thinking it's over. he then makes me get back in the car and drive him somewhere else. we pass by some train tracks and i'm thinking this is it, this is where i will be murdered. he asks me what i'm studying in school, and i tell him biochemistry. ""i believe in jet propulsion and all that shit. we are not alone aliens are among us."" he then makes me pull over at a gas station and he tells me ""drive away sweetheart"". i call the cops, had to do a line-up, apparently this dude had done this to a ton of other women, and some were less unscathed than i was."
1360	49997	545	bojhpr	enhzysd	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i jumped out of a moving vehicle. this was in college in a different country. there were commuter buses that takes us to and from the campus and dorms. i had to stay 30 mins later for a project so around 7:30 pm by then the commuter rush was gone. i was the only passenger and i was sitting at front next to the driver. he was acting already shady, it was dark and rainy. he made a sudden dark turn of a grassy unlit hill. he said somethings wrong with the tires. i said im getting off, he wont let me. the hill leads to a cliffside where rapes and murders have happned before. i had the pointy stick of my umbrella facing him ready to jab if he tried anything, which he tried to reach/grab for me. i jumped and ran straight to the highway were another commuter bus stopped surprised seeing a girl coming out of the tall grasses. i saw the driver of my previous ride, speeding away. nothing was wrong with his tires.
1361	49997	266	bojhpr	enij01j	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	our neighbours when i was growing up had three kids the same ages as myself and my siblings. we were all friends and got along well for the most part. their eldest child, i'll call him peter, has asperger syndrome and was known to have outbursts that would sometimes be violent. one day, when i was 5 or 6, our mothers decided to take all six of us to a nearby wading pool because it was hot out. well, due to that, it was pretty busy, and there were a lot of other kids. there were two lifeguards there, but were generally too busy chatting with each other to be doing their jobs (as my mother later tells me). i was off with my neighbour's daughter, was my age, and peter. i don't remember why, but he suddenly flew into a fit and decided that i was at fault for something. he, being about 8 and a lot bigger than me, grabs my head and holds it under the water. i remember that. i remember not being able to breath, i remember clearly thinking that i needed air or i was going to die. i remember fighting, but not being strong enough to get him off of me. then i remember my mom's face. she had a clear look of both terror and fury. i remember looking over and seeing peter sitting with his arms around his knees, rocking back and forth as his mother tried to calm him down. then i remember my mom absolutely losing it on the lifeguards who had missed everything and were clueless as to why this tiny woman was screaming at them that her daughter had almost drowned on their watch. to this day, i have a fear of swimming and absolutely do not like having water on my face, even when i'm showering.

"mines not extreme by any chance but a couple of years ago my brother and i went to walk the dog at like 11pm. we left through the side gate (live on a corner) and right as we exit i see this weird looking dude at the corner of the footpath walking weirdly towards us. got bad vibes and told my brother to get the dog and get back inside. this dude is walking kind of side on and hiding something in his hand behind his back, as i'm getting my brother through the gate the dude says something like ""oi mate can i come in, i need a blanket i'm freezing"" i just ignored him and went inside and locked the door. we then get a call from the people who live two doors up, the same dude knocked on their door and their 10yo son opened it to see the dude holding a fucking hatchet. anyway i'm glad i went with my gut on that one"
1363	49997	15789	bojhpr	eni0vsg	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	my supposed best friend decided that my wife and i were too perfect. therefore it must all be an act and i was obviously abusing her. he was at our house after i made an awesome dinner and we were having fun drinking and singing karaoke. i went to the kitchen to put some glasses away, came back and leaned on the couch with him slightly behind me to the left of me. then i heard a thunk and felt an amazing amount of pain on the top of my head. he had picked up the whiskey bottle on the table and smashed it into my skull. i was very confused as to wtf was happening. then the blood started pouring. i didn't want to get blood everywhere so i went to the kitchen. dude is pacing back and forth saying weird shit. i thought about my gun (which was close by) but i wasn't thinking quite straight. he left. i had a huge concussion and still suffer side effects from it. my number 2 goal in life is to live longer then that asshat just so i can shit on his grave.
1364	49997	14458	bojhpr	eni96q5	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i (18f back then, now 25) was on my way home at night after meeting a friend. my home was just 10 minutes away from the trainstation. after a few minutes i felt someone following me. no big deal i tought, just someone else walking home. but i started walking faster. i realized the person behind me was catching up.weird. in my head i started to make up scenarios of how to defend myself if the person would attack me. never would i think of this to actually happen. well, until i felt something on the back of my head, hitting me hard. i went furious. i turned around and attacked the guy. my mind was just full of anger towards this stranger who, what i thought, hit me. we were wrestling until i fell on the ground. he was sitting on top of me, strangling me. i tried to crawl my nails into his eyes as deep as i could, but i started to black out. suddenly there was this tought in my head ""wake up, or you will die"".well, adrenaline kicked in again and i opened my eyes and screamed of the top of my lungs, attacking him again. that helped. he stood up and began to run. i layed there for a few seconds, then i started to run home, still screaming. my mom was already at our door and opened for me because my screams woke her up (or her mother senses, who knows?) she immeadiately called the cops and they could arrest him on the same night. it turned out that he actually shot me in my head from behind. they assume that the gun didn't work properly, the bullet didnt penetrate my skull and stuck in there, but as far as i know they never found out why the gun misfired. i'm glad though. he told the cops that he already followed me a few times in the past, but never had the guts to ""do it"". he wanted to kill me and rape my dead body. i know that's a wild story, i have some swiss news paper articles as a source if someone cares though."
1365	49997	5261	bojhpr	enhtz1w	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	sophomore year of college went with a friend to go hang out at his old college. we were supposed to crash with a few friends of his but we met a few ladies and ended up at a pool party. next day went home and my friend started getting calls from one of his buddies moms asking if he'd seen him. turns out in the middle of the night a few guys broke into the house kidnapped my friends buddy and roomate. took there car and drove them out to the middle if nowhere and executed them. i guess it was part of some gang initiation. i was supposed to sleep there with my friend. i still somtimes think about it and get the shivers. edit: spelling. this happened in 1999 in stubenville ohio. someone posted a link to the wiki page in the comments. thank you to all the people who commented. i posted this before work and then my phone went crazy for the next few hrs.
1366	49997	21869	bojhpr	enhj2gd	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i was exiting a bar once after last call and was with a friend who was a medic. we saw a girl laying in a snow bank near a telephone pole who had just been hit by a car. we ran over and tried to help her, some others were already on the phone with 911 and i, not having any medical training didn't have anything to contribute but didn't want to just leave, the whole situation was concerning. &#x200b; i turn around for a second and start to hear people screaming. i turn around a a minivan was heading for us, the few people around this woman. they already started to run, but i was too late. &#x200b; he hit me as i was trying to flee. put the car in reverse, ran over me again, and then went forward and run over me a third time. &#x200b; turns out the guy was high and drunk and got into a fight with the women's bf, whom i bared a strong resemblance too. he thought i was him. not to throw a pity party for myself but 9 years later i have a ton of medical issues, and my life pretty much started on a downward spiral since then. but sure, i guess i ""survived"". **edit:** for everyone wondering about the guy, an off duty cop watched the whole thing go down, and copied his license plate number. he was apprehended 20 minutes later & charged with attempted murder, along with many other things. he plea'd out to just 3 years in jail. he had actually killed someone else a few years before drunk driving. how they thought that was appropriate is beyond me."

1369	49997	28843	bojhpr	enhsxzf	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was 14 and outside in my garage petting my cat. it was november so it was already dark by 5pm. someone opened the door behind me without me hearing, grabbed me by my ponytail and starting dragging me outside. they hit me on my head with a brick and knocked me out. pulled me halfway around my house when (i'm guessing this is when) they stabbed me on the left side of my stomach. this must have brought me out of my daze, because my mom said she heard me scream from inside where she and my brother and sister were in the kitchen. they came out the front door and saw me bleeding out on the side walk, called 911. had 12 stitches (double layer) a severe concussion, and whiplash. didn't eat and hardly slept for a week. they never found them. edit: somehow believed for nearly 14 years i was 15 when this happened, turns out i was 14. edited to correct. 2nd edit: thank you so much for my first gold! 
1370	49997	16481	bojhpr	enhotwv	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was riding in a train across eastern europe. i was running low on money and even though i had been warned that a woman should not travel alone in second class seating i did not spring for first class. i was sitting alone in one of the compartments that seats six. this was also a mistake and a very stupid one to sit alone. eventually the train stopped and a man got on - he was very drunk. he came into my compartment and i guess thought i looked like his ex-wife. he attacked me. if it were not for the fact that this particular station was the border between two countries i would be dead. instead border patrol from both countries were on the train and while i was unable to scream, the door was open and at least a half a dozen uniformed men jumped him and saved me. i was in the hospital for a little while but recovered. at one point during the trial, one of the cops asked me if i wanted him and his buddies to hold the guy down while i hit him. i thought he was joking. so i said no, go ahead you do it. i was also joking. but it turns out they took it seriously and were about to! i did put a stop to that at least. but they were so offended that someone from their country would attack a young female american tourist. they were furious with him. so many people there depended upon tourism
1371	49997	7703	bojhpr	enhnqac	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"this all happened many years ago. i was a lead man at a factory. a girl starts working there, and i take an interest. after a few months, i find out she is in a terrible drug-fueled abusive relationship. every night, i tell her to call me, i'll come get her. finally after months, she calls me, i come get her and take her to my house. the guy she was in the relationship with didn't take too kindly to me taking her away. he spends the next 2 years harassing and threatening us. a few months after she and i got married we went out for a few drinks. her ex just happened to be at the bar we went to. he apologized to us for the threats and harassment. we were sitting outside talking with a few other people. next thing i know, i'm on my back on the ground with someone choking me. i try all i can to get them off of me, but being blindsided and them being on top of me, it wasn't easy. as i struggle to get free, everything goes black, then i see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"". in that moment i was certain that this was the end of me. i somehow manage to get a better hold of this person's head, and i yank them off of me. we run to the car and get away. a week or so later, my wife had been talking to everyone she thinks might know what happened. turns out, her ex had paid 2 people $50 to kill me that night."
1372	49997	6699	bojhpr	enhy33u	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i was doing volunteer work in central america, working in a really bad area of the capitol city--it was a slum built on top of the city's garbage dump. the whole place reeked of trash, and there were large metal cylinders coming up out of the ground throughout the area to vent the gas from decomposing garbage underground. as a fellow volunteer and i walked down a dirt path, two men approached us. i'd never seen them before. they were acting strangely, but i just thought they were drunk or high--a lot of people in the area drank rubbing alcohol to get drunk, since it was cheaper than beer or liquor. over time, drinking the rubbing alcohol would really mess with their brains. as the men got closer, they began acting really friendly--too friendly. one of them came close to me, trying to put his arm around my shoulders. at first, it seemed like the behavior of a guy who gets happy and friendly when he's drunk. however, an alarm went off in my head, and i gently--but firmly--pushed him away. i tried to make it seem lighthearted and playful, like, ""hey, man! how's it going?"" (affectionate shove.) i didn't want to make a scene, since i was a gringo; i didn't want to seem like an ugly american. this went on over and over down the whole path--he'd get close, i'd shove him off, he'd come close again. finally, my friend and i came to a fork in the path, and we went one way while they went another. after we got to the house of some people we knew, we told them about the two guys. (i was so focused on protecting myself, i didn't even notice much of what was happening with the other guy.) they said, ""oh, everyone around here knows him. that's his routine--he comes up to people, pretends to be friendly, puts him arm around them, then pulls out his knife and stabs them in the stomach."" i was *that* close to getting stabbed to death."
1373	49997	802	bojhpr	enhufha	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"wow - a serious post i can actually comment on. it wasn't a murder attempt (maybe it was.?) but a stabbing attempt i guess. happened when i was around 12-13 years old. i was taking a lifeguarding course at a local pool with a friend of mine which had about 16 people in the class. the age ranges in the class can vary, and we probably had a mix of people between 12-18, but most were somewhere in the middle. there was this one kid, probably 16-17 that really stood out to me and my friend as the typical ""school shooter"" type. very solemn look on his face at all times, socially awkward and extremely quiet. we both got really strong serial killer vibes from him. it's just one of those instincts you feel that tells you ""something isn't right"" we made a few jokes between ourselves about it, as we both noticed it almost immediately and were fairly uncomfortable being around him. this lasted for probably the first 2 hours of the 4 hour class. at that point we were asked to switch from pool instruction into a classroom, and had about 20 minutes to change and get into the classroom. as we are all changing, this guy kept looking over at me and my friend - we tried not to make eye contact with him and just ignore it but we were getting extremely uncomfortable with how intensely the guy was staring. we were the only 3 in the changeroom and were intent on leaving as fast as possible. eventually, my friend makes eye contact with the guy, who screams something along the lines of ""stop looking at me"", pulling a switchblade out of his swim bag and lunging at my friend. i stood there, somewhat frozen as this was happening and didn't really know what to do - whether to try and help or run. my friend ended up blocking the initial lunge with the locker door, and he sprinted towards the front exit of the changeroom, with this enraged knife-wielding teenager chasing him. when my friend had made it out of the changeroom the maniac turned around and started chasing me down. with pool deck floors, they are extremely slippery and almost impossible to run on but 12 year old me wasn't exactly worried about that at this point. &#x200b; i had to run from the changeroom/locker area, through the bathrooms, through a shower room and then onto the pool deck (the only other exit) all i remember is him catching up to me and he must have been within reach at some point on this 100m run, but i remember turning around once i made it on the pool deck and the guy was gone. i was half dressed, and basically still sprinting towards the lifeguard office. &#x200b; once there i found our instructor and told him what happened - and he didn't believe me. he said i was lying and was just picking on the kid, nothing happened. etc. so i told him to try and find my friend with me (i was panicking, hyperventilating, but apparently not believable). my friend was still out in the lobby now with a ton of concerned parents around trying to figure out what was going on. turns out when he blocked the knife with the locker door the knife got his forearm and he was bleeding pretty badly (not arterial, but probably a 6"" gash on the hairy part of your arm) immediately my instructor ushered us away and called the police, building went into lockdown, etc. &#x200b; to this day i have no idea what happened to that kid - he never came back to the class, and the police didn't find him that night. i'm assuming he got arrested but i never heard about it. it was probably the closest i ever came to getting killed and i'm not exactly sure why/how he didn't stab me, or if he slipped and fell before making it to me. he was considerably larger than me and definitely faster. &#x200b; all i know now is i should trust my instincts more with people - they might turn out to be true. &#x200b; **tl;dr: almost got stabbed by a knife-wielding teenager in a lifeguarding course, ran out and the teacher didn't believe me, found friend with a bloody arm and the kid disappeared.**"

1375	49997	2714	bojhpr	enhz0am	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	so, i did not know it was a murder attempt at the time, but looking back now - it was a definite possibility. in middle and high school my next door neighbors were a boy one year younger than me (john) and his younger brother who was four years younger than him (nathan.) my own younger brother and i had a similar age gap, and we found ourselves around each other all the time. now i am a female and the rest of the group was all males, so there were just naturally times when the three of them would hang and i wouldn't be around. &#x200b; one day my little brother who was around 9 at the time comes home with a porno mag and is telling me about the porn videos they were watching as a little unit. now guys, i have no idea if this is something that is done in your pre/adolescent circles, but it freaked me the hell out and i told my mom. my mom then went and told their single dad. what i didn't know was their dad was an abusive piece of shit who beat both of those boys so badly that they couldn't go to school for weeks. no, we didn't call the police - we just filed it away and knew from that point forward to never tattle. i still carry the guilt of telling on john and nathan with me to this day, because it set off a chain of events i would have never anticipated. &#x200b; as we got older, the brothers started acting out more and more; bullying other kids, vandalism, weird shit like toying with road kill. as the level headed female in the group i opposed all of these things, and a faction emerged with me and the other neighborhood kids on one side, and john and nathan on the other just fucking shit up and causing trouble. one day i had done something to piss off john, and he came at me with a large chef's knife. i didn't have shoes on, so i took off running through the backyard and crossed into the neighbor's. john was hot on my tail, trailing me by maybe 4 feet when i fell down. there was some sort of exposed pvc drainage pipe that had been shattered at the top that i didn't see it and ran over, my foot was sliced open immediately and i went down screaming. i think it shocked him; my screaming, the sudden change of pace, and the blood. he stopped, laughed at me, then ran home- presumably so he didn't get his ass whipped. &#x200b; after i took care of myself, i told my mom what happened with the knife. she had started dating someone new, and i think this was the sort of feather that broke the camels back. we moved to another part of town in the same district about a ten-minute drive from our old house. around that exact time we moved in, a new family moved into the house on the other side of john and nate. &#x200b; things continued down a bad path for those boys. over the next year they got in trouble with school, and would randomly show up at our new house locked out of their own. the year i went off to college i received a panicked phone call from my mom telling me to look up the local newspaper, john had murdered the girl who had moved into the other house next door to him. it was really grisley too, he chopped her up and stuffed her into a trunk that sat outside in his dad's car all day while a family picnic was happening. he and his little brother got caught trying to throw the trunk into the river from a bridge at night by a cop who happened to be driving by. i just thought to myself that could have been me! both brothers have been locked up for what has to be about ten years at this point, they were both tried and convicted as adults. everyone in our town just wants to see them burn in hell, but honestly the only thing i can think about is how it might have been different if our family reported the abuse from the onset - maybe their little minds would'nt have warped from a tender age.
1376	49997	10980	bojhpr	enh2d1h	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i got jumped by two grown men when i was a freshmen in college. i was walking back from my friends house and it was about 30 past midnight. one posed as a homeless man asking for a dollar and the other had on a security jacket like he worked for the universitys safety patrol. when i passed the homeless guy saying i had nothing to give him, i saw the security guy walking towards me. this is when i felt a rear neck choke hold and the security guy started whaling on me. i had my bag on me, but like i said, i literally had nothing on me. they couldnt take me down to the ground (surprisingly.i mustve had an adrenaline rush). the guy posing as a homeless guy said open the back pack, find anything lets dip. this lasted about 2-3 minutes, but it felt like forever. the whole time i could feel something pointy in my back, but i just like to think that the guy was extremely excited, and it wasnt a knife. luckily, it was right outside my friends house and a couple of them came running out when they heard the commotion. the guys fled immediately when 3 of my friends came sprinting towards them. i still look behind me when i walk home alone.
1377	49997	2580	bojhpr	eni6fn2	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"well idk if this counts as an attempt or not but my wife, my kids and myself went to church one time and we ran into one of my wife's old ""flings"", this guy followed my wife around and our daughter and kept trying to talk to them. so i confronted him about it and told him to back off. as we were leaving he makes sure to yell across the parking lot telling my daughter good bye. my wife forces me in to the car and we leave. so i message the guy on facebook to ask him what his problem is and he tells me that my wife and daughter are his friends and i have no right to tell them who to be friends with. i told him again to back off our i would call the police. fast forward a week (i worked every other sunday) i get a call from the pastor saying that they had to call the police on the guy because he was causing drama looking for me. when they arrested him he had a back pack with him that had a sawed off shotgun, a meth pipe and some meth in it."

"when i was two weeks into my first job as a 16 year old (at a smoothie establishment that should be known to nba fans), we were robbed. it was late, and my coworker's friends had been playing pranks on her all day, so when i saw someone burst through the door, i thought it was just that. until, that is, i had something metal pressed against my back and an arm wrapped around my chest. the robber gave the whole stereotypical ""give me all the money"" spiel, and ordered us to go into the back room, kneel down, and face the wall. as i was kneeling and hearing him walking towards us, time seemed to slow down. thankfully, i had been refilling juices whenever he came in, and so the door to the back room was partially blocked by a heavy cart. with whatever substance he was on, he wasn't coordinated enough to get past it to us, so he fled. he was followed by my coworker's husband and caught. when he was caught, they found an industrial sized pipe wrench wrapped tightly in his fist, so that he could get a stronger grip when swinging. i'm so glad that cart was there. once a year or so, i would look him up in the parish prison roster to see if he was still in jail. one year, he suddenly wasn't. i later found him named in a lawsuit as having stabbed his cellmate a half dozen times while the guy was asleep. definitely doesn't seem like the nicest of people. nine years later, i'm still unpacking this incident in therapy - it's why i dont like walking around cities at night or sitting where i can't see the door."

"my dad was a meth addict. he did lots of fucked up things - dropping me off at trap houses to have ""sleepovers"" with other ""coke babies"", living in a house full of animal shit and hoarding. he sicked his pitbull on a black child. he was a real fucking character. one night he came looking for my mom and i at our place. mom wasn't there. grandma was babysitting me. i was sleeping in bed when somebody started to try and open my window. it was locked, but they kept jamming something into the bottom to try and force it open. at the same time, i heard the living room door being tried by somebody else. my grandma snuck into my room in her nightgown, apparently woken up by the same thing, and told me say nothing. don't even whisper. we laid under my bed while a group of men shouted for my mom to come out, slammed their hands on the windows to try and break them, and jumped on my grandma's car. she called the police and barely whispered into the phone. eventually the cops arrived and the men scattered. long story short, my dad and his other methhead friends came to the house with guns and knives with every intention to kill me and my mother because she was going to get custody of me. if my mom wasn't so vigilant with locks (we had three different kinds on the front and back doors), we would have died."

1384	49997	9134	bojhpr	enhumck	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	in my late teens, i used to buy my weed from random dudes in the projects (low income housing.) one day we gave some money to a guy named 40. he took it and went inside one of the buildings. we waited in the car for several minutes. we started to think he had taken our money and left. right about that time, a car full of coked-up white dudes pulled up beside ours. apparently my friend owed them money. they pointed a gun at him and said that if he had enough money to buy weed, then he could pay them back. i really thought they were going to shoot us and just drive off like it was nothing, and i hadn't even done anything wrong. i thought i was gonna pee my pants. right about that time, 40 came back out with our weed and an even bigger gun. he scared them away and then we went back to his apartment and smoked a blunt. what a good man. turns out he was only selling weed because he had a 6-year-old daughter and that was the only way he knew to give her a better life than he had. i babysat his daughter occasionally for the rest of that summer. i really hope she got a decent childhood and that her dad stayed safe and out of jail. **tldr; almost got shot but was saved by random drug dealer who turned out to be a decent fellow.**
1385	49997	15581	bojhpr	enhia85	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was out with a few friends, and with us was a girl that had just broken up with a psychopath (we didn't know he was a psychopath, we found out that night). we were just walking back home from a restaurant, it was about 1 am, and the guy came running out of nowhere, i don't know how he knew where and when to meet us. he ran to the girl, lifted her shirt up and stabbed her in the gut, literally splitting her belly open like a fish, and then ran off. this whole thing happened really quickly, so we were all in shock. the girl was holding her own intestines in her hands and she was so shocked that she didn't even seem scared, wasn't screaming or anything. she just stood there. we called an ambulance and they managed to somehow put everything back and sew her up. this happened about 3 years ago and she still has pretty serious problems with her digestive tract, can't eat certain things and that kind of stuff. that image of her just standing in the middle of the pathway holding her own guts will remain stuck in my head forever. the guy got 13 years in jail btw. edit: now that i think about it, a big part of why they broke up was his constant abuse towards her weight. she wasn't even fat, just a bit on the chubby side, i wouldn't even call that overweight, but he would always tell her that she had a big gut. that was almost an obsession for him. so maybe the fact that he stabbed her in the abdomen is a symbolic action of some sort. i don't know what was in that fuckhead's brain and i honestly don't even want to know.

1387	49997	6550	bojhpr	enhnt9w	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	when i was a kid i was riding my bike home from a friends house at sunset. i rode past the community pool which had been closed for a couple months. there was a car in the lot with a guy in it. i didnt think much of it as i continued the trek home. i cut through the local elementary parking lot which has gates. i get like 20 yards past the gate and i see that car pull up at the bottom. thinking thats odd. anyhow he backs out away from the gate. my spidey senses were kinda tingling at this point. i get up to the school and head towards teacher parking lot which is my standard direction. as im about to turn the corner i see headlights from the parking lot. i stop and peek around the corner and its that fucking guy again. i flip my bike around and start going the long way around the school. he sees me but just gets back in his car. and starts driving around the front of the school. i camp in these bushes, heart pounding. he is slowly driving up and down the front of the school keeping an eye on the teachers lot. another car comes down the street and he has to move his dumb car out of their way. as soon as he does i just blasted up to the street and full tilt flew my bike into some random open garage. so im hiding in the garage waiting for him to come around again. but he doesnt. i give it a few minutes then decide to pop my head out. still no one. ok im a few blocks from home just gotta go for it. bust out the bike and start hauling ass home. not half a fucking block later this dude turns the corner on me. i just veer my bike into some random lawn and run up to the front door. i look at him and hes just in the street staring at me. i grip the front door handle praying to any and every god these people dont lock their doors. i see his reverse lights flicker and i know he just put it in park. i just rip that door open, run inside and slam it. two old people just sitting there. i look at them and im like some dude is trying to get me out there. they dont completely believe me cause they barely react to what i said. but they dont kick me out or anything either. im watching the dude from their window and hes just chilling. then the grandpa looking dude gets up from his lazy boy and opens the curtain to look for himself. when he does this the asshat in the car just leaves. old guy is like well looks like hes gonna leave. im like im not leaving for a bit. so i hang out for 10 min and no creepy abductor car to be seen. i assume he figured i called the cops. finally im like i have to get home. this is before cell phones were common for average people. i hop on my bike and i swear it felt like i drove 35 mph the whole way home. get home and tell my parents. im exhausted and in complete shock. they basically brush me off. im stunned that every adult i interacted with acted like i was crazy. i basically never talked about it again it was so traumatic to talk about at the time. that image of him in his car while i held the door handle to the random house is permanently seared into my brain. to this day its still as crystal clear as if it happened yesterday. like 18-20 years later i decided to confront my parents as to why they didnt do anything that day. they were like wtf you talking about. i explained it far better than i couldve when i was a kid in complete shock. anyhow, with the current, more expansive explanation my mother b-b-b-broke down. she started crying at this public restaurant cause she saw how serious i was when i was like how could you ignore what i said that day. as well as talked about how that morphed my stranger danger techniques for better or worse. thankfully i was on the verge of puberty and ended up becoming a giant human being so my actual fears diminished quickly as i could defend myself. until i moved away from that town however, i looked every day for that god damned car. never saw it again. i would fantasize about what id like to do if i ever found that guy, hell, i still do. tldr dude tried abducting me at like 10-12 years old. got lucky hiding in random garage and some old peoples house. never got any level of justice edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger

"my sister had this one friend when we were growing up i always got a bad vibe from. she would try to pick on my little brother but i would always stop her. i was 8, she was 10. once we were at a lake and all the kids were swimming. i swam out to the deep roped off part but i was still little and really shouldn't have. she kept acting weird and getting closer to me making this weird laugh. she pushed me off the wooden pole in the water and i got scared and started to swim back but she came up behind me and pushed me under the water. it didn't click at first that she was trying to drown me but after she aggressively pushed me under the 3rd time i had this crazy moment of clarity. it was like the world slowed down ever so briefly. i relaxed and let myself sink, swam underneath her, and came up behind her. i grabbed her hair and shoved her face into the water, keeping my legs on her back so her body couldn't rise. i waited until her struggling slowed down and let her come up. i waited in the water saying nothing, bracing myself for her retaliation but she just looked panicked and swam back to shore. i told my sister who had already expressed that the girl was weird. we confronted her together and she just looked really dazed. in a monotone voice she said ""i'm sorry, i didn't know it would be like that."" it wasn't until i replayed those words in my mind later that i realized what she was saying was 'sorry i tried to drown you, it wasn't until i was almost drowned myself that i realized how horrible it is to do to someone.'"
1395	49997	990	bojhpr	enibgzm	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was shot while working in a small independent video game shop. this place was a very small store in a somewhat sketchy area, but we had never had problems before. on the night in question, a gentleman came in and, without saying a word, goes straight into the porn section/caged off area. the gentleman emerges from the porn cage with his selections and proceeds to toss his selections on the counter. now this part is very important. i go to retrieve the discs for the pornography in question, which we kept in giant cd binders that held about 500-750 discs when completely full, which they were in this case, since we had just received some new stuff. as i turn to place the binders on the counter, i hear what i now know to be the hammer being cocked. at the time i thought nothing of it since it is a video game store and we had demos on and available for people to play. as i turned to face the customer, i can now see the customer has a gun out and pointed at me. a moment or two passed with neither of us saying anything, and me holding the binders in front of my chest. and then he pulled the trigger. i don't remember much else after that, mostly because i was face down on the ground trying very hard not to move, breath obviously, or make any kind of noise. i hear him go through the register (he got all $60 in there) and then go through the game cases (he stole at least five empty psp game cases) before he bolted. according to the emt's who tended to me, the bullet traveling through the stack of three completely full(ish) cd binders slowed the bullet down enough to the point where it hardly penetrated. it only went about 1-2 inches deep and i somehow managed to get hit in the one area of my chest/shoulder area where nothing vital was. tl;dr guy shot me at work in order to rob the place, porn saved my life. \*edit: spelling and grammar errors \*edit: here is my proof (warning: giant hairy chest and the scar looks a blurry nipple, so slightly nsfw) [http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz](http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz)

"about 10 years ago i used to share a 3 bedroom apartment with a friend, so we had a spare room. at some point he told me he had met some nice guy, who was older and a philosophy book translator, and he was looking for a place. i thought the extra money would be nice so i was ok with it. so the guy moves in, he's very reclusive so we don't talk much, but i start to get a weird vibe from him. one day i had to go to work meeting about 3 hours earlier than normal, so i woke up, dressed and left. he and my other friend had already left, so the apartment was left unattended. the meeting was over sooner than i anticipated, so i decided i would have lunch at home. when i arrive at the building, there's a fire truck in the streets, and the doorman runs towards me as soon as he sees me, telling that there was a gas leak in my apartment and they had to cut the gas to the whole building, and they were about to break into the apartment to check. when i enter the apartment i immediately smell the gas, and when i go check the kitchen i see all the stove's valves open. i called my friend and told him what happened, he called the other guy and he didn't answer. i went to check his bedroom and it was empty. the guy just left with all his stuff and tried to asphyxiate me while i slept. i didn't pursue it, and we never heard of the guy again. **edit: ok, i know i should have pursued it. it was over 10 years ago, i was young and this whole thing was very scary. i lost my sleep for weeks after this, and i still check the stove even 10 years later. the thing is, where i live, the police usually won't pursue ""attempted"" anything unless you have a shitload of money, which i don't. and at the time me and my friend decided to let it go because we would have no way to prove he actually did it, and it wasn't one of us who forgot the stove's valves open (the first thing i did when i saw them open was to close them all). i know i fucked up. things would be very different if they happened today.**"

1406	49997	1812	bojhpr	enhq28w	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was 15 my schoolfellow, whose brother i was friendly with, asked me to follow him outside to a lightly wooded area behind our school where kids used to go smoke. everything seemed totally normal- we were making casual small conversation- and once we got to the spot i said ""hold on, i have to take a piss"". turned my back on him to do the deed and next thing i felt was a super hard punch to my upper right back. turns out this ""punch"" was actually a stab- specifically, a stab with an 8"" knife. he was kind enough to a) inform me i'd been stabbed and b) remove the knife. survival instinct kicked in and i fell to the ground pretending to be dead, because he would of kept going otherwise. once i fell to the ground he took my watch off my hand, which we soon learned (according to him) was the impetus for the stabbing- he planned to pawn it (a $200 fossil watch my mom bought my on vacation to italy a couple years earlier) and buy some coke. once he ran off and i started getting up i noticed something was very wrong. i couldn't breath. my friends happened to be behind the school when i emerged from the wooded area yelling for them to go get help as i'd just been stabbed. they thought i was joking around as i usually did, but one of them finally came over after i fell to my knees and saw i was being for real, blood going everywhere. they'd fetched a teacher who proved to be the human embodiment of incompetence- she got the bright idea to have me lay on my stomach, which could of expedited the process of flooding my lungs with blood, but thankfully didn't as i only stayed in that position for a few seconds. the pain began to intensify as i was constantly gasping for air, but also some nerve damage had been done and my movement was greatly constricted. they propped me up against the lockers by the back entrance, where my blood coated the wall, and it took about 25 min for the ambulance to arrive. i was still in a great deal of pain even with the oxygen mask on, but it was nothing compared to the pain i'd experience shortly after in the er/or where they made a 5-6"" incision under my armpit in order to get at my lung so that they could insert a chest tube. the feeling of having the doctors hands inside of me, feeling around and holding my lung while i was still awake (under local anaesthetic) is the most bizarre thing i've ever encountered and a sensation i will never forget. i still don't know why they couldn't have put me under fully for such a procedure instead of administering local all around my body. at this point my parents had been brought in and were in hysterics after seeing me on the or table with blood everywhere. my mom was at home when the principal called to notify her what'd happened and ordered a cop to drive her to the hospital, a trauma centre about 30 min away from our home. my dad was at work on a construction site and went into a rage, getting together a band of his friends/workers to come to the hospital to find out who did this- they wanted to go kill the guy, but my mom managed to talk some sense into him. i was the most innocent 15 year old kid, never into drugs, alcohol, gangs, etc. and struggled for a long time with the question of ""why me?"" when there were so many much worse people out there than me. not that anyone deserves this kind of punishment. was a $200 watch worth it? i spent a couple weeks in the hospitals trauma unit and then a further month or two at home recovering. whoever stitched me up did a horrible job as they kept coming undone and i had to visit the er several times to have that fixed. bleeding out in public was not fun. psychologically it honestly didn't do too much damage as i think i was just too young to grasp the full weight of what'd happened. but physically it left the entire area around my upper right back and right arm/armpit completely numb for the rest of my life. i was also told that the lung could randomly collapse at any time-- apparently that's a possibility for those having suffered a traumatic pneumothorax, can anyone confirm?--, but it's been almost 15 years since the incident and i haven't had any major issues with the lung thus far. the guy who did it was 17 and protected by the young offenders act here in canada, which means he did zero jail time for this. i think he just got some community service hours. blows my fucking mind- what a dysfunctional system."

"any of those stupid robbots on youtube, i don't give any of you permission to use this in your video. like a decade+ or so when i was a kid my family and i took a trip to tanzania for safaris. well, one night near the kenyan border we were out spotlighting for bush babies when a pair of headlights appear in the distance and blocks our car. a bunch of dudes with aks hop out of their truck and our tour guide drops his head to the wheel and keeps his hands on it. me, being what like 10 whined ""what's happening"" and my parents basically quietly and sternly told me to shut the fuck up and stay down. any time the guys with guns ask our tour guide questions he would just mumble responses and not look up. apparently my mom watched the dudes rubbing their crotches and staring at her and my sister (who is just a year older than me). after probably like 10 minutes (but it was so long ago and i was so young i don't really know) the dudes put their guns down, hop in their vehicle, and drive away. while pressing our tour guide for questions we would only get response like ""oh they were just game wardens looking for poachers"" and other bullshit. turns out it was (according to my parents after snooping around) a kenyan militia who goes around and kidnaps tourist groups to hold for ransom. they stop one group, call up the owner of the park/ preserve, and say basically they'll let this group go if he agrees to pay the ransom but if he doesn't they'll kill them and ruin his business if they don't get x amount of money. if the game warden agrees to their ransom then they let the first group go. if he doesn't then they kill and/or rape them. and then try again with the next group. if he doesn't pay the ransom by then, well you get the picture. awfully, although this was one of the more urgent near death experiences our family has had, we still laugh about it since something terrible like this happens on nearly every trip we go on with the family. israel and egypt, nearly had bombs go off on us. south africa, got stuck in a river with a very territorial hippo and jeep stuck on a termite mound with a very pissed leopard stalking us. also in tanzania i stuck my face in a boomslang and didn't notice. india something else happened but i don't remember what, i'll add it if i remember. it's a running gag with our family at this point, and we just assume any family trip we take something awful will go wrong. so much weird random shit happens to our family that our friends ask ""what happened this time?"" after a trip. edit i remembered another story from south africa, while we were out on safari a thunderstorm had rolled in, so we headed back to the camps. a bolt of lightning had struck the building directly next to ours (like 15 feet away) and burned it to the ground. the lady who was staying there, another tourist, handled it super well. she was just excited to have a cool story to tell! sadly she lost her luggage and passports in the fire but i'm sure it ended up okay. she didn't seem too troubled."

"there is this bar that my friends and i will go to sometimes. hole in the wall place in the country in some back roads. the kind of bar where interesting things sometimes go down. it's not unusual to have a quiet night playing some pool and sipping beer while some dude strums a guitar in the corner. it's also not unusual for a fight to break out or some kind of screaming match. my buddies and i love it for that reason. the drink is cheap and you never know what the night will turn into there. one time i even discovered a couple of folk.uh.*""eloping""* in a porta potty. but that's not how i was almost murdered. anyway, i had just finished having a couple of drinks with some old high school friends and had paid my tab and walked outside to the truck. one of my buddies was in the truck passed out sleeping (didn't know when to quit i guess) and my other buddy was inside paying his tab. so i am left out there by the truck with the passed out buddies girlfriend at the time. we were just standing there talking about whatever when all of a sudden the bar door swings open and this fat little young guy, all of 5 foot tall comes bursting out yelling and pointing at me. he had like 3 girls chasing him down trying to calm him down or whatever. he starts moving at me like an angry rhino doing the douchebag strut saying ""hey motherfucker! hey! you think it's okay for you to disrespect a woman like that!?"" i am completely in the dark as to what the heck he is talking about whatsoever so i say something like ""uh.i have no idea what you are talking about whatsoever."" he proceeds to get real close to me like he is gonna fight me and still yelling about disrespecting some female or something. i basically stand my ground and tell him to btfo because i don't know what he is talking about. i guess seeing that i was willing to defend myself via fisticuffs made the ruffian back off. he said something like ""yeah okay, bitch. okay!"" and started walking to his car. this made all the girls in his little possie start *really* trying to calm him down. i knew exactly what was happening. he was going for a gun. i was right. he reached in his car, pulled out a silver 1911 and racked the slide. now, usually in this scenario, i would have drawn my gun and shot the guy. but i was at a bar and i was a good boy who didn't have my gun at a bar because laws. he was probably 20 feet away so i didn't know if it was really loaded or not. the whole racking the slide thing probably tells me that it was not. but either way, gun.bad guy.not good. so i did something dumb. i put my hand behind my back like i was gonna draw and pointed at him with the other hand and said ""if you point that gun at me, i will kill you. right now."" my buddies girlfriend knew what was up and said ""he's a veteran and he is armed!"" dude, just stared at me for a sec, and put the gun back in the car while all his little chicks swarmed him. he goes back inside the bar. finally the other buddy comes out and i'm like ""wtf have you been!?"" funny thing is angry rhino-bro came back out a couple of minutes later and hugged me saying ""oh sorry dude. thought you were someone else."" okay, dickhead."

"posted this in r/askreddit a couple years ago: ""almost 20 years ago now i had a guy offer to walk with me. it was. 3 am? i'm a guy. at that point a fairly wild one who didn't think about being anywhere, doing anything, time of day, etc. the dude just kind of appeared on the street across from me. he started half-shouting a monologue at me. at first i just ignored it figuring he as hammered drunk, told him ""nah, i'm good"" and kept strutting, not thinking twice about him. a dog trotted out of some yard and started walking next to me. he asked if it was mine. ""nope"". then he asked if i smoked weed. i told him ""yup"" so he asked i wanted to share a joint. ""nope"". then he told me he'd sprinkle some coke on it if i wanted. ""nope"". the whole time he hasn't crossed the street. he's just woofing at me. but he's looking around all over the place. seems to be checking to see if there are any other people out. my spidey senses started to tingle at that point. i was only a few blocks from my house so i figured i'd just keep walking and head in. that's when he asked if i wanted to see his gun. ""no thanks"". instead of going home i turned in to a gangway between two houses and realized that an acquaintance of mine lived in one of the houses so i started pounding on her door. after a few seconds i peeked out to the street and didn't see the guy so i wandered out to the front yard, looked around and he was gone. disappeared. maybe. 3 weeks later i saw in the newspaper that the police had arrested a guy who was a suspect in several sexual assaults, rapes and murders in the general area over a period of years. it was that dude. if something feels out of the ordinary or uncomfortable. trust your instinct."""

1442	49997	54	bojhpr	enijm3i	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	this isnt my story, but it is my dads. back in 1979 my dad was a orphaned high schooler living with his evil, nasty aunt who he was left in custody to several years earlier due to my grandmother passing. his cousin from ireland, brian, had come to live with them as well at some point in 79. brian was just as evil and nasty and with a terrible drinking problem. but everyone in the family loveeedddd brian and thought he was the victim all the time. no matter what brian did, he was the angel and my dad was the harasser and the bully. brian registry stole money from my dad, planted drugs on him in an attempt to get him arrested two months before my dad left for the marine corp and ultimately tried to have my dad murdered. my dad was walking home after his late night shift at mcdonalds when a car came careening at him off the road onto the sidewalk. my dad jumped into a bush and narrowly avoided the car. my dad gets up and sees that its a friend of brians who is a local drunk. i cant remember his name but we will call him john. john revs the car in reverse and forward again in an attempt to hit my dad again. he misses again and starts chasing my dad up the street with the car going up and off the sidewalks trying to nick my dad. this went on for about two minutes until finally john crashed the car into a telephone pole. john gets out of the car and drunkenly starts to chase my dad and tell him hes gonna fucking kill him. my dad was luckily in better shape because he was preparing to go into the marines. he was able to outrun john and took refuge at a local convenience store. my dad never called the cops or pressed charges because he was leaving in two months and because his previous run in with the cops when john planted the drugs on him left a bad taste in his mouth with the local law enforcement. he never also told much of the family anyways since they all sided with brian as it was for everything. this left my dad and his family at odds for many years and he didnt speak to much of his immediate family for nearly a decade or so afterwards when some fences were mended. the day brian died from cirrhosis in 06 and my dad found out he told his aunt that he hoped brian was rotting in hell. i tried to condense the story as best as i could. if anyone has any questions just feel free to act tl;dr my dads alcoholic cousin tried to have him murdered literally for no reason.
1443	49997	295	bojhpr	eni55vq	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"in 2017, i was at a trolley station in national city, ca, buying a ticket when some big dude about 250 pounds and 6' 1 walked up and sucker punched me in the side of the head (i'm 5'11"", 165 lbs). i went down hard, hitting my head on the concrete. then he grabbed my legs and tried to push me onto the tracks. there was nobody on this side of the tracks (southbound), but tons of people on the other side, which is also a waiting area for buses. i shouted like hell for help while kicking at him and suddenly, after about 45 seconds, he backed off and apologized, saying something about having had a bad day with his wife. he backed off, i jumped up and picked up my stuff (phone and wallet, which i had had out while buying a ticket), and yelled at him to get the fuck out of there. then he just walked away slowly. i called the cops and gave them a very good description, actually following behind the guy for a while as he plodded away. they showed up and detained the wrong guy at first. then my attacker just walked up to the cops and confessed. he explained to them that he thought i was the one who had been sleeping with his wife. apparently a case of mistaken identity, but my head still hurt six hours later, so i went to the hospital to get checked out (moderate concussion). as i had been falling to the ground, i clearly saw a security camera pointed right at me. the district attorney got footage and told me i had been hit pretty hard. the guy ended up getting convicted of felony assault and got 10 months in jail. he was also wanted by san diego pd, so i don't know what other trouble he had gotten into. i can tell you that i saw his wife in court, and there was no way i was sleeping with her. the aftermath of this is: 1) i was really fucked in the head for a few weeks after this trying to figure out why it happened to me. my wife died of cancer at just 44 in 2011, so i was starting to wonder what cosmic force had decided to fuck with me. in the end i decided that would mean believing in ""god,"" so i gave up on that theory. 2) i often joke that i am owed a session with somebody's wife to make up for being attacked for.sleeping with somebody's wife when i actually hadn't. edit: it was broad daylight when this happened."
1444	49997	143	bojhpr	enihbn2	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	many years ago i was driving through utah. at that time one could drive for many miles on the freeway and not see another car. i hadn't seen anyone else for at least fifteen minutes other than the semi truck in front of me. i pulled out to pass and he sped up a bit, with the result that i am committed to the pass just as we cross a bridge with guard rails. he immediately moves into my lane. i'm going to die because i have nowhere to go. i floor the gas and somehow pull ahead. looking back in the rearview mirror he is completely in my lane. there is no way he didn't know i was there. it took me a while to realize that he tried to kill me on purpose. it's possible no one would have known and just put my death down as an accident.
1445	49997	99	bojhpr	eni2omn	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i don't know if this qualifies as a murder attempt but i can say for certain it was a robbery attempt. it happened in chicago during daylight when i was moving some items around for a large photo shoot. stupid me forgot my box cutter so i had a small switchblade with me to open the boxes up. &#x200b; i am walking down the street and this guy who is pretty much my age comes out of nowhere and starts trying to talk to me about some nonsense. i did notice he had his hand clenched as if he was holding something. i tell him i am busy and not interested at which point he puts his arm around my back and and says how about i give what i have on me. &#x200b; by this point i had one of my hands in my pockets with the switchblade open, once he said that i ended up stabbing him twice. the police came out with the ambulance, they put handcuffs on me but ended up releasing when another cop recognized the guy who got stabbed as a known criminal and they just believed my story of self defense and let me go.
1446	49997	94	bojhpr	enihn75	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	my brother tried to kill me. he was in the kitchen and i was in the room attached to it on the computer. he was talking loudly and asked a question, i told him i had no idea and he snapped. yelled that he was talking to himself not me and to shut up etc. he grabbed a pair of big scissors, opened them up and said he was going to slit my throat and came at me. i managed to run faster and lock myself in another room. when he was trying to break through it (managed to get a big crack down the door) my parents came home. i was 14, he was 22 or 23. my mom told me if it ever happened again he would get kicked out. so it got completely ignored. when it did happen a second time, all 4 of us kids were playing a game and i was joking around with my sister. he told me to shut up grabbed a decorative sword off his bedroom wall and swung it at me. i moved fast enough it hit my chair and i bolted. i went upstairs and told my parents, my mom stormed off and said 'thanks for ruining christmas'. apparently i shouldn't care that it happened, i should 'get over it'. caused issues between me and my parents, my mom especially. years later i was told, what do you expect he's family. sometimes you let things go to hold the family together. i told her that makes sense for small things, but big things like this just show the kid that they don't matter. how could i ever think i mattered to them when they didn't care or help when someone tried to end my life. ignoring it showed how little i mattered and my whole family made me think i was fucked for not seeing how i should drop it. still have to be around him at times unfortunately.or at least i did until recently. i don't talk to my family any more, shockingly not for that specific reason. since it happened when i was so young, and the way it was handled, i felt like i didn't matter for years. it messed me up big time.
1447	49997	45	bojhpr	eni36ld	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	it wasn't a full on premeditated attempt, or as dramatic as some other stories here, but i was pretty deeply affected by mine. during a suicide attempt 2 years ago, my last so pointed the shotgun at me for a much longer moment than i was comfortable with, and made threatening noises. i just bolted and was outside with multiple walls and corners between us before he could even finish his barely coherent sentence. i was already on the phone with 911, so i just stayed outside in the dark until they arrived. had he come for me, i trusted in my ability to hide, or at least be far enough out of the lethal range of a shotgun to survive, even if he hit me. i have a decent amount of lingering issues from that night i'm still working through in therapy, some related to guns, some related to cops (they searched my home afterwards, made fun of my decor, basically the next several hours sucked and i would love to forget that entire evening ever happened), some related to dating and trusting people in general. pretty normal, i presume.
1448	49997	51	bojhpr	eni9yy7	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i was working at a local grocery store as an assistant customer service associate- i would work early mornings and late nights closing and opening the store. one night i was closing the store and it was about an hour to an hour and a half before closing time- around this time i typically send one of my cashiers to go get carts while i collect registers but this night we were busy and i was stuck on a register so my manager went out to get carts to help me while i was on a register. when he was out there he asked me on my head set if my boyfriend would have left me roses on my car. in response to that, i told him no, because the guy i was dating at the time was at home and didn't have a car. he told me ""huh, that's weird, you have a stuffed animal rose in your car door handle and it has a weird smiley face written on the tag. it must be one of your stalkers"" he said jokingly. but i was wondering who could have left me that- so when it slowed down my manager and i watched footage on the security cameras and we see a car back into the space next to mine- roll down its window- and stick the plush rose into my door handle and speed off. i didn't recognize the car so my manager told me he would walk me to my car when we left. he walked me to my car and i started driving down the road- i got a call from him about one minute later where he sounded frantic saying that the guy who stuck the rose in my handle was waiting in a parking lot across the street and went through our grocery parking lot going about 85 trying to catch up to me and that i was most likely being followed. which is also when my phone died, and i didn't have a charger in my car. i live in a rural country area and hardly ever is anyone behind me by the time i get to my roads to get to my house- i looked behind me and sure enough someone was following me at a strange distance- so, i knew there was an abandoned gas station a little ways down the street so i told myself i'd do a u turn around it and see if the person followed and see if it was the same car. i went around the abandoned pumps and what do you know- it is the same car and he follows me around the pumps too. at this point i want to cry and i'm in a panic. there aren't any police stations near by, my phone is cut off. so, i go about 125 down a windy back road until i can't see him behind me anymore, pull off into some random road, pull into a stranger's house and cut my lights off and wait there for about an hour. i called the cops when i got home and none of them took me seriously and said they wouldn't have been able to do anything about the situation because the person hadn't touched me. a couple weeks pass, and i am out and about to get something for my friend from work's baby shower- i'm at baby's r us and i ran inside and left my window a crack down in my jeep because i knew i'd only be inside for a minute. before i went in i looked at my id and thought that i might want to grab it because i was going to be using a credit card and they might want to see it but i thought to myself ""nahhh if they need it i'll come back out"". turns out, they did need it, so i went out to my car and. my license is gone. and i am very confused. i am an air head and tend to mis place things but i knew i had seen it before i had gotten out of the car- i thought i had gone mad. i brushed it off and just used my debit card instead and honestly kind of forgot about my id and ordered a new one thinking the old one would turn up. fast forward about two days- i had two cops show up at my door. when i answered they asked me if i was ""first middle last name"" and i said ""yes"" and they said ""thank god, we thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere"". at that point i was very confused and they told me that they had arrested a man in ""so and so"" county under some pretty extreme charges and that he had my license and a bunch of photos of me and random stuff of mine on him and in his car during the arrest. i swear i lost all color in my face. they gave me their numbers and said my stuff would be coming in the mail with a deportation officer's number and to give them a call if anything new happens or if i have any questions. i don't know what that guys intentions were, what he would have done if he had followed me home that night and i hadn't noticed, or how long he had been watching me for or following me- but i am so thankful that nothing happened. it wasn't for another month or so of digging that i found out who it had been who had followed me. it was some guy in his late 20's that came into my store often- he'd only ever buy coronas and newport cigarettes and he barely spoke english- he always gave me the heebie jeebies. he had actually come into the store earlier that night- i just didn't know he drove that car. i think about this night/month all the time."
1449	49997	47	bojhpr	enj9utk	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	when i was 20 my good friend (18m) and i were stabbed unprovoked (our perspective). he died within the hour and i walked away with minor stab wounds. we had gone to a small party, 10-15 people, in an apartment during a cold -40 winter day. there were 4 of us. we only knew a couple people there but we got along well with everyone there (so we thought). this party was just a pre-drink before a social which most of us were going to walk to. once we showed up we started selecting music that was playing on a laptop with speakers, so we sort of took over the dj position. nobody was actively djing and nobody objected. turns out one of the girls there didn't like the music we were picking, and she had a male friend with her who was a part of a gang. her and her male friend left the party 30 mins prior to drive to the social. once we left we started walking and we heard a honk behind us. turn around and it's the girl and guy who left 30 mins before. now because it's -40 and we seemed to get along well with them, we assume they are going to offer us a ride. so the 4 of us turn around and 2 of us start to jog over, the other 2 walk. once we were close enough, without a single word uttered, the male grabs my friend by the shoulder and swiftly stabs him multiple times and before i could react he turns to me and stabs me as well. after the trial 3 years later i finally learned the cause of this action. the female told him that we were a part of a rival gang and we needed to be dealt with. all because she didn't like our music. rip josh i'll always love you man and i'll never forget. never.

"i was 17 and the yearbook photographer/editor. a guy i knew who was a freshman came in for a print. to print things, you had to go to printer rooms and have a teacher or verified student do the print job. so he comes in with a jump drive. i pop it in and print it for him, don't even bother checking it, because that's what friends do. help each other print their banned materials, right? well, i pull it out of the printer and he asks me to proofread it. i do, and it's a suicide note. while i'm reading it, he walks up behind me and starts to choke me. i mentioned this in another thread just today, but stupid tv tropes saved my life that day. he choked me until i passed out, then left me there with the note. i woke up and stumbled out of the print room and made it to the room of one of my teachers. he called for help and took me to the office. my father ""opted to not press charges"" and the kid was sent to live with his dad in california to ""work on his mental health."" someone pointed out years later that he tried to make it look like i killed myself, by having me hold the note and print it myself l. i still panic if someone touches my neck and it's been almost ten years. i ran into him years later and it was horrific. i'm living across the country now and still dread seeing him."

1454	49997	152	bojhpr	eni17v2	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was about 11 years old, my step father tried to poison me using tuna helper. i don't know what he put in it but i was sick for days. he would watch me and get angrier and angrier as i got better. during the first few days he would smile from ear to ear every time i vomited or passed out. i know it was just mine because i wasn't allergic to any food, and i was the only one who got sick. he and my mother ate the same thing. this was the one time i know he tried to out right kill me. other times it was just playing, he wanted me to hurt. this time he wanted to really get rid of me. ever since then, i can't handle cold pasta or tuna helper of any kind. my body automatically rejects it if i even try to eat it. i didn't realize what happened until years later, when i talked to the man who i call my father (the step dad after) about when his ex wife tried to murder him. she used arsenic, and he now rejects anything almond or hazelnut automatically, his body acts as if it is trying to be poisoned again. i knew then from my own reaction that he tried to kill me. i knew he hated me. the seven years my mom was with him he abused me in pretty much every way. raped me at 9, prostituted me to his friends at 11. when my mom found out just part of what he had done, he said ""she is the spawn of satan, and it is god's will that i punish her"". this was not a metaphor to him. i am so glad that he was enough of an idiot to not know how much of whatever it was to actually kill me. my worst fear is that he will show up again someday to finish the job. he was never arrested, or anything, because i was terrified to say anything. i was a coward. he is out there somewhere. i have a vague knowledge of where. i just hope he has forgotten about me, but i fear for any other children that are unknowingly put in his hands."

"three really drunk guys tried to jump me and a few of my friends while we were out really late at night. the most aggressive guy kinda singled me out (i think because i was the only dude in our group) and started coming at me from across the street with his fists up. there were two other guys behind him and i couldn't tell if they were going to try to fight me as well. the dude in front was shouting like ""i'm gonna fucking kill you, i'm gonna beat the shit out of you,"" punching every sentence with a choice racial slur. i tried to let him know i didn't want any trouble but he kept coming at me. the dude got within maybe fifteen feet of me and i really freaked out, sorta had a fight-or-flight response. this whole time i'd been holding my pocketknife sorta behind my back- i didn't want to escalate things if i could avoid it. when he got close and i realized he wasn't going to stop i whipped the night out in front of me and just screamed, ""get the fuck back or i'll slit your fucking throat!"" he stopped dead in his tracks and his friends were all ""oh shit he's got a knife! he's just drunk man, we're sorry!"" i calmed down a little bit and told them not to follow us, and we hightailed it outta there. super scary even though it thankfully never got physical. i was seventeen at the time, maybe 125 pounds soaking wet, and i knew the dude would have wrecked me if we actually fought. made me really anxious for a week or so afterwards."
