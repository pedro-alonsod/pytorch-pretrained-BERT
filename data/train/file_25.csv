"had a kid come in for generic upper respiratory virus. asked mom if he was vaccinated, as is routine. she said no. when i asked why not, her response was ""well my boyfriend was vaccinated and he still got meningitis, so they don't even work"" i told her that's the same as saying your friend got bruised by a seat belt in a car accident, so you don't wear them when you drive."
4399	35740	372	br87g0	eobr3ax	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	not a doctor, but a story i heard stuck with me. the head of pediatrics from a toronto hospital (i forgot which one) was giving a talk and told a story about how, early in her practice, she had a little boy in for his scheduled vaccines, and was answering the nervous mother's questions. the mother planned to go ahead with the vaccines, but had heard lots of anti-vax propaganda and so she was worried and had lots of questions. while they were talking, but before they administered the vaccines, the poor little kid suffered a grand mal seizure. it was really bad, the kid ended up getting admitted to the hospital, and suffered a fairly serious brain injury. it occurred to the paediatrician much later that if that seizure had hit 10 minutes later, or if the appointment had been 10 minutes earlier, nothing would have ever convinced that poor mother that it wasn't the vaccine that caused the siezure.

4401	35740	6094	br87g0	eocpjsx	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	4th year med student reporting in. had a rotation with a pediatrician where we ended up in the classic encounter with an anti-vaccination parent. this lady was a conspiracy theory magnet. she casually mentioned everything from 9/11 to chemtrails. of course she loved the idea of the vaccine conspiracy as well, opting to not protect her one year old to stick it to big pharma. i relayed all of this to my attending after my exam (i would see the patient first, gather history and do my exam to present to my attending physician). he got this sort of lazy smirk on his face that screamed watch this. we go back into the exam room and we cover all of the important bits of a well-child encounter. growth charts, behavioral milestones, nutrition, sleep. and then we get to vaccines. she lists approximately 15 reasons why vaccines are more dangerous than the disease they protect against (lol) in addition to the various evils of the pharmaceutical industry. my attending listens quietly until shes done with her soapbox (about one eternity later), and then interjects with: have you considered the possibility that anti-vaccine propaganda could be an attempt by the russians or the chinese to weaken the health of the united states population? in a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, i swear i heard a strange popping noise as her brain misfired. it actually broke her. the allure of the increasingly ridiculous conspiracy theory was just too strong. she ended up agreeing to a modified vaccine schedule. i was flabbergasted. my attending just grinned at me in response. to this day im not sure the medical ethics of the situation are totally palatable, but goddamn the result was amazing. edit: thanks for the internet points, remember folks, its all for the kids.

4412	35740	6884	br87g0	eobgisb	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	in medical school i saw a kiddo whose parents refused vaccines and so when they were given the vaccine refusal form to sign. this form essentially said that the parents understood that refusing vaccines was against medical advice, that their kiddo could get sick from all those preventable diseases, and that the they wouldnt hold the doctor/practice liable for any complications that the kiddo may get from said preventable diseases. this mom pulled out a sharpie and blacked out the part about the doctor not being held liable. the parents thought that wed be cool with them just changing that form just for them and they wanted the doctor to be held liable for their moronic choice. of course this didnt work and they were told to sign the form or they would be discharged from the practice and have to find another. they refused to sign and were told to leave after given a list of other pediatricians in the area.

4426	35740	2476	br87g0	eobnlqs	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	pediatric resident here in the us. our continuity clinic accepts everyone, including those kicked out of previous practices for anti-vaccination beliefs, which is a bit frustrating at times. really, it's a mixed bag for how we can handle these patients. ostracizing the parents is only going to build further barriers between provider and kid, so that doesn't help. frankly, what has worked best in my experience is to try to understand where the families are coming from, explicitly asking what their thoughts are on vaccines to let them voice their (mis)understandings. oftentimes, this is the first time they've been allowed to talk about their questions and concerns regarding vaccines with a trained md that doesn't just belittle them. most frustratingly, it takes patience and time. assessing where they are regarding change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, etc.) helps determine where we are for vaccinating them today, in a month, or in a few months. one thing that i do draw the line on is to make sure that we see these kids more frequently than normal children, as they are at higher risks for illnesses because they are not vaccinated (no room for negotiation on that point). this helps two fold: first, it helps build rapport with the family, but also secondly, if they decide to take a delayed schedule (which is still not ideal, but better than no vaccines), we can eventually catch them up to speed with their vaccinations by frequent return visits. interestingly, it's always the yoga-pant's karen types that are the antivaxxer (or pro-measles as i've been calling them lately) rather than the less educated single mom's on welfare or the recent immigrants that speak no english. ultimately, we're the kids docs and their advocates, and are most effective when we ally with the families (or better put, get the families to ally with us) and do have to be stern after a certain point. it's a mix of being stern, but also compromising to work with families to provide their kids as much and the best (data supported) care as possible.

"this story is going to lose something in print but here goes: &#x200b; was a med student at the time on a ob rotation. was waiting for my attending when he came in and just basically grunted and lightly tapped his head off of his keyboard before beginning to click away. i asked what happened when he explained that the couple that was here for a c-section were refusing vaccinations. now, vaccinating is a topic i have strong feelings about, so i asked if i could go talk to them. he allowed it. i went in and introduced myself (handle is not my real name, obviously) and said i had heard they did not want to vaccinate their soon to be born and wanted to talk about any questions or misinformation they may have heard. this was a mistake. quick picture: young white couple, the father wearing a tank top, backwards hat with an tear tattoo under his eye.you get the idea. he explains ""my buddy out east, he has kids, yo, and they got vaccinated and now they slow"" (like i said, this loses something in print) ""i got other kids and they aint vaccinated and they aint slow. that's proof right there"". i knew what i was getting myself into but continued the conversation trying to let them know the truth about vaccinating. about 10 minutes later of me hitting my head against the wall, i realize there's no way i am changing their minds. so i take my leave. i later come back to help bring the mother in to prep her for the c-section. it was myself and one nurse when the father stops us and says we can't take his wife anywhere without him. i explained it's a sterile environment and once we get prepped i will come out and bring him in. he still refuses and is getting upset at this point which is when he drops the bomb ""if i'm not there, that's when you gunna put the chip in her"". . . i said ""pardon?"" he went on to explain he thought we were going to insert a chip that would control his wife or keep tabs on her or something along those lines. ended up convincing him to wait 10 minutes and i would come get him. it took everything in my power not to write on her arm ""insert chip here"". &#x200b; during the surgery my attending actually ended up convincing him to allow certain vaccinations, i can't remember which but it was a small victory."

4448	35740	281	br87g0	eobrf81	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	"not a doctor but i work it at a hospital. i came to fix a nurse's computer in the er and there was a woman being led out by a pack of half a dozen police officers. she was ranting and raving about how the doctors were killing her baby and she was going to sue the hospital and track down the doctors and have her boyfriend kill them, ect. the whole nine yards. kid was crying in their room and was being restrained by more officers and nurses. kid (who was like 9) calmed down after about 5 more minutes. i asked what that was about once everything calmed down and i was told that the kid got bit by a raccoon. animal control had captured and destroyed a raccoon that tested positive for rabies on the same street that the mother and child lived on only a day or two prior. animal control was actively searching for this raccoon as well since it had apparently just gone up to the house in broad daylight and entered the garage where the kid was playing and bit him before running away. obviously this is an extremely high likelihood of another infected animal and the kid needed the rabies vaccine. well the er doctor had made 2 mistakes. one, he had not initially referred to it as a ""rabies vaccine"" but rather as a ""series of injections to prevent rabies from infecting the child"". most anyone would hear that and suspect ""vaccine"" but apparently the mother had not only never heard of the rabies vaccine, but didn't initially interpret preventive injections as a vaccination either. she was told the boy would need the first injection as soon as possible and since we had the medicine on site we could do it right away. the mother consented to the treatment and the physician made the order and went on to explain the procedure to the mother in greater detail to make sure she was properly informed; which is when the he made his second mistake, which was referring to the rabies injections as the rabies vaccine. the security cameras above the nurses stations caught the details but the mother lost her gourd over this. she screamed at the doctor for so many things. she accused him of trying to deceive her, that she never would have agreed to the procedure if she knew it was a vaccine. she said he was trying to poison her child and give him the autism. she accused him of being a pedophile because he wanted to stick something in her boy. finally she accused him of being racist (all three of them are black). by this point other nurses, in hospital security, and a few actual officers are all at the room. the kid is crying, terrified obviously. the mother wants to take her rabies infected kid home and away from this place of nightmares. to be honest, there are a lot of crazy people in the er and up until this point its all somewhat normal. that all changed when a nurse showed up with the actual rabies vaccine and needle for administration. the previously hysteric mother hit another level when she saw the needle and just straight up attacked the doctor, pounding on his head, back, and shoulders while screaming. i could hear this part all the way down the hall as i was coming to fix the computer. she wasn't even saying words anymore, just screaming. she was restrained by officers who had already called for backup and who arrived slightly before i did to escort her away. since i work in it and not in medicine or legal, i'm not entirely sure what the procedure from that point on was. i did follow up with the nurse a few weeks later who told me that animal control had captured and destroyed two more infected raccoons in the area but were not able to determine if either one was the one who bit the kid. the kid did eventually receive is vaccinations and was doing ok. i wasn't told what happened with the mother. that's my most interesting experience with anti-vax people in general"

"i am not a doctor nor antivaxxer but my parents friends ( which i am also close friends to, plus to their son and daughter) didn't vaxed their children. nothing really bad happened just that their son which is 3 years older then me ( i am 23) got a tick to bite him during a hiking trip. over here ( switzerland) ticks can pass two diseases, meningitis which is vaxable every 7 years afaik and lyme-disease which is not vaxable but treatable with antibiotics. &#x200b; after the tick bit him every sign showed towards a lyme disease infection. the parents decided to not do anything but using homeopathy and stones to ""cure"" it. the problem however is with lyme-disease, it doesn't show signs for ages, even decades. so now chances are that in 10 years from today ( infection happened 7-12 years ago or something) the disease will start to develop and hamper his movement. so back then he didn't really know what he should have done so his parents just ruled over him without giving him the option to go for antibiotics. my only hope is that the disease doesn't develop and he can live in peace"

4481	35740	215	br87g0	eoblau2	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	not a doctor, but have taught one girl who's parents are anti-vax. being anti-vax doesn't just affect health, but it affects a child's social development too. girl was sick for most of her life and missed out on school. therefore, she missed out on socialising with her friends. caused her to be anxious about coming to school and thus caused more absences. apparently her mum would have to drag her screaming child out of the car everyday. the girl becomes very sensitive about jokes children make and parents call in to demand that those who 'teased' their daughter be reprimanded. those peers are talked to and turns out, it was a stupid joke about poo that children her age make. girl couldn't handle being around other children who joked and continues missing out on school because she was being teased. what do parents do? pull her out and home-school her instead.

(we cant btw for anyone that doesnt know) moral of the story though is to keep fighting the good fight! you never know when you might finally get through to someone.

"not a doctor but a parent. when my kids were little, i was active in an online community for parents who were a little more ""crunchy"". i chose this community because i was living in a small, very conservative and right-wing city where i got along with almost no one and this community was welcoming to people from all backgrounds and races. they were also pretty full of drama and had some very opinionated parents. they used peer pressure and pseudo-science to convince new parents to be fairly extreme with their practices or they would shame them. vaxxing was one of those things (along with homebirth, staying at home for one parent, breastfeeding, eating organic foods, etc). there were otherwise lovely parents who were shunned for having a hospital birth, using formula or vaccinating. i can't imagine this online community was too different from many around the country. as a new parent dealing with the stress of having a new baby, not sleeping very much, and having your entire peer group shun you for asking the wrong questions, it's really not too difficult to see why this has spread like it did. my kids are secretly vaccinated. i wasn't willing to take the risk for their sake, but i also wasn't willing to be shunned. i am sure i am not the only one who secretly vaccinated and i wonder if the numbers of vaccinated kids is slightly higher than reported."
