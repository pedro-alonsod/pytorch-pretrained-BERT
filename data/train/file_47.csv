"was working night shift on inpatient service. ed called to admit someone. ""we've got a 17 year old down here with altered mental status. we think he needs to be admitted for eval/monitoring. vss, chem fine, [etc. etc.]"" now. i'm not a pediatrician. i don't do kids. i don't understand why the ed is calling me. but - i'm an intern and it's 2 in the morning so arguing about it is stupid. i headed to the ed. i get there to see a young dude sitting there with his parents. i'll mention that his dad was a full bird colonel and very much fit the archetype, and his mom seemed to fit that type of personality, too. the kid is literally rolling around in his bed, alternating between crying, asking if he was going to die, rubbing his dad's hand, and telling him how much he loved him. i had to sit there, and take a history with a straight face from a 17 year old who kept being distracted by just how much he loved his dad. i think my first question was ""did you take anything, tonight?"" and he was straight up and said ""oh, yeah, like a shit ton of acid. want any?"" i 100% laughed at this statement. his dad was not amused. the patient was discharged the next morning."

"i'm a paramedic but this story is from back when i was an emt (hand-holder, oxygen-giver, bandage distributor). got called at night for a teenage male who had ""ingested mushrooms."" on the way to the call, my paramedic partner was unusually silent. after a while she pipes up, ""i don't get it. he ate mushrooms. like, what.portabellas??"" she grew up very sheltered in the country. so that's how this was gonna go. we get there and the cops walk out a skinny kid wearing only boxers. took some shrooms, first time ever, freaked out and told his parents who called 911. my partner is spinning in circles and asking whether she should call poison control. i help the kid into the ambulance and onto the stretcher, turn the lights down low and tell my partner just to drive to the hospital. the kid is calming down a bit but he's tripping pretty hard. asking if his parents are jesus and stuff like that. this was before smart phones when ipods were the shit. i had one of those radio transmitters you could plug into the ipod and then play music through the vehicle speakers. it had a remote that i carried on my belt along with the clicker for the ambulance. we were going to the hospital, lights down low, just being chill when i remembered what my partner and i had been listening to a couple hours before when we checked our equipment. [thievery corporation.](https://youtu.be/un9tulbhr8y) so i reached down and hit the remote without him noticing. a few seconds go by and he turns to me with the widest eyes i've ever seen. ""whoa. what. is. this. music?"" he was in true bliss. he kept asking me about the music for the rest of the ride. we dropped him off and i wrote ""listen to thievery corporation"" on a sheet of paper and tucked it into the waistband of his boxers. i like to think there's some dude out there from upstate new york who fell in love with thievery in high school but doesn't really know why. edit: yeah!! thanks guys for my first gold/silver after being on here for years. it's also my birthday and you guys just made a ho-hum day great! this happened 13 years ago and i've had many great experiences in my career, but this is still one of my favorite ems stories. i'm happy you all enjoyed it. for those of you new to thievery, glad you found them! also check out cosmic game, radio retaliation and culture of fear. they span so many genres but always bring a great vibe. and their message is pretty on point. one of the few bands i almost never skip."

"i had a patient who had taken an ungodly amount of benadryl in a failed suicide attempt. a lot of people think that since it makes you drowsy, a bunch of it might be able to kill them in their sleep. instead of killing them though, benadryl basically gives you absolutely terrifying hallucinations for like 24 hours or more and then leaves you with the worst multi-day hangover you have ever had in your life. he would not stop yelling and screaming about ""that damn cat poking its head out of the ceiling tiles"" every single time i left the room. he also had short bursts of thinking he was covered in bugs and i would find him stripped naked and yelling into the wall."

"i was a doctor that was on rotation in the emergency department. 33 year old male who was brought in naked by the police, under the influence of suspected mushroom ingestion. he had a bit of trouble understanding why hed been arrested, despite being very aware of the fact that hed been caught galavanting around naked in the rain in a childrens playground. the initial police response had been with two officers, and he told me with glee that they werent able to grab him because he was slippery like an oiled pig in the rain, and the nakedness didnt help with no clothing for them to grab. due to being unable to catch him, they called for dog-squad backup. he recounted with a shit-eating grin how hed hidden inside a giant puddle like rambo and had thrown sticks and rocks to confuse the police dog. following an hour or so, they gave up and reverted to using a search line of ~12 police slowly advancing to find him. eventually one stumbled into this goblins little swamp puddle, and then they took another 15 minutes trying to catch him as he bolted naked around the childrens playground.again. his only regret, despite his wife refusing to come and pick him up from the hospital, was that he hadnt eaten more shrooms. edit: im glad this story is brightening a few days. thank you for the silvers and golds! to his fans: im sure hes somewhere out there to this very day.naked, slippery, and plotting his revenge. edit 2: it's a big no-no, i know-know, but i couldn't resist. i remembered that i took a screenshot of his ""presenting complaint"" when he came into the ed - i needed something to show my future children. don't worry, all identifiable information has safely been removed [slippery, naked silliness](https://i.imgur.com/haxtpeo.jpg). also, fixed the dr who - a lot of concerned bbc fans out there."

2336	44698	2314	bmhq67	emwxeqy	in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	physician here. i have not seen anyone on mushrooms (at least not that i knew of) in the hospital. the drug testing for them is actually relatively difficult and not standardized (or at least it wasn't when i was training). i have seen people whacked out of their minds on pcp. we had a patient strapped down to a bed in four point restraints. this was actually pretty common with some of the violently psychotic patients in philadelphia where i trained. i watched the guy somehow shake the bed to the point where he was able to stand up and waddled forward still attached to the bed in his restraints. as a medical student at the time, i just go out of there and let the professionals work that case. patients on pcp will shatter glass, break bones, etc and feel nothing until they come down. i have also seen a patient with lesch-nyhan syndrome. these patients will disturb you. lesch-nyhan is an enzyme disorder which culminates in extreme neurologic symptoms. these patients are classically known to self-mutilate, gouge their own eyes out, etc. the patient i briefly came into contact with would attempt to bite anyone the moment they walked by or got too close. it was super disturbing because it was completely without malice. this patient was also in four point restraints.
2337	44698	676	bmhq67	emx5itm	in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	okay, so not a doctor and not exactly a great story but stay far, far away from k2/spice/any other kind of synthetic ~~marijuana~~ cannabinoids. i work in the mental health field and nearly all of the staff here agree that they have never seen worse episodes of psychosis than some of the ones they've seen after people take k2 (and these are people who've seen it all: opioids, cocaine, crack, pcp, you name it). stuff like violently throwing their entire body into a wall over and over and over. one person woke up in a psych hospital and couldn't remember anything that happened after smoking k2. they told her she'd stripped naked and was pouring milk on herself in the middle of a very busy street and she was absolutely horrified, mostly because she couldn't remember any of it. people legit trying to eat themselves. seizures and cardiac arrest. the kind of stuff that i would call absurd and unrealistic if it was in a movie. there are hundreds and hundreds of different chemical compounds they can use to make that stuff and they are constantly changing it to avoid it being detectable in drug tests or to skirt laws. because it's not regulated, you literally have no way of knowing what you're actually smoking when you get that shit, but you can almost be guaranteed that whatever it is will fuck up your brain and not in a good way. edit: this post started getting up higher than i thought it would, so i want to add some good information people left in the comments below. u/probablyboobs: adding to that; it's not called synthetic cannabinoid because it has any structural similarities to cannabis (which is not dangerous), but because it interacts with the body's endogen cannabinoid system. in whatever way. that's literally the only similarity, it can affect your body in many different ways and it is dangerous. not comparable with marihuana. u/pounce-a-lot: not only is the psychosis severe, but long lasting. i saw clients who were very young with no psychiatric history, and now they have psychosis that isnt responding to medication because of heavy spice usage. its a terrible drug. \[and i just want to add that the people i work with have also told me the exact same thing.\]

"i used to work in ""psychedelic harm reduction"" at a pretty big, and majorly wild music festival where i live and i have some absolutely bonkers stories. my favorite though is the time i met lars. lars was somewhere in his late 30s, tall, ruggedly handsome with one of those faces that just exudes character. he was dressed like an old-timey prospector and carried a huge, hand-made leather rucksack. lars had hiked in to the festival without purchasing a ticket. he walked 10 hours through uncut woods, hiked over a mountain and then swam across a river just to get there. lars had never taken psychedelics before the night i met him, so of course he thought it would be a good idea to take 4 hits of lsd. security escorted lars into the space (a large, secluded area near the center of the festival full of hammocks, tents, art supplies, snacks and a committed staff of wonderful, caring people), and from the moment he saw me, he was imprinted on me like a baby duckling. he literally didn't leave my side for the next 8 hours as i talked him off the psychedelic precipice. at one point i had to literally go into a porta-potty with him, as the thought of being without me for even one minute was too much for his fragile psyche to bear. lars was, and still is, one of the most interesting people i'd ever met. we talked a lot, and while he mostly went in circles, they were ever expanding concentric circles, and so in time i learned a little bit more about him with each cycle. he had this little hand gesture kind of like little tiny karate-chops he'd do every so often to accentuate a point, accompanied by this kind of ""tch tch tch"" sound. he was very intense, but mostly just wanted someone to see him and hear him. he really needed me to understand where he was coming from, and i was only too happy to oblige him. lars grew up in sweden, and came from a broken home. he was for a time the swedish national youth archery champion. he was also a member of sweden's version of the navy seals, though was very cagey about his time in the service. he left sweden after the death of his mother (this part was unclear, but she was possible murdered by his father) and eventually made his way to canada. in canada he lived the life of a true man of the wilds. he had an old dodge pickup he'd made a custom camper for, and he traveled around the back country, hunting and living off the land. he made literally everything he needed for his life himself. he made bows, he made clothes, he made shoes, he made pots and pans. if lars needed something, there wasn't a damn way in hell he was going to a store to buy it when he could damn well make it himself. he also had a donkey that he sometimes traveled with that seemed to be his one true friend in the world. i found out later that lars is also one of the most amazing landscape photographers i've ever seen. i won't share a link to his work as i don't want to out his real identity, but trust me, the dude's work is fucking spectacular. the way he uses color, and the scenery he finds in his wild-man travels are truly stunning. printed large format, his photographs could easily grace the walls of any high-end gallery, though of course lars thinks selling art for money is unseemly. lars and i spent near 8 hours together, him becoming a little more lucid with each passing hour. he eventually decided he was ready to take a nap in one of the hammocks and after exchanging contact details he thanked me for ""saving his life"" (i did no such thing) and fell into the blissful sleep of a man who'd done battle with his demons and come out the other side mostly intact. i saw lars in the real world a few years after our night together. we'd stayed in touch and eventually he was in the city where i live and we met for a walk. he was just as interesting as i remember, and wanted me to buy this abandoned old hotel he'd found in some small town in the middle of nowhere so he could turn it into an art gallery or something. if i'd had the money i probably would have done it. i assume him and his donkey are still somewhere out there in the wilds as i write this."

"was driving to stinson beach, north of san francisco, on a fine, sunny, summer day. stopped near sausalito to pick up these 2 hitchhikers. this was in 1968. red headed girl with green eyes and wearing a flowery dress , and her diminutive friend, a little red headed guy with fiery eyes. (her brother?). anyway every time we rounded a curve going towards mt. tamalpais, he would exclaim ""far out"" with the new panorama opening up. about halfway there this girl who was sitting in the middle of the front of my ford station wagon, (1969, 429 cubes, indian fire colored with black leather seats) reached into her purse and brought out a little dark brown cigarette. ""are you hip to this?"" she asked. ""i can dig it."" i replied. i took a couple of tokes on this little brown cigarette and suddenly the road turned into a ribbon flowing out in front of us. i was driving about 60 mph and really digging how smooth the ride was. when we reached stinson beach parking lot, the girl said ""you can drop us off here."" i said ""no, i always have to go to the end of the road."" i noticed for the first time ever a voice in my head, a deep toned masculine voice, that asked me ""**why do you always have to go to the end of the road**?"" i was alerted to something being different at that point. when they got out of the car i said ""i hope you have a nice day.""(the expression was fairly new in '69 and had been getting critiqued in the san francisco chronicle by herb caen, who didn't much like the overuse of the expression). she leaned close to my face and said ""we hope you have a nice day."" well she knew what she was talking about i guess. i went to the beach and brought my little transistor radio and my towel and lay down on the beach. i first noticed the music was coming out of my radio in circles, directly into my ears and seemed to go on forever. it sounded wonderful. witchy tai to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg9lt4qr_dw was playing and i suddenly heard the most wonderfully magical sound i had ever heard. i sat up and looked to see what was causing it. it was the sound of some car keys in the hand of someone walking by. i looked out on the ocean and noticed that the breakers were coming in like pink cotton candy. i freaked a little noticing that things weren't real at all. i worried about myself at this point because i didn't know what was in the cigarette that i only took took puffs on. i saw a cop down the beach and considered , for a moment, turning myself in to him. at this point the voice returned in my head and said **""you know what's wrong with you, dude? you don't like people.""** i decided to go the hamburger stand and get some coffee and food, thinking this would counteract whatever i had inhaled. there was a line of 8 or so people. i turned my face away from everyone in line thinking that if they could see it they would immediately know what i was experiencing. oh yeah, almost forgot, as i was walking to the refreshment stand i noticed that i was sort of floating. my feet didn't seem to be touching the ground. while i was in line i accidentally brushed up against the person standing directly in front of me. the physical sensation was like a wave washing over my body and i nearly had an orgasm. i turned to peek at who it was that felt so good, it was a big fat hairy guy standing there. i drank 3 cups of coffee and had 2 hot dogs and went back down to my towel on the beach. my radio was gone. it had been stolen. i don't actually remember how long i lay there but the effects wore off by sunset and i drove myself home. i don't know what was in the cigarette. it smelled like pot, but obviously was soaked in something else. i have asked some friends about it and they said it sounded like pcp or some really good grass. that is my only experience with any hallucinogens this lifetime. i never smoked much pot either. i was a straight up brooks brothers suit, short haircut guy working for ibm as a sales engineer. i am 82 now and living on borrowed time."
