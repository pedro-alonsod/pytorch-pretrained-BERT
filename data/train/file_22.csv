7520	21399	59	bqx0lw	eo9rgqu	what's something you can't unsee once someone points it out?	i once listened to a podcast where they explained the sound from these high budget nature documentaries is implied to be but not actually diegetic. as in, the sound isn't actually the sound that the animals etc are making. that sound is added in post. all those rustling trees and vocalisations are recorded before or after or might even be from animals in captivity, and are put onto the scene. part of this makes sense. you can't record sound with clarity underwater, and you couldn't hear anything in these long shots in real life. once you know this, you will definitely notice. are those animals vocalising too often? why is that tree making so much noise? how did they decide what sound this fish was going to make when it moves? you realise this is as much a constructed experience as any other film.
