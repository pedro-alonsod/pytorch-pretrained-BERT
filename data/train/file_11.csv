5653	31344	7343	bmt72c	emzm1co	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	nearly every single friend i have in college is because one day in my gen-ed health class we had to pick a seat that would become our seat for the semester. when i came in there werent many seats left, and the people i sat next to ended up becoming my best friends and introduced me to all of my other friends in one way or another.

5655	31344	5497	bmt72c	emzkdt3	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my coworker has a big ego and thinks she knows best. we had a patient who received home visits. he had a medical condition that, if observed by a newcomer, might cause alarm, but we were very much informed about it and familiar with it. instructions were that the condition was normal for him, not a concern in itself. one day the patients wife and my coworker seemed to have some kind of power struggle/disagreement about his condition and treatment and the coworker ended up calling an ambulance (for his long term unchanged condition that we were very familiar with.) he was taken to hospital and while there caught an infection. this infection impacted his eating and he lost a lot of weight fast. his condition deteriorated over the next few months and he passed away. honestly it wasnt unexpected that he might pass but it seems the specific scenario it ended up happening in stemmed from that unnecessary hospital visit.
5656	31344	4455	bmt72c	emzo6kj	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i'm alive because my aunt was born. &#x200b; my grandfather was conscripted into the romanian army as a medic, and his unit was one of the many acting as a defensive barrier, covering the nazi supply lines to stalingrad. she was born, and he was called back to bucharest from the front. while he was on leave, the russians launched operation uranus, which decimated the axis forces. he recieved word that his unit had been completely destroyed. he was never reassigned, and in 1948, my mother was born. &#x200b; &#x200b; i'm also alive because a bunch of romanian cows got sick. my other grandfather was a pharmacist, back when that meant actually making medicines, he was also a jew. the town he lived in was largely agrarian, and their cow herds came down with some illness that was killing them. he whipped something up that cured them. the townspeople were very grateful to him. so grateful that when the chief of police heard that the nazis were coming to town to take inventory of who lived there, he came to my grandfather's house with some train tickets for him and his wife. they escaped the nazis, and never got caught. my father was born at the end of 1945. &#x200b; i guess this is the opposite of the butterfly effect, really. rather than one small action blowing up into a much more important chain of events, two hugely improbable events are eventually lead to my birth(and obviously my extended family as well). and now, i run ads on the internet.

5672	31344	4729	bmt72c	emzlwv3	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	this happened two days ago. it was early in the morning and as im about to leave for work when my mom reminded me that i forgot my water bottle on the table while i was walking out. for whatever reason i decided to go leave my backpack in the car and then walk back into the house for the water bottle. well that took about maybe 10 seconds total. it started to rain heavily on my way to work and couldnt see very well but i noticed the break lights of the cars ahead stopping suddenly and some moving off onto the shoulder and decided to slow down and put the hazard lights on for the people behind to slow down. well turns out everyone was breaking because a 4-5 car accident had just happened seconds before. all the cars were scattered across the highway spread across the left/right shoulders and another had hit the crash barrier, basically a total bad mess. the drivers were still in their cars i guess processing what had just happened. after seeing it i immediately started to think that if i hadnt gone back for the water bottle theres a chance that i could have easily been in the accident or at least even closer to it. it tripped me out for the rest of the day.
5673	31344	4948	bmt72c	emzjwig	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	almost everything that has happened in my life for the past eight years is a direct result of me literally flipping a coin to decide between two colleges. i play the sport i do, have the friends i do, am dating the person i am, and very nearly every other aspect of my life, is because a nickel landed on heads.

5675	31344	3543	bmt72c	emzopkc	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my dad raised me to be highly competitive. one day in junior high i tried out for a play but didn't get in. then i saw on the bottom of the cast list that they were looking for a student director to help out. i wasn't particularly interested, but another girl saw it at the same time as me and she did want it. i wanted to beat her. so we both applied and i got it. long story short i was a theatre director for 15 years and have started directing films now (though now i prefer to write). all because of how competitive i am.
5676	31344	1493	bmt72c	emznmst	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my mother had a deaf friend in middle school for about a week until she moved. she had learned a couple of signs and the alphabet to communicate with her. had me a few years later and taught me what she knew. my middle school and highschool had large deaf populations, so i communicated with them with what i knew from my mom. it really fascinated me.decided i wanted to interpret, took asl in highschool, and eventually went to one of the three schools in the country to offer studies in interpreting asl. met my partner, moved in with him and his family, and now here i am. no longer majoring in asl, but because my mom met a deaf girl in fifth grade, i went to my school, met my partner, and found what i really want to do.
5677	31344	5255	bmt72c	emzmm2q	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	just last month, a friend of mine told me a story from his recent heartbreak. he (lets call him mickey) had been with this girl (minnie) for almost 4 years when out of nowhere, she told him she is leaving him and moving out. he had no idea the relationship was in jeopardy, but she dipped. anyway, a few weeks go by. mickey is hanging out with a coworker of his with who he had just recently met and ends up back at his place just to hang out. on the fridge, he sees a note in minnies handwriting. the note detailed several issues in mickey and minnies relationship and so mickey asks his new friend where he found this note. turns out, this new buddy had gone to the same music festival as mickey and minnie a few months prior. the friend had found the note on the ground of the parking lot and thought wow, what a sad and angry note. im going to keep this because its so raw and interesting. the next day, minnie came over to pick up some of her things. mickey produced the note and it led to a long tear-filled conversation about their relationship and what went wrong. they didnt end up back together, because despite the pseudonyms, this is no disney story. however, the resulting discussion helped them both achieve closure in a meaningful way. all because a random coworker found and kept her discarded note in a festival parking lot. edit: a bunch of you are saying minnie was hooking up with the coworker but i can assure you that was not the case. mickey and minnie had never even met the coworker, as mickey and the coworker both work jobs for a massive company and had never crossed paths until well after minnie left. mickey and him had just become friends days after the breakup. as for why he kept the note, hes just that kind of guy. he was moved by the content of the note so he kept it. they werent having an affair or anything - and if they were, thatd be well over because minnie moved to another city the same week she left mickey. dont be too cynical folks. sometimes things just dont work out. edit 2: and for those thinking mickey is partly at fault for the relationship ending and being oblivious to the reasons for her sudden leaving. of course he is. and he recognizes this. he recognizes his role in the situation and doesnt hate her or anything. he just wants her to be happy and is heartbroken over both of their failures in making that happen. hes a good guy, and hes learning. edit 3: for people saying i am in fact mickey, i am not haha im happily married for one year and you could probably comb through my other comments to prove it if you really wanted but that would be boring. however, if you prefer the narrative that i am mickey, far be it from me to dissuade you.

5679	31344	113	bmt72c	emzu89z	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i suffered with ball pain for a week or so to save a life. when i was a kid my family went from the uk to visit my auntie who worked as a nurse in germany. being obsessed with lego at the time i was excited to be getting to go the original lego land in denmark on the friday of the week for the weekend. queue waking up to crippling pain in my groin early in the week. after assuming it was just strain and waitin a few days, on thursday i was given the choice of going to denmark the next day or heading to the hospital and staying. i chose the hospital since i was in that much pain. turns out there wasnt anything to do but take pain killers and chill. when it got round to the saturday my aunt went out to get me some lego to cheer me up. her and my brother stopped at a swimming pool for a while on the way back where she was throwing some of those weight toys that they got from the toy store into the pool for him to dive down and get. some german teenagers were taking the toys so my aunty tried to shout at them in broken german so they left to a deserted part of the pool. next minute they pull out a toddler from the pool, completely unconscious. the life guards apparently had no clue what they were doing and were trying to call an ambulance so my aunt stepped in and performed cpr until the kid got airlifted to a hospital. a week or so later my pain had subsided so we headed back to the pool. a woman came over to ask for some chairs in german and my mum said sorry we are english and the woman asked in english instead. she turned back around and said you wouldnt by any chance know the english nurse that saved a little boy last week? and she replied yes its my sister. the woman said it was all over the local news that this anonymous english nurse saved the boys life, and she wouldnt have even been in the country if we were in denmark at the time, let alone be at the pool, sending away the teens to find the kid and then saving him. i still have never felt more glad to get a pain in my balls.
5680	31344	526	bmt72c	en01wyw	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	when i was at college, i had this buddy who i used to give a ride to and from the campus each day because we lived a couple of streets apart. one morning ive got goldfinger (the ska band, not the bond movie) playing on my cd player in my car. hed never heard them before, really dug it and asked me about them. it was the day before easter break and he was like cool, ill check them out. cut to two weeks later, hes telling me how he has bought all their records, got his long-distance girlfriend into them when he visited her and has basically listened to nothing but them since we spoke about it. i feel good for helping a buddy discover his new favourite band, but think nothing more of it. that summer me and this dude have a falling out (long story, but the tl;dr is that he screwed me out of nearly 1000) and a bit later, i stop seeing him around. after a while a mutual friend tells me hes dropped out and moved away. the next summer, a friend of mine asks me if i want a ticket to see reel big fish that evening. his sister was supposed to go but is really sick and cant. i say sure and tag along. we get there and it turns out the support band is goldfinger, which is pretty cool. so were standing there, having a beer in between bands and i clumsily knock some girl who is walking pasts drink out of her hand. i turn and apologise and offer to buy her a replacement. while were waiting the bar we get to talking and were getting on pretty well. me and my friend end up hanging out with her and her sisters the whole night, having a great time and me and this girl end up exchanging numbers. cut forward again a couple of years. me and said girl have been together basically since that night. were moving in together and its going really great. the night we move in together, were sitting amongst all our boxes of shit on the only seats that are unpacked and i say something like; imagine if i hadnt taken [friends] offer to go to that rbf show that night. wed never have met shes then like not only that, imagine if you hadnt bumped into me and we hadnt got to talking. our original plan that night was to leave after goldfinger played as they were the only band we were bothered about seeing i commented something about how i really liked them or something, i forget what. and then i ask how she got into them and, im paraphrasing but the long and short of it was: oh my sister got me into them. her douchebag ex-boyfriend got her into them. they were long distance while she studied in the us. they used to go to shows together when he would visit. hes actually from round here i think yup. same dude that i used to give rides to. bonus butterfly effect: my buddy who was with me at that show actually ended up marrying the sister in question last year. tldr: managed to set myself and a buddy up with serious relationships, just by introducing some random dude who i used to give a ride to school to a band that i liked. edit: to add clarity to all this, i will say that me and said girl are no longer together - this was all quite a few years ago now. we remain very close friends to this day and were respectively best man and maid of honour at my friends/her sisters wedding last year. shes married to a lovely lady from scotland and has been for 4 or so years now. theyve just adopted their first son. ive been married to my wife for nearly 2 years now. although you could even add that to the butterfly effect of it all, as it was the same girl that got me the job where i ended up meeting my wife. life is fucking weird.

"(obligatory) not my story, but my ex-wife's. we're still friends though. so i think this story takes place in the summer of 2003. might have been 2004, not sure, but i think it was 2003. she was up in cape cod because her grandmother had a house out in eastham. her whole family is up there visiting, her parents, some cousins, a bunch of people. one day she borrows her mom's minivan to drive into boston to meet up with a friend. she's driving back late at night, and the road is pretty deserted. all of a sudden she sees some kind of animal up on the road ahead. she's not sure but she thinks it might be a wolf. she slams on the brakes. i'm talking, shit-goes-flying kind of slam on the brakes. it's scary and chaotic and the wolf, or whatever it is, eventually runs off. she drives the rest of the way to her grandmother's house, and tries to discreetly tell her dad what happened. but the oldsters in the room have cottoned on to the fact that a secret is being shared and they all want to know what happened. eventually the story comes out. my wife's grandmother, who, god love her, would go on to live to the age of 97, responded by saying, ""that's why women shouldn't drive at night."" i found this response absolutely *hilarious* and for years i enjoyed making reference to it at inappropriate times and circumstances. anyway, everyone goes to bed and all seems well. until the next day when my ex is driving the same van back out towards boston. now, cape cod is pretty much a 1-way-on, 1-way-off kind of an island. and i forgot to mention but it's the end of a holiday weekend, i think it was the 4th of july. so traffic is really crazy. eventually she is at a standstill on the main road for so long, she puts the van in park to wait. and then when traffic moves again she can't get it back out of park. like, it just won't shift out of park, no matter what she does. she turns the car off and back on. nope. nothing. so now she has a car in murderously awful traffic, on a road that (if memory serves) only has 2 lanes to begin with, and she can't move. she can't get out of the way. she's stuck and making already bad traffic much worse. she's by the side of the road and people are driving by screaming obscenities at her. and she's thinking, ""believe me, i would *love* to fuck off right about now but this car is broken and i don't know what to do!"" so after what seems like forever, eventually these 2 guys stop to help. and they're trying to figure out what's going on. it's a really weird problem and it's taking them awhile. and the whole time, my ex is thinking, this one guy looks kind of familiar. like, she keeps eyeing him, you know. trying to figure out if she knows him. and if she does, where does she know him from. now, at this point, i'll mention the answer to the car riddle, which the 2 guys sadly never figured out. it turns out, (and i know how crazy this sounds), that the following had happened: when she stopped short for the wolf, a coin somehow got lodged in the cigarette lighter. it eventually caused a short circuit. the circuit that blew was also connected to the gear shifter. so when the short happened, she was no longer able to shift. insane. back to the 2 guys. the one guy notices my ex noticing the other guy and trying to figure out why he seems familiar. and so finally he says, ""do you watch alias?"" and that was when my ex realized that one of the guys who stopped to help her was bradley cooper. unfortunately, selfies weren't really the standard at the time that they are today, so she didn't think to include herself in the picture she took of the 2 guys. but she does have the picture of bradley cooper and his friend, the nice guys who stopped and tried to help her with her car trouble. and she didn't recognize him at all at the time, but much later she realized, from looking at the picture, that the other guy was bryan callen. so, to review, some kind of animal was hanging out in a road on cape cod one night, and as a result my ex-wife met bradley cooper and bryan callen."

5736	31344	14	bmt72c	en04qrh	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i tried to kill myself when i was 14 and was admitted to a psychiatric clinic. because i was a teen i had to go to classes in the clinic. a teacher there knew another teacher of a school he thought i would fit into perfectly. changed school. i felt home for the first time in years in that school. i met my first love there. he helped me get a more positive attitude and essentially helped me out of depression and selfharm. it didn't work out between us but he's still one of my closest friends. most friends i have now plus my taste in music is thanks to him. if i hadn't tried to end my life when and the way i did, i wouldn't have gone to that school, i would probably have a different job, group of friends, taste in music and attitude today. or maybe i wouldn't be here at all because i would've gotten even worse and may not have failed my attempt in the first place.
5737	31344	14	bmt72c	en06mhe	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	tldr; learned programming out of spite which made my career possible &#x200b; i had no interest in computers or it, just wanted to play games (\~1994) but i had a cousin my age and i always was kind of a dick to him and wanted to be better in everything he did (except school in general). once he told me he learned to code in school (basically just copying html and basic) and he was totally into it. i pushed myself hard to learn it too and just kept doing it and showing him all the advanced things i did that he didn't know how to do. forward to 2005 i was still programming and founded a company that still exists today and i make a good living and just built a house last year with my soon-to-be wife.
5738	31344	14	bmt72c	en06tgc	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i got a fortune cookie that sent me to taiwan. i needed direction in life, but since i couldnt talk to my dead father, i went out for chinese food and got a fortune that said to teach is to learn twice. i milked it over and applied for a job at a local language school as an esl instructor. 2 years later, an earthquake hits taiwan and the company asks if anyone is interested in going to taiwan to replace some english teachers at their sister school (they were not killed, they went home). signed up for a two year hitch, got a promotion, then got a wife, a dog, a son and a daughter. because i like chinese food.
5739	31344	30	bmt72c	emznvbf	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	back in 2015, my friend convinced me to try playing destiny. i got the taken king edition ps4 and got moderately into it. january 2016, right before i take a break, i find a really cool lfg group. we clear the raid quick, and exchange friend invites. april '16, one of those guys starts to livestream. i watch regularly because he was really, really good. one of the mods in chat scolds me for an tone deaf joke that i realize and apologize for, no harm done. later this mod casually advertises that her clan is looking for members. i join up, and she becomes one of my closest friends over the next couple months. not particularly exciting in the grand scheme, but i like to tell the story of how i met my bestie through a video game (especially because i may have never met her if that lfg group had been just a couple minutes before or after i looked)

"not entirely sure this counts as a butterfly but past actions made unforeseen future actions possible so here. &#x200b; in elementary school this dumber kid (insults get justified i promise) tried hanging around me. i was everyones friend back then, but oh boy was this kid annoying. lying, saying my name wrong, throwing a fit in class everyday, making the teachers force us to include him, etc. i got him off my back saying something dumb like ""i have a secret strike system where if you mess up i give you a strike, you're on two and i don't want you to see what happens when it hits three, sorry man"". it made 0 sense and i came up with it on the spot but it actually worked after he begged me for a while. &#x200b; fast forward to almost-adulthood, he works the same job as my little step sister. he forces his hand down her pants, she calls me crying about it. i found his snap/instagram, added him on both, called him right up. he admits to knowing my sister. then says they were on a date. then backtracks to never doing anything. then goes to her coming on to him. and i got to say something like ""alright, i've heard enough man. strike three. you remember what that means, right?"" he went silent and hung up, blocking me on everything. &#x200b; maybe the butterfly is that the lack of friends made him a horrible person, but we're adults and that doesn't matter. pulled up to his next shift like wassuh."

"not really know if this can be called as a butterfly effect story, but here goes: i lived in a small apartment when i was still studying and had my own washing machine.it broke down at one point and had to go to a laundromat to wash my clothes, since the technician i called was only able to come and fix it in 1 or 2 weeks.the closest one in my street was closed once i got there and had to walk a bunch of extra blocks to get to the next one.while waiting for my clothes to wash, i noticed i forgot my book and my phone. (i usually put things i need to pack together so i don't forget something, and then forget them all together)because i had nothing else to keep myself occupied i was just looking around at the people coming in and out of the place.that's when i noticed this cute girl coming in. she put her clothes in the washer, walked up to a cash exchange machine when she noticed it was broken.i saw this happening and walked up to her to offer some change.she kindly accepted and started talking afterwards and kinda hit it off. she wanted to give me her phone number. but since i didn't have my phone, she wrote it on a piece of paper. once i got home i grabbed my phone to send her a text to say how nice it was to meet her and if i could take her out sometime. to my horror, i couldn't find the piece of paper anywhere. i walked back to the laundromat to look for it, retraced my route back home, to no avail. in the weeks following i couldn't get this girl out of my head, searching everywhere and feeling angry with myself for losing the paper. i didn't know where she was from, only her first name. this was before facebook was a thing, so i couldn't look for her online. a month or 3 had passed when i got an invite from a friend, who was throwing a huge birthday party. i didn't really feel like it at first, because it was in a another city about 4 hours away. eventually i decided to take the train instead and spend the night there. i did have to switch trains in a small city about halfway the trip. while boarding the second train i was stunned to see her sitting on this very same wagon, reading a book. overexcited, i walked up to her to say hi. she said hi back but immediately got back to her book, kind of ignoring me. stunned, i walked back to my seat feeling absolutely horrible. thinking that she was mad that i didn't text or call her back. judging by the look she gave me, i assumed i had no chance of redeeming myself. i sat there for the next 2 hours pondering myself what to do. &#x200b; before i knew it we arrived at the final station and she disappeared in the crowd before i had a second chance to talk to her. i almost felt ill with remorse blowing it again. &#x200b; i got the motel, dropped of my bag and straightaway left for the party. i still felt somber when i got there and after saying hello to my friend, immediately went to the bar to get myself a strong drink and try to clear my head. that's when i heard someone behind me say ""you have no idea how sorry i am for not recognizing you !"".i turned around and there she was, actually looking happy to see me. i explained i had lost her number and spent days looking for it. being all caught up in her book, and me having my beard grown out a bit and wearing a thick scarf was the reason she didn't recognize me on the train. she did tell me she felt sad for never getting a text or a call and gave me some playful crap about it. it turned out she and my friend who threw the party used to work together during summers. we spent the whole time talking at the party and continued all night after she followed me to my motel room. (no, just talking) in the end i put her number in my phone, emailed it to myself and wrote it on a piece of paper i put in my wallet. just to be sure! &#x200b; to this day, i always wonder how my life would look like if my washing machine didn't break at that exact moment. or if the first laundromat was open instead. or if i didn't forget to bring my book and was to busy reading to notice her. or if.it almost looks like we were destined to find each other. &#x200b; right now, we've been together for 15 years, married for almost 7.bought a house and have a wonderful 5-year-old daughter together. .and she still gives me crap about constantly losing things."

"in high school, i wanted to take french classes but my parents told me to take spanish because i would use it more. &#x200b; i took all levels of spanish in high school, aced the spanish test for college, and got put in the same class as my current boyfriend of nearly 2 and a half years. another butterfly effect that adds on to the previous thing: my older brother came home on spring break from college and asked if i would like to play dungeons & dragons. i obliged, loved it, and played it more in college. it helped me get out of my shell, meet the awesome people that are now like family, and helped me get to know my current boyfriend. &#x200b; hold on, it gets crazier (bear with me, lol). &#x200b; i had a friend from high school, let's call him d. d hung out with me and we played halo, but i needed to go over to my brother's apartment to use his washer (free washers are better than $2 ones in college). my brother was busy at the time, so we left to go to d's dorm and play pokemon monopoly with him and his friends. when pokemon monopoly ended, i started up a game of d&d and my current bf (who was basically a stranger at the time) brought out his mat so i could use it to dm. d and i aren't friends now (he turned into a ""nice guy"" after i started dating) but it's crazy how all of these coincidences happened. &#x200b; &#x200b; if i hadn't listened to my parents, played d&d, or hung out with a former friend, i wouldn't know my current boyfriend existed. it's crazy to think how some really specific events (the certain day we hung out or me playing d&d with my brother) led me to such an amazing person. &#x200b; it's weird because in the spanish class, we would never talk, but we saw each other every weekday. we actually spoke to each other first when i played d&d with him, and then we talked more. to add onto this, he introduced me to larping and amtgard, so if it weren't for all the previous things i wouldn't have been able to meet the huge circle of people i know now (including the guy who got us together, haha). so yeah, huge and oddly specific butterfly effect for this one :p"
