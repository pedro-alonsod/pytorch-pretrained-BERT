4075	36634	118	bmac4g	emvjcx2	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	"having a learning disorder or any disorder that inhibits your cognitive function. there is really no way to properly explain what it's like to have minimal visuospacial processing, or no working memory, or a slow processing speed, or any of the deficits that come with it. it's more than ""my brain doesn't work"" or ""i struggle at this."" the best way i can try to explain something like the lack of visuospacial skills is to ask someone how many meters away an object is--but even then, it's not a complete comparison. they still have a rough idea of where that object is, and may be able to roughly translate feet to meters."

4088	36634	739	bmac4g	emvadgs	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	"finally feeling like you are an adult. the best i can say is it does happen, and it happens after the time you get the ""no one knows anything"" epiphany, and it doesn't happen for everyone. but once you get there you know. it's like a general comfort and confidence, but those words mean nothing unless you've experienced what i'm trying to describe."
4089	36634	2028	bmac4g	emv6o43	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	reddit to people that don't use reddit.
4090	36634	127	bmac4g	emvdonh	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	the feeling of being shot. it seems to vary so much person to person if you ever hear/read it described. obviously the location of the bullet wound would be a factor but its something i dont think anyone can understand without experiencing it.

4093	36634	503	bmac4g	emvixj5	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	being in an abusive relationship and not realizing it's abusive. or, realizing you're in an abusive relationship and not wanting to leave.
4094	36634	287	bmac4g	emvnobt	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	adhd. you can tell people how you feel and how your brain works, but its usually met by oh i do that sometimes, maybe i have it? or an awkward laugh and a blank stare because they cant relate. how on earth do i explain the panic attacks, loss of focus, the feeling of spiraling, the loneliness, the hyper focus, rejection sensitivity, heightened feelings (like i really wish i didnt feel my feelings so deeply), etc. its very hard to explain and my fianc is still dealing with trying to understand all sides to it. theres also the desperate feeling of wanting to be normal, and trying to tell myself theres nothing wrong with me.
4095	36634	1483	bmac4g	emvb4m7	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	people look at me funny when i say this, but combat. after i returned from overseas people would ask me what it was like, but i honestly couldn't explain it in a way that they could really understand. the risks far out weight the rewards, but i gather that if you talked to a lot of veterans who saw combat, *many* of them will look upon it almost fondly. there's nothing like it. no amount of skydiving or other extreme sports come close to the exhilaration and rush of being shot at and retuning fire. it's an experience unmatched by anything in the world, where the only difference between life and death is if you're better at making subtle aiming changes. sounds bloodthirsty, and i'm not saying it's a fun thing to kill people or see others get killed, it's just one of those things that you have to experience to really understand what i'm talking about.
4096	36634	103	bmac4g	emvkedl	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	seeing mountains for the first time. pictures don't do it justice. i live in a city no where near mountains, but when i went to alberta last year and saw the rocky mountains from banff for the first time, shit was so surreal and i just can't get over how beautiful mountains are
4097	36634	48	bmac4g	emvvi1l	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	"migraines. ""imagine a really bad headache on one side of your head, behind your eye"" doesn't cut it when you're smelling weird smells, seeing things that aren't there and physically nauseous from a headache. they're the worst and so hard to explain unless you've have one."
4098	36634	186	bmac4g	emvqqr5	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	having milk come out of your boobs. there is no way to accurately describes this to a woman who has not experienced it.
4099	36634	120	bmac4g	emvazr6	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	skydiving. feeling the stomach churning drop and instant spike of adrenaline. followed by the amazing feeling of weightlessness. words could never do it justice.
4100	36634	435	bmac4g	emvk2xr	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	being a parent. you've spent your whole life as half of a parent-child relationship and you think you've got it worked out. hell, you even have a dog and there's \_that\_ relationship. but nothing prepares you for the amount of love, the i-would-happily-die-to-protect-this-creature, and the responsibility. it's amazing and you just don't get it until it happens to you -- at least i didn't.
4101	36634	84	bmac4g	emvcfxv	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	bee stings . been stung 6 times but can never explain how it feels , its always bugged me . &#x200b; edit : wow ! i didnt know other people felt the same ! i just thought i had a really shit memory !

4105	36634	35	bmac4g	emvz0z4	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	what its truly like to grieve for your departed baby. a lot of people sympathize, very few can truly empathize.

4107	36634	183	bmac4g	emv97oh	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	marilyn monroe in movies. in pictures some people don't get why's she so popular. watch her in a movie, you'll know why.
4108	36634	263	bmac4g	emvjv8h	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	okay, disclaimer, dont experience this please. but, a suicide attempt. its really hard to explain what goes on the second before it happens. right before i tried overdosing, i felt extremely relaxed and at peace. its completely surreal. like i said, do not experience one of these, it sucks being in a mental hospital.
4109	36634	166	bmac4g	emv8jnq	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	prostate orgasms for a guy. don't judge before you experience it
4110	36634	31	bmac4g	emw12su	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	"living alone for an *extremely* long time. i've been living alone since i left college - over *forty years ago*. people still comment how great it must be to ""have the house to yourself"". they have absolutely no idea - *no idea* - what's it's like to come home to an empty house and spend the evening alone, night after night. and then the nights stretch into months and years, and then finally decades spent alone. i retired a few years ago so now i'll often go for a few days without talking to anyone. some of the ramifications are just weird - for example my vocal chords have gotten weak from disuse so if i go to lunch with friends then the next day my throat is sore just from carrying on ordinary conversations. anyway this is why i love my dogs so much, at least i don't feel completely alone. people think they do, but they really have absolutely *no idea* what it's like."
4111	36634	135	bmac4g	emv5y78	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	dmt

4114	36634	29	bmac4g	emw7f18	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	before i became addicted to heroin i thought addicts we're just weak. no real man, no good person, no morally sound individual would throw their life away. it should be easy to stop once you take a step back and see what's happening. i had an alcoholic friend who i thought was insane for needing to go to aa. i didn't know what addiction was until i got hooked on heroin. i feel like there's no way to really get it until you're gripped by the power. i still don't think it's a disease but i also don't think that it's caused by stupidity or weakness. it's a scary thing. if i really liked chocolate cake but it made me sick as fuck between bites i'd never touch the stuff, but somehow i couldn't apply that logic to opiates.
4115	36634	28	bmac4g	emw8air	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	broccoli, more specifically after it has been properly cooked. for 25 years i hated the shit. went to culinary school. learned what butter and salt can do. now im like the mother fucking witness to the broccoli revival. also helps i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and now am kept alive by almost vegetables entirely. anyway. broccoli. love you.
