5007	33418	2387	bogywr	enh18zl	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	when i was 20, i was dating a girl my own age and was absolutely in love with her (for a while). for valentine's day, i brought home a large sheet of cardboard from work and cut it into a giant heart. i bought a red sweatshirt and some various paints, and made my most embarrassing outfit to date. i painted the giant heart red and cut out an oval in the middle. i wrote on the heart 'will you be my', then wrote 'valentine?' on the shirt. i painted my face red, stuck it through the hole in the cardboard, and then showed up *at her job* to surprise her. fortunately, she thought it was cute. so did her gay co-worker.

""no man. i'm going to prison. have to report for sentencing tomorrow."" ""oh, yikes. don't mean to pry, what for?"" i totally meant to pry because i wasn't about to have a murderer or some psycho rapist on my bus for nine hours. ""oh. i'm going to prison for this girl. she got caught with a bunch of drugs in her car. i was riding with her. it was gonna be her third strike so. i told the cops they were mine. i love her man. she'll be waiting for me when i get out she says."" hahahahahahahahahaha"

5016	33418	10388	bogywr	enh5w9o	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"a girl was leading me on, but also being obvious about it. i was stupidly believing i could change her ways and get her to actually date me. she had revealed she always wanted a giant teddy bear. so for her birthday/valentine's day i bought a giant bear costume from amazon and like 90 roses. the idea was one for every day i had know her. creepy and cringy af looking back. anyhow, she called me drunk the night before and screamed mean shit at me and i finally broke down and told myself she was a shitty person, because she always was terrible to me and i let myself think i could change that because i was desperate to not be alone. in the end i created a sign that said ""free bear hugs and roses for valentine's"" and wore the bear suit onto our college campus on valentine's day to give away all the roses. it made so many people happy that it was one of the best things i've ever done. so many hugs and girls were crying because they didn't have to feel so alone on a shitty commercialized holiday. it was cool. plus the football players all took a flower and hugged me, which was surprisingly wholesome."

5032	33418	5723	bogywr	engx6by	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"do i have to pick just one thing? **high school:** i had a good job where i could work 40 hours a week and go to school, so i had a stupid amount of money and parents who for some reason didn't pay any attention to what i was doing with it. as a senior, i was dating a sophomore, and her mom told her ""it's not your prom, so i'm not paying for a dress and everything."" i ended up spending well over $1,500 on dress, and hair, and makeup, and shoes, and manicure, and a photoshoot, and a custom made blue topaz pendant with a massive stone i hand-picked to perfectly match the dress she would be wearing. last time i saw that stone it was on a chain around her best friend's neck after we broke up. **college:** girlfriend of several months called me up and was sobbing incoherently. all i could make out between the gulps of breath and wailing was ""died."" her grandmother was not well, and she and i would go visit her from time to time so i assumed it was her grandmother that died. i threw my xbox controller mid-game at my roommate, leapt to my feet and said ""hey man, i have to go!"" once i arrived at her apartment and calmed her down i managed to ascertain that it was not her grandmother who had died, but her goldfish. she said she wanted to have a funeral for her fish. i was.annoyed.but determined to compassionately help her cope because obviously that goldfish mattered to her. i recommended she go get cleaned up and take a hot shower to relax, and while she was in there i called up a couple of my friends, and some of her girlfriends. i had a buddy of mine go to the park at the small campus lake and dig a fish grave, i had her girlfriends take her out to lunch, then i got the floating carcass out of the bowl, wrapped it in toilet paper, and placed it in a jewelry box coffin. we went and had a full fish funeral with music and people speaking and psalm 23 by the lake. afterward, when we were back at her apartment, she said ""i don't know why you did that, we should've just flushed it."" we broke up a few weeks later. tl;dr: i was an idiot who made underappreciated grand gestures edit: my first silver! thanks kind stranger! i'll use it to buy a life insurance policy on my kid's first goldfish! edit 2: my wife is going to be thrilled that my first reddit gold was a story about ex girlfriends. now i have to go figure out how gold works, lol. edit 3: there's some vitriol in the comments toward the bereaved fish owner. this was 15 years ago, most of us are cringy and foolish at times when we're younger. she's a perfectly delightful person, just not the person for me. be kind. "
5033	33418	3624	bogywr	engekke	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	in middle school i dated a guy who carved my initials into his leg. flattering. i guess.
5034	33418	5417	bogywr	eng5kjh	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i made a rap.no, i genuinely am too cringed about it to post it. edit: checked my backups (weren't a lot) didn't find anything. the paper i wrote it down must be gone, this was 10 years ago.also asked my friend who had a studio back in the day (i recorded it there, with horrible adlips) and was quite sure he didn't have the mp3 anymore.
5035	33418	17673	bogywr	engqxog	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	in high school this girl who i was close friends with (but also had a not so secret crush on) told me once how she really loved those huge 7 foot tall teddy bears, so i told her one day i'd buy her one and she laughed, writing it off as a joke. fast forward like 3 years later when we're going to the same local college and reconnected after slowly drifting apart after high school. she tells me one day that she's sick so i do the only logical thing. drive to costco after class, drop 200 bucks on that huge teddy bear, stuff it into the backseat of my tiny honda civic, drive incredibly dangerously since the bear is taking up my entire rear window, then show up at her front door. she says it feels too weird and romantic given our past (me having that not so secret crush back in high school and her having to tell me multiple times that we're better off as friends) so i do the whole drive back and return the bear.
5036	33418	16172	bogywr	engvhj7	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i met a girl and fell head-over-heels for her. she lived in another state, nevertheless, we started a long distance relationship. coincidentally, she had just lost her job, so i sent her money every week. (almost my entire check) and i drove out to see her every chance i got. that autumn i found out she had a boyfriend and was just using me to pay her rent. i was at work when i found out and just left. i had to confront her about deceiving me. i drove 3 hours to her house and by the time i got there, i knew it didnt matter. she wasnt the person i thought she was. i gave her everything i had for nothing in return. instead of being mad or saying something that would win her back i told her that she a horrible person for lying to me; that i hope someday someone hurts her as much as she did me. the next day i went back to my job to see if i could get my last paycheck. my boss took me into his office and laid into me about being irresponsible and failing the company while i was sitting there, i could barely hear him as all i could think about was how stupid i was and suddenly, i started crying. i mean torrents of tears, ugly cry. i must have bawled for a good ten minutes. my boss stopped berating me and silently waited for me to get control of myself. then, in a very sympathetic tone, he told me its ok. i was in love like that once. we all do stupid things in the name of love. try to learn from this. it may seem like the world is ending but its not. youll be ok. then he sent me back to work stating that we never have to talk about it again. (he was a good boss and a great guy.) edit: a word edit2: wow! my first gold! thank you kind strangers!!! im really surprised by the responses. thanks for the encouragement and kindness. and to those of you who share similar experiences - i hope you have learned, as i have, that you are not alone. if your heart was broken, it will heal. to quote a friend - youll be ok i will try to answer some questions here. * this happened almost 30 years ago. * i had just graduated from high school. * she was older than me by several years. * we met through a friend i worked with. he found out what she was doing and told me at work. (probably not good timing!) i freaked and just walked out. * when i went back to work the next day, i was just planning to ask if i could be paid for the hours that i had completed that week. * this was back before direct deposit was a thing. * i no longer work at the company (the boss eventually retired and sold it.) * i gave her money because i was young and stupid. * she weaved tales of woe and i was all too happy to be the hero and save her. * i sent the money via western union (fun fact: if you send a lot of money through wu they will automatically make you a gold member so i got that goin' for me, which is nice.) * there were a lot of red flags that i ignored. the most glaring was that she lied. she lied to everyone. and here was my dumb ass thinking she wouldnt lie to me * it was my first time being in love. i had girlfriends in high school, but i had never felt like i was in love with them. so i had no idea that someone could use that against me. * my boss ended up being like a father-figure to me. gave me a lot of advice and guidance. * i am now married to the love of my life. * i am now a manager and i try to emulate some of my former boss great qualities with the people who work for me.

5039	33418	2428	bogywr	enh2emh	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	a girl who strung me along for like 2 years in high school, admired the nice bowls i was turning on the lathe in woods class. i made her my biggest, and best one yet. like fruit bowl size. took weeks. im convinced it got smashed, because she didnt care about me. it was amazing. cherry, walnut and ambrosia maple. fuck you marrissa
5040	33418	1552	bogywr	engp9sn	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i didn't end up doing it, but my senior year of high school my then girlfriend wanted me to quit marching/concert/symphonic band so that we could spend time together over the fall break. our band was going to perform in the macy's thanksgiving day parade, my parents had already paid $1000 each for the week long trip to nyc for my sister and i, and playing the saxophone was something that i had loved since i was in elementary school. i really considered it but i'm pretty sure even if i wanted to there was no way my parents would let me and just be out 1k.
5041	33418	187	bogywr	engpx9c	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i went up (at that time) the tallest ride in asia where they send you up and drop you straight down. i am absolutely terrified by heights. and no she wasn't impressed
5042	33418	11506	bogywr	engtbzd	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"i was so completely obsessed with a girl that i disregarded my own well being and threw away any chance i had for success. we dated for 4 years while we were in school for architecture. towards the end of our degrees, she started having trouble with her thesis project and asked for help. in what can only be described as a lengthy period of insanity, i decided to stop working on my own projects and focus entirely on her thesis. i did everything for her - designs, drawings, models, and write-ups. her presentation went flawlessly and she had the top grades in her class. as a result of staying up all night for weeks at a time and repeatedly delaying my own work, i failed most of my classes and dropped out of school. she was grateful, and begged me to help her work on her masters degree as well. no problem! got her straight a's and a brand new diploma to add to her collection. she dumped me on graduation day and immediately began a relationship with someone who understood the importance of self-respect. i'm not even mad - it was entirely my own doing, and i learned some valuable lessons. really expensive fuck up though. cost me about 8 years of my life playing catch-up. &#x200b; never put a school relationship before your own success. &#x200b; **edit: for those of you interested in a followup, here is what happened right after that shit show.** &#x200b; after i failed out of school, i tried to re-apply to my architecture program the following year. i got a letter in the mail letting me know that my student loans were in default, and i was ineligible for any financial aid. the news was soul crushing, and i really expected that my life was over. that's when i seriously considered suicide as a way out. &#x200b; in the end, i spent about a year in a complete haze, unable to function properly, not eating and rarely leaving my bed. i ran out savings, lost my apartment and had to move back into my parents house. the turning point for me was when i started speaking openly and honestly with my friends about what i was going through, and i credit them with pushing me in the right direction. i started researching suicide and how to combat negative thoughts, and ultimately came to the conclusion that life is something i want to experience - something interesting might happen eventually, even if things suck right now. &#x200b; to move forward, i embraced the fact that i was at rock bottom and convinced myself that there was nothing more i could lose. while my past self was afraid of failure, the new me said ""fuck it, let's do this."" my mission in life became getting back into school, no matter the cost. so i applied to any job i could, and was fortunate to be accepted at a landscape design company that needed a draftsman. after four years, working 9 hours a day at $12-$16 an hour, i had managed to make enough consecutive payments on my old school loans that they were deemed ""rehabilitated."" please keep in mind that during this time, i was able to live rent free and had minimal payments to bear, so i was extremely fortunate during that time. &#x200b; the last step was signing up for classes at my old school and taking out new federal loans. going back to school as an adult while working full time is tough, but at the same time i feel there's no better way to do it. i had a new appreciation my education, crushed my classes and graduated within 2 years - i even managed to bring my grades up from a 2.7 to a 3.2 gpa. &#x200b; so, that's the basic version of what happened. there's a ton of details i'm leaving out, like but covers most of it. if anyone is going through something similar, just hang in there. there are ways to fix almost any issue if you make the difficult choice to work towards a solution. start small and don't get overwhelmed if you are years away from reaching your goals. time will help heal your pain and you will learn lessons along the way."

5045	33418	512	bogywr	engtjz9	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	dude i knew: his gf of 3 months breaks up with him before study abroad; he says they can do long distance, she says she wants to enjoy her time and doesn't want to date. &#x200b; she goes to europe. he empties his bank account to buy a ticket to europe. he shows up at her apartment (she had given out her address to get 'care packages' from friends/family). she is shocked and freaked out to find him sitting by her front door. she flips out on him and tells him that he cannot stay with her. &#x200b; he had already emptied his bank account so he spent the next week and a half trying to find places to sleep and finally just staying in the airport until his flight. &#x200b; things that seem romantic in the movies are not in real life. knew another dude that drove 14 hours to see his college gf of two months at her family's house in new orleans over fall break. she didn't invite him and he thought she was rude for being upset since he drove so far to see her for the weekend. her family was freaked out since she was a freshman and had a dude follow her for a 4 day weekend.

5047	33418	889	bogywr	engrcpg	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"not me but a friend. when we were in elementary school my friend had a huge crush on this girl. so one day he decides to ask her to be his girlfriend so he brings flowers and a note saying ""i love you, meet me at the basketball hoops"" so he puts the flowers in her locker (we didn't have keys for our lockers) then he slips the letter to her and goes to the basketball hoops, she gets there too, then he asked her out she said no, so out of sadness my friend climbs on a tree and says ""if you aren't going to say yes im gonna jump"". yeah it was still a no and he jumps down on his feet and twists his ankle. she then moved to another city far away. this was in third grade."
5048	33418	2326	bogywr	engricc	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	cool. one i can answer. &#x200b; i had a break up that really hurt me emotionally. another girl comes along to manipulate me. we were together for a while when i decided to enlist to the military. she was upset so she convinced me to get an apartment with her that she could live in while i'm gone. fast forward to 3 months after i left: i found out she opened a credit card in my name ($1000), repeatedly cheated on me and trashed the apartment. &#x200b; this was almost 3 years ago and i'm still dealing with the repercussions. &#x200b; edit: i would say the worse part of all this was the mental aspect of being manipulated. the financial part was bad only because i wasn't making a ton of money before enlistment and not so much after.

5053	33418	3133	bogywr	eng802n	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	when i was around 15 i got really frustrated that a girl that i had known for a while did not want to like me and get together. i was texting her in the middle of class and the teacher made a comment about it and she made me handover the phone and something snapped in me. i threw a chair across the room hit my desk which broke my hand and i broke down crying. i thought about it today and it still makes me cringe sometimes. and i apologized to my teacher and everyone included. the girl is now one of my closest friends! edit: i threw the chair and then slammed my hand into the desk for the people that are confused. sorry english is not my first language
5054	33418	904	bogywr	enggyqy	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	bought her everything and trusted her. i had an ex that constantly made me feel like her life was falling apart no matter how much she tried to get ahead. she would ask for things like cars usually cheap ones so i didn't mind. well 3 cars later the amount was piling up. after the cars i was helping her pay rent because she would tell me someone stole from her or something like that. she never could keep a job and i'd believe her when she would say all the bosses were jerks or sexually harassing her so she was quitting. after a point i was paying for her cable bill while working an average of 65 hours a week to cover everything. she drove a decent mitsubishi eclipse while i drove a run down neon. i trusted everything she said and while i was working every hour i wasn't sleeping she was having sex with every guy she could so they could provide for her as well. i never knew because i didn't listen to anyone who said anything. when she got with my one close friend behind my back i managed to see who she was and we went separate ways. edit: so this got a fair bit of attention. to answer some question i only bought her cheap cars like $500 or less projects or beaters but i got them all running for her. the nice eclipse she had she got using money from her mother and such. as well you all are right to say i was an idiot i was but things are getting better and i don't talk to her anymore. edit 2: silver thank you anonymous redditor finally got something decent from that relationship

"to preface this, im a hopeless romantic and adhere religiously to ""fuck it, whats the worst that could happen?"" i wrote love poems and recited them in shakeapearian fashion for my crush in high school. when that didnt work i wrote her a song and performed it. didnt work either, surprisingly i took piano lessons to get to hang out with this girl, then her girlfriend showed up to practice at one point. i fell in love with a french girl through phone at work, im swedish. she worked second line support and we start flirting for a bit, i say i want to see her and ill come to france, she says do it. i arrive in france, no one at the airport, ring her up she freaks out that i did it and wasnt joking,then ghosts me. still a pretty decent vacation. luckily i have since then learned how to dial it the fuck down"
5056	33418	2639	bogywr	eng7e4s	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	not necessarily for her but i tried to impress a girl at my middle school fall festival when a guy bet me $60 i wouldn't eat a live gold fish he had just won. i did it. it did not impress her.
5057	33418	2157	bogywr	engbqb8	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i saw cuts on the arms of a girl whom i was close to in high school. i tried speaking to her about it and she said i wouldn't understand. but i knew she had no one else to talk to, so what did i do? i tried telling her i would understand and she wouldn't believe me. so i pretended i was also sad and anxious and that. me 'opening up' made her comfortable enough to open up. she was right though, i didn't understand but atleast she had someone to talk to even if i couldn't offer much help. we ended up dating for 2 years after both getting even closer due to all that. anyway, she ended up turning against all her morals and everything she stood for. turned into the people that were making her depressed and cheated on me. anyway, i must have done some pavlov magic because now i actually am depressed. edit: last paragraph made no sense. chabged wording.
5058	33418	104	bogywr	engxyx8	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	not me but a friend of mine travelled halfway across the country to hookup with a girl. transport and hotel ended up costing about 400-500 due to him booking everything last minute and not bother looking for cheaper options. at first i kinda shrugged it off thinking that was pretty stupid but oh well. &#x200b; later he confessed that in total he actually blew about 1500 which was most of his savings at the time. apparently he paid for everything during the few days they were together. &#x200b; i know that people do plently of stupid shit in their 20s but holy fuck

5073	33418	269	bogywr	engqwps	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i've posted this before but still funny to me. dating a gymnast in high school. we go to a park and i see parallel bars that are designed for stretching but i'm convinced i can do a handstand on them because i'm awesome. she keeps insisting they are too far apart but i don't listen. attempt said handstand, they were indeed too far apart so i collapse down jamming my chest past my hands and strain/tear all the ligaments holding my chest muscles to my breastbone. good times were not had later or for a long while after.
5074	33418	119	bogywr	enh6bg4	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"i feel like i've posted this before but the stupidest, lamest, most ridiculous thing i ever did was say ""bless you"" to a girl who hadn't sneezed because i *for some fucking stupid reason* thought it'd start up a conversation. it did. the conversation went ""what? i didn't sneeze"" ""oh. my bad."""
5075	33418	887	bogywr	engm5aa	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i've told this story before, but when i was about 8 years old we took a field trip to the field museum here in chicago. during our lunch break i decided to wander off to the gift shop and see what they had. i had a huge crush on this girl named victoria in my class and i saw this lady bug ring for a couple of dollars. i knew she liked lady bugs and i had money my parents gave me to buy something at the shop, so i decided to buy the ring and give it to her. i was really nervous and kept waiting for the right time to do it. i eventually decided to just go for it and walked up to her near the end of the trip. she was with some of her friends which made me more nervous, but i found the courage to do it. she looked at the ring and laughed. her friends joined her and she then tossed the ring in the trash. i was completely devastated and tried hard to hold back my tears. even though i'm over it now, that completely fucked my confidence with girls for a long time. looking back, i may have embarassed her too giving it to her in front of her friends, which is why she reacted that way, but whatever the case, it's probably the most embarassed i have been in my life.

5099	33418	63	bogywr	engs8oa	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"might not be something too insane or extreme,but: this happened in 2018's st. valentine: at my high school, between every hour, we get a 10 minutes pause and a 20 minutes one ( basically lunch break ). at the time it was really cold and snowy, with the snow being near 1 meter and a half high. through the class' windows you could see the ""violent"" snowstorm easily ( in my country the weather is pretty messed up ). i had a crush on a girl ( and i probably still do ) that's in my classroom, and since high school has started i've been planning to express my feelings about her, i just didn't know how. so, in that day, i decided to go through the snowstorm and buy one rose and wait for her in class as i knew that she wasn't there ( she usually goes out on every pause, especially on the 20 mins one ). those 15-20 minutes felt like more than 30; i had to find my way through the snow to the flower shop. i finally did it: i bought that rose, the biggest and the most beautiful one that was there. i got in class, waited for her with an insane anxiety ( as everyone, almost, in the class, after understanding to who the flower was ment to be given, was cheering on me). she comes, i start walking towards her, with the insane anxiety still hanging there, and i give her the rose, in a pretty ""common"" way, but still elegant. i ask her out to watch a movie together, she says that she will ""probably"" come, but i felt incredibly better and relieved. what happened? she kept postponing our date and we never ended up going out together. i literally prepared myself like 4 times ( 4 different fridays ) both physically ( clothing ) and mentally. she said to me, through someone i know, that she rejected me because of the bullies in my class, as half of the class started making fun of me bringing that flower to her, and that she ""would have liked"" to go out on a date with me. obviously, she didn't."
