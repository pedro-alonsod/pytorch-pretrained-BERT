1929	47328	447	bqc3ib	eo4h6nw	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	a lot of ones from the rise of caesar augustus/octavian. -cleoptra was a slut who became powerful only by sex appeal. contemporary and unbiased sources actually suggest she was rather plain, but it was her intellect and charming conversation that got her power. also, as far as sexual relations go, her affairs with julius caesar and antony, as well as her traditional marriages to her brothers, arent bad compared to the well-known affairs of some other figures, especially antony. defaming cleopatra made her easier to demonize and portray as a seductress ruling over antony, making war easier for octavian. -marcus lepidus was useless. in reality, though he lacked the clout or force of personality that octavian and antony wielded, he was a competent administrator and leader who played a key role in defeating sextus pompey. he was a big enough political threat that both antony and octavian wanted him gone, but couldnt just kill him (he was forced into joining the priesthood as a solution). octavian would rather just have people forget that he wasnt the only true roman option (antony being, semi-fairly, perceived as far too decadent). -sextus pompey was a barbaric pirate king who raped and plundered the mediterranean. the youngest son of pompey magnus was likely a competent ruler, given that he held sicily and sardinia against the triumvirate with no internal attempts to unseat him. he did blockade the city of rome from its grain supply to force the triumvirs to negotiate with him, but the characterization of him as a monster is unfair. -octavian being a great military leader. all evidence points to the contrary: three great victories often are attributed to him, and we shall examine them. at mutina, where pro-senate forces fought mark antony in the chaos after caesars death, octavian was a general, but was subordinate to two other men who did much of the real leadership. these two were killed in battle, however, so octavian gets the credit. at philippi, where brutus and cassius were defeated by antony and octavian, octavians forces were overrun by brutus while, a little ways away, antony destroyed cassius army. when octavians camp was overrun, he was found to not even be present; he had claimed illness the night before and stayed away from the battle. antony had to bring his own troops around to defeat brutus. and finally, actium, where antony and cleopatra were defeated not by octavian, but his more capable subordinate, marcus agrippa. agrippa was known for his engineering and architectural skill, but was also a valuable commander (he was the man who defeated sextus pompey at sea while lepidus took his territory by land). agrippa organized the fleet at actium and was the one to lead them to victory. a lot of this was instilled by augustus rather successful record destroying once he became ruler and no one having enough power to challenge him.

1932	47328	5676	bqc3ib	eo43j19	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	i am from germany and some of my grandparents still believe the stuff they were told about jews by the nazis. like when a jewish person dies on a christian holiday they get hung behind the door and everyone who comes in has to spit on him. it's some vile stuff. i can't believe how they were spoonfed with this in their early years. edit: another one i remember is that they were told that at a jewish funeral, the dead person gets a stone put in their pocket, so if they cross jesus in the afterlife they can throw it at him.
1933	47328	2616	bqc3ib	eo4018f	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	drinking fountains are unhealthy. the bottled beverage industry commissioned and publicized a series of studies in the early 1990s when they decided to get into the bottled water business. the problem was that their largest competitor was free and available in schools, parks, and public buildings everywhere. anyone who took even a semester of biology knows that if you walk around and swab and culture anything, you'll find that it's covered in bacteria. that's ecology on planet earth.

1938	47328	38503	bqc3ib	eo3jg3c	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	many korean people believe that fans can cause death. even my mother, who moved to america in her mid teens, still prohibits me from leaving a fan on overnight for fear of death. there is a conspiracy theory that the south korean government spread this myth as propaganda to prevent energy overusage, but it's origins are unkown. it's strange that many koreans believe this myth considering it is one of the most technologically advanced countries.

1940	47328	21556	bqc3ib	eo3sj5r	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	"when edward bernays, the father of ""public relations"", literally renamed propaganda that we want people to think is not bad to ""public relations"" and ""advertising"", and he literally admitted it in a book he made called ""propaganda"". propaganda is, quite literally, just media that is attempting to persuade you. it might be honest or dishonest, but, no matter what, it is still propaganda."

"msg will kill you and is horrible to ingest, ""i'm allergic to msg"" really, it is delicious and your body produces it naturally while breaking down regular salt. some people do have sodium issues, and it may not be good for them. but that's a tiny micro-percentage of people."

1948	47328	27558	bqc3ib	eo3afex	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	that napoleon bonaparte was short. he was 5 feet and 7 inches tall which might be a little bit on the shorter side by modern standards, but it was around the average height for people back then. the idea that he was short actually came from a british propaganda campaign to mock him.

1953	47328	8918	bqc3ib	eo3syxn	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	autism and vaccines. the original guy wanted to advertise his own vaccine but did not disclose this when he published a hit piece on the mainstream vaccine at the time, in a reputable journal. his alternative vaccine failed, his paper was bashed and ultimately retracted, yet people smart enough to work at google don't vaccinate their kids.
1954	47328	4752	bqc3ib	eo3nnuz	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	the lie that nuclear power is terrible. it is worse than renewables, however instead of chucking huge quantities of dangerous waste into the air like a coal power plant, it can all be contained, and 95% can be reprocessed into new fuel. in the 60s and 70s, a lot of oil giants used advertising to link it's reputation to the very real danger of nuclear weapons, and if this hadn't have happened, global warming would have been much less of an issue. very few people realise that coal power actually causes more deaths per mw than nuclear power due to nitrous oxide emissions, even when chenoble is included in the statistics. edit: a lot of people are saying that nuclear is as good, or possibly better than renewables. i agree that at the moment, for baseline power, it is better, and we should be using it a lot more. in the long term though, i think that renewable are a better solution due to not needing refueling, and needing less oversight (once production of the power plants themselves becomes cleaner and better storage solutions are devised).

1956	47328	5449	bqc3ib	eo3jk77	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	"that monosodium glutamate (msg) is harmful. if such an allergy were ever possible (it has never been proven), you'd literally *die*, because it means you're either allergic to sodium, or glutamate, which are in almost every single food or drink known to man. that listerine invented the term ""halitosis"" for bad breath. they didn't. it predates them *by decades*. it's just something that sounds nice to say because you get to attack a big corporation."

1960	47328	7851	bqc3ib	eo3klpg	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	that a man should spend two months salary for his future wife's wedding ring, which absolutely must be a diamond. screw that, i spent a total of 150 bucks for my wife's ring and she fucking loves it, and it's a sapphire. diamonds are no more precious than any other precious gem, and manufactured gems are way easier to come by, are more perfect, and so much cheaper. as long as it's an actual ruby/sapphire/emerald/etc., it's will be just as good as one dug out of the ground. fake ones are good for a teen gift or just friends kind of gift, but they'll shatter pretty easy compared to the real thing. edit: thanks for the silver, random beautiful person!

1962	47328	18865	bqc3ib	eo3hqwr	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	that the old woman who sued mcdonalds over burning herself with her coffee was just money hungry for clarity: an elderly woman was a passenger in a car, pulled over in the lot to add sugar after getting a coffee and it spilled all over her lap. it burned her really bad and she just set out to get mcdonalds to pay her hospital bills bc they served the coffee way too hot. they ended up launching this whole pr campaign where they smeared this poor lady, even taking out spots in local papers over how silly and money hungry she was. comedians, musicians, and radio hosts made fun of her and made her out to be money hungry instead of a victim.

1968	47328	336	bqc3ib	eo41u97	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	that dandelions are weeds. i recently discovered that these pretty yellow flowers were re-classified as weeds because of lawn culture and some successful marketing by herbicide companies. dandelions have been used in food and medicine for centuries.
1969	47328	8183	bqc3ib	eo3auj1	which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	the war on drugs. prematurely illegalized drugs we didn't understand and hadn't had the chance to do a lot of research on (psychedelics and weed, mainly), and created a blackhole of misinformation and mistrust by the public, as well as removed funding for drugs that now, thanks to private funding, we're realizing can have hugely positive effects when dealing with mental health. edit: wow this blew up, but i'd like to point out that when i said psychedelics i meant more like lsd, shrooms, and mdma because they're showing to be more effective than ssris and other prescribed drugs for mental health illnesses with much less side effects. edit edit: i understand the war on drugs targeted blacks and other minorities as well, but at this point that's well documented and most people know it, but to say it's nothing more is extremely short-sighted. thanks for the silver stranger! wow, and gold!

"the idea that fluoridated drinking water was dangerous was started by the ussr. the belief that hiv was created by the us government was also started by the ussr, but that one's not nearly as popular today. edit: i should clarify, by ""fluoridated drinking water was dangerous,"" they were specifically promoting the idea that it was being used for mind and population control."
