5744	31178	608	bsahi8	eomkkx6	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	don't know how major or interesting this is but in athens in the area of faliro () (which used to be the port of ancient athens before it was moved to piraeus) during some excavations for the construction of a cultural center, a huge cemetery was discovered. an entire year of construction was put on hold (and this is a frequent problem in athens, major construction work running into ancient buried buildings which now have to be preserved). apparently the cemetery is interesting not only because it hosts many dead babies and children, which were buried inside vessels, (infant mortality rate was very high) but also many prisoners and criminals who were executed. there's also a mass grave of about 80 shackled men. it has been speculated the mass grave may be related to cylon of athens, a winner in the olympics and wannabe tyrant, who tried to stage a coup by taking over the acropolis but was promptly chased out of there by megacles (of a powerful athenian clan) and escaped to megara. his followers sought refuge in the altar of athena polias. anyone present at an altar was considered to be under the protection of the gods, and was not allowed to be harmed. they agreed to descend the acropolis afted being promised they would be left unharmed but were slaughtered nonetheless by the followers of megacles, as they considered the men unworthy of the gods' protection.
5745	31178	4912	bsahi8	eom7yaa	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	i'm primarily an egyptologist but i work for a uk regional archaeology crew, and recently they found a specific vessel which was very unusual. its hard to describe but i couldn't find a picture, but it was a smallish clay pot, which had been made on a wheel and was incredibly well-made, but the neck of it was tiny, and it pinched in and out at points. bad description i know. anyway, we got it dated to around the stuart era, and gave it over to a potter who we sometimes worked with, so he could attempt to make a copy. he couldn't do it. he made a lovely pot, but it was nothing like the original. he explained that he couldn't get the clay thin enough to pinch like the original, because his hands were simply too big to make a pot with a neck of that size. so after a lot of thought they came to a conclusion that it must have been children making these pots (i suggested women but it turned out even womens hands were too big). based on other circumstantial evidence from the same context, this was from a relatively poor family, who trained their children in the same trade as them to create beautiful pottery to sell to the elites. in the stuart era, that style of pottery was around a lot, but it had started not too far from the city we found it in, so we figured they must have been copying the popular style. it's so interesting to think that a child, probably no more than 8, made such a beautiful piece of work. edit - just adding for clarification as it seems to have confused some people - when i said i'm an egyptologist, i mean that's my main link to archaeology. the pot i'm talking about here is from a regional archaeology find - it's stuart, as in its english and dates from the 15th/16th centuries. its not egyptian, just to clear up any confusion!
5746	31178	7986	bsahi8	eomjr82	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	in my hometown of luebeck in northern germany they found a latrine from the middle-age and analysed the genes of the tapeworms in it or something and apparently that dude that took a shit there has once also taken a shit in england cause his dna has been found in tapeworms there as well http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-10-15-parasites-medieval-latrines-unlock-secrets-human-history edit: btw. there is a weekly podcast about archeology news. it's called [audio news from archaeologica](https://www.archaeologychannel.org/audio-guide/audio-news)
5747	31178	9310	bsahi8	eol6wm2	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	this is more biological anthro/archaeology but recently a jaw bone of denisovan remains was found in tibet which is crazy since those are super difficult living conditions , even in todays lifetime ! ( so far the other remains have been found in siberia ) denisovans have only come up in conversation and discovery quite recently so its always crazy to find any sort of remains. really gives an idea to our development and what we might have evolved from ! edit ; sleepiness and just general dumb-ness led me to adding that denisovans and neanderthals lived in the same area. i included this since the original cave in siberia where the denisovan remains were found, neanderthal remains were also found. this led my little brain to come to this big conclusion which is obviously false so thankyou to everyone who corrected me !

5752	31178	4876	bsahi8	eokzm1k	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	recently a tonne of phenomenal finds have been excavated in britain. examples being a preserved iron age shield found in [leicestershire](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-48377927), which changes how we perceived iron age british tribal equipment in combat, hoping it will open the door to a broader understanding of the military capabilities of this period, and that c14 dating will give us a more specific dating assessment. &#x200b; i've mainly worked in classical greek and imperial roman archaeology and vindolanda is one such site which has been pumping out phenomenal research and artifact findings. being a reasonably well preserved roman fort along hadrian's wall, artifacts are found daily. during the past couple of weeks, finds have ranged from leather shoes, tent canvas, even bathhouse sandals to prevent you burning your feet on the hot tiles. these finds have opened a window of immense understanding of daily life within a roman defensive fort.

5754	31178	3722	bsahi8	eol06ti	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	i'm an archaeologist who mostly works in the private sector. we find a lot of cool stuff, but almost everything we do is classified to some degree or another to discourage pot hunters and vandalism. this year i've found an extension of a really important late woodland (the period right before europeans arrived in america) site, and worked on a very cool 19th century burial ground that had been partially destroyed out of negligence by a construction company, which is a big problem we run into. both sites were super cool, but i can't get into specifics about where they're located! &#x200b; the remains of the last slave ship to smuggle imported slaves into america, after it was outlawed, was just found in alabama. i don't know a lot about it because i'm not an underwater archaeologist, though.

5756	31178	1286	bsahi8	eom8llu	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	okay i've got another one related to my actual degree (egyptology). the tomb of neithhotep was discovered in the early 1900's, but it was badly damaged and therefore we're still investigating all the material we have. a lot of it was burnt by tomb robbers but there is still some epigraphic evidence. one of the most interesting pieces is a tiny piece of pottery with a serekh on it, the symbol of the name of the king. for context, neithhotep was from predynastic egypt, just before the first dynasty. and this is where it gets exciting - neithhotep is believed to be the mother of the first pharaoh of egypt. however, on this piece of pottery, her name is written in a serekh. indicating she was a pharaoh. of course its possible that it was just indicating her as queen, but it's quite fun to think that there's a very good chance the first pharaoh of egypt was a woman. furthermore, as far as we can tell, this is the earliest ever surviving evidence of a woman's name written down. we all thought that was pretty cool.

5759	31178	976	bsahi8	eolgmz6	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	i dont know if its national news or anything but a bunch of fossils and bones of some sort of horned dino were just found on a construction site in highlands ranch, colorado. my cousins boyfriend was one of the workers that found them. some dick on his team was trying to load his truck up with a bunch of the fossils and bones and destroyed them, the museum had to confiscate stuff from him. but its still pretty cool that colorado has another dinosaur! (i think weve had another dinosaur and another really good set of fossils found here.) also, i know this is paleontology and not archeology, but its still cool, and i wasnt thinking about that when i decided to post.

5773	31178	66	bsahi8	eomyb3k	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	i'm surprised at the mass amount of people that haven't heard of the luna settlement in pensacola, fl. it was the first european multi-year settlement in the country and dates to 1559! the story is tragic and we have the unique opportunity to not only investigate the land settlement, but also the shipwrecks right off the coast. additionally, i am working on a native american site across the bay this summer. we are trying to see if natives were present during luna's time here because it appears that the natives just peaced out when they saw his ships rolling up through the bay, which may explain why they didn't help him and his company. very cool history here. highly recommend looking it up.

5776	31178	706	bsahi8	eokwrjb	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	it's difficult to talk about things that have been found in the field, but not formally published. the act of publishing is where all the background information, theoretical models, data collection, and analysis go to offer interpretations of finds found in the field. like, you may have found a tomb, but you can't say much more than it is a tomb, the location, and a general overview of the contents without sitting down and doing the analysis of the mortuary goods, the skeletal remains, and the soils and then comparing all of that to other known excavated tombs to find similarities and differences on a regional, temporal, and/or cultural scale. so as a rule, archaeologists tend not to talk about things they found in the field until they've had a chance to do all that work and get a publication either in the process of being published (review and edit stage) or the publication is scheduled to come out soon in the next issue of a journal. there's a lot more work that goes into archaeology than many people realize. it's not just digging in the dirt, giving what you find a cursory glance, and making broad sweeping proclamations about the past. there's radiocarbon samples, ceramic sherds, chert/obsidian, bones, metal, fibers, soil, pollen, faunal remains, floral remains, etc. that can and is tested to inform us about the dates of occupation, where clay or chert/obsidian sources are located, the dna of a person or the stable isotope value that indicates where they grew up, the sources of metals, what plants or animals make up the preserved fibers, chemical signatures in the soil that may indicate certain kinds of activity, the types of plants being grown nearby, and the animals and plants people consumed. it's a monumental undertaking to do archaeology. that being said, i could talk about some recent work that i've done and presented on at a conference if anyone is still interested.
