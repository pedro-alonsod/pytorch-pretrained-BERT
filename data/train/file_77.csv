2395	44511	46524	bljq8j	empmjfs	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	"i'm not blind, but my wife is. she says she doesn't know. she says she finds me attractive. she just added, ""strong arms. i like feeling the muscles in your arms."" she added that pre vision loss she would have not paid attention to this. she also adds that she can't see me, but can sense when im looking at her lovingly. i told her i was really scowling. i read this to her before posting. she approves."

2397	44511	1914	bljq8j	empu5vd	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i went fully blind suddenly 5 years ago. i didn't really have a type and was attracted to various aspects of the people i dated, but now with the visual aspect removed, i'm attracted to voice, personality, and scent. i'm body positive and enjoy exploring all different body types tactily, but ultimately if my partner has a nice voice, matches well with me with personality and chemistry, and if they smell nice, that leads to full-on attraction.

2399	44511	1587	bljq8j	emptg7z	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	my brother is albino, hes been legally blind his whole life. as a family decision, suggested by a lady whose son also had bad eyesight, my oldest brother, mother, father and myself included would each take turns spending an entire day in his shoes. each sunday one of us would go all day armed with his walking stick and don a blindfold (no peeking whatsoever) doing normal day routines, going shopping, eating out, laundry, dishes, etc. even bathroom time was included. being young i was proud of myself upon completion-high fives and giggles (hard af ill admit, but mom was always near) by the time my dad finished his day his eyes were red and puffy, when he took the blindfold off he embraced my brother for a good while. everyone was silent, watching as my dad held my (then)nine year old brother by the shoulders, bending a knee and with his voice cracking he kept saying im so sorry im so sorry. id never seen my dad cry before, only when grandpa died did i see him just as broken. but i will never forget the day someone cried because they realized how much more terrifying everything suddenly became without the use of their eyes and how they truly empathized. it was just a day for us but this is life for him.
2400	44511	6867	bljq8j	emppqcv	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	"might be too late but why not? legally blind, vision deteriorating throughout my life, got the ""legal"" designation in my early 20s. dating's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but there are a few things that help me appreciate someone intimately: 1. they don't spend the majority of the first date as a ""performance audit"" of how my vision might interfere with dating. it puts me on the defensive since i get half of those questions rephrased during job interviews and medical appointments. we met via [eharmony.com](https://eharmony.com/), not [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov/) =p 2. if they communicate about things openly but know what information isn't important at the moment. if someone goes ""radio silent"" in bed, i have no idea if i'm boring them, if they're unconscious, if they're having doubts about consent, or if i'm missing their favorite spot, and doubt is a hell of a mood-killer. however, if they're saying things like ""a little lower"" or ""don't you dare stop"", you better believe they have my undivided attention! 3. similarly, if time permits, foreplay is often an overlooked form of intimacy. not only is it arousing, but i'm also getting ""the lay of the land"" in the same way i'd use a cane if walking down the street. so yeah, quickies don't always work out if i'm trying to learn the layout of someone who wants to be gone in 10 minutes. don't rush it! 4. not gonna lie: breasts. i might not be able to notice them from afar, but if i'm with someone who's comfortable enough around me, they're my favorite kind of braille. \^\_- i'm open to chat for a while; if there're other questions. otherwise, i hope this helps! edit: my most upvoted comment is now about my sex life. fml. no, seriously, please do. i'm very lonely. i'll settle for a cuddle, at this rate. edit2: and now my first gold! thanks, newly-informed stranger! edit3: as well as platinum! one moment while i curl up in the corner and gibber quietly."
2401	44511	3691	bljq8j	emp2cb8	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	delicious flat chest needs no eyesight to be enjoyed.
2402	44511	215	bljq8j	emq12q0	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	26f here. i am legally blind so i don't know how much my answer counts since i still have some vision (completely blind in my right eye and with glasses i have 20/200 in my left. no clue what it is without glasses), but i will happily give my $0.02. i do have physical things i like (beard, glasses) but i loooove guys with low voices. i also am very aware of how people smell. other than that, it is typical things that both sighted and blind people could say: passion for life, someone who inspires me to be better and get out in the world and challenge myself, someone with a compatible sense of humor to mine. most importantly, someone who is kind and warm. also a dog lover. i have a guide dog. :d
2403	44511	699	bljq8j	empofjm	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	not blind but lived with a blind housemate for 7 years who was bi and kinky as fuck. we're still friends and hang out. most blind people have some degree of sight, she can see screens close up with magnifying software and enjoys watching what she can make out in burlesque videos. we been to a couple of burlesque shows together, she couldnt see shit but she did enjoy dressing up in corsets and stockings for them. she occasionally goes to a fetish night (which is incidently ran by a partially sighted woman! no, it's not a fetish night for blind people, just a coincidence) and my partner has made her costumes for them in the past. i'm guessing the costumes are appealing to her because of the sensation of the fabric or corsetting. she also told me she enjoyed electro sex and flogging when she's doing kink play, as a range of sensations are important to her. we're both sex positive and talk open about sex quite a bit actually. she gets up to some savage stuff, but none of it seems to have much to do with being blind just being a kinky mofo. honestly her kinkiness aside, from what shes told me, her sex life seems pretty much the same as any other bisexual persons i've heard, which is unsurprising as most people have vanilla sex in the dark anyway. i've noticed she is more in tune with sensual rather than visual stuff, like she talks about men and womens builds a lot, prefering lithe people with slender delicate limbs and hands. i guess touch or imagining being touched is more exciting when you can't see where it's coming from so a penchant for delicate hands makes sense. she's a lot of fun and a very happy, positive person. i deeply admire she never lets her blindness prevent her from enjoying things to the max. i've certainly never heard her complain about her blindness. edit: thankyou for the gold!
2404	44511	2251	bljq8j	empd5dz	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	favorite features are being tall with a big ass and thick thighs. bad breath is a deal breaker given my height and sense of smell and no crustaceans should be on the body at all. super obsessive over smooth skin after i was traumatized with getting with this truck stop chick who had the worst case of eczema i have ever felt in my entire life. so in a sense i would say smells in texture come first and then physical preferences come second.
2405	44511	553	bljq8j	empollm	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i like em big, i like em chunky
2406	44511	8060	bljq8j	emphozg	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i'm a bi chick who is blind. things i find attractive include, a) talking to me like i'm an intelligent person and not yelling (you'd be surprised by how many people recognize that i'm blind and then talk to me like i'm mentally slow or deaf) b) if i need help i will ask, please do not treat me like an injured animal in need of care. i promise i live a full independent life outside of our date. c) i may be blind but i still know when you or your place is dirty, please do not use my blindness as an excuse for your laziness d) be descriptive in your conversations and about our environment so i can imagine and relate e) most importantly, be kind and not just kind to me. i hear how you treat others and it matters more than anything else on this list. edit 1: thank you for the gold, kind stranger! edit 2: y'all have a lot of questions. i (and others) have answered some of them already. it's almost midnight here and i have a new job to wake up for tomorrow. i will get back to you when i can!

2409	44511	49	bljq8j	empu619	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	for everyone wondering how a blind person could answer, you may be surprised. this link can answer it better than i can. https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-do-people-who-are-blind-use-computers-and-other-technology/ i worked in a call centre that did tech support for comcast internet (probably 15 years ago). some of the agents, as we were called, were blind. other than a longer delay while they looked up info, or accessed a program, the caller had no idea.

2412	44511	454	bljq8j	empc4lq	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	when my girlfriend reads me reddit posts
2413	44511	31	bljq8j	empzwd1	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	there's a lot of people here wondering how blind people are supposed to answer the question. blind people can use computers and browse the internet without a problem. there's a lot of specialised technology that makes these kinds of tasks more accessible to people with special needs. blind people specifically can read and write on reddit by using text to speech and speech to text programs, braille keyboards and [braille displays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/refreshable_braille_display), among others.

2416	44511	1356	bljq8j	emp8ofr	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i wish you had put a serious tag on this. it could have been entertaining and educational. instead- ive seen 4 comments so far with people making the same shit joke (typing rubbish, because hey, isnt it funny that a blind person might not be able to use a keyboard). touch typing and text to speech are a thing reddit. edit: thanks for the update guys. there does appear to be a marked improvement from last night. i'll check this thread later then i'm not at work. also- rereading my comment made me realise i came across as a right bastard. my apologies- was grumpy from lack of sleep. saw a late night showing of endgame last night. 
2417	44511	22	bljq8j	emqbhpz	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	"real answer, since there are only two damn answers that people are posting, and both are retarded. i have worked with blind people before. gone to school with blind people and done volunteer work with blind people. and i have asked this to several and seen dozens of blind people get asked this. generally, the answer i got was ""voice"" and just ""their attitude"", like are they energetic, bubbly, all cutey, etc. most seeing people are sexually attracted by looking at someome, since it is an easy one sided thing to do. blind people can do the same by over hearing someone talk. they also have have preferences, like ""big tits"" or ""small body"" or ""hairy chest"" or whatever, just like sighted people. but since they can't just see the body, they do not know of them until they get to know the person and find out, or directly ask."

2421	44511	34	bljq8j	emptljc	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	19 / m, blind here. well that depends. when just talking to a person, it's their personality towards me and other people. it's also their voice, if they have a nice, positive voice that's always good. &#x200b; if we're going 2nd base (or further), a \*normal\* body is always nice (idk what's most important for me).
2422	44511	16	bljq8j	emq95cd	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	yall asking how blind people will see reddit? they wont see it. but there are apps and programs that will read pages aloud to them so they can read posts and stories online.

2429	44511	35	bljq8j	empq63l	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i've (m) been totally blind for most of my life (24 now) and i'll try to answer this question. &#x200b; a couple of crossposts from /r/askblindpeople. &#x200b; the sound of their voice particularly when they are enthusiastic or laughing about something, the smell of their perfume/cologne/shampoo, the curves and musculature of their body when your close to them such as when hugging or brushing up against them by accident, basically all of the other non visual cues you already know but almost magnified. it's not super easy, but it does help you become less shallow i suppose. being attracted to personality over looks. though i've met many people with nice voices who i was later told were unattractive so that's not really a good indicator. often, if a woman is wearing heels or has a certain flirtyness or confidence about her, or if i've heard her talking about wearing sexier clothes i can assume she's probably at least decent looking. and what others say can of course be an indicator as well, but it's really never foolproof. i've never personally been close enough to someone romantically to feel comfortable asking to touch their face, and honestly even if i did, i don't know if i'd be able to get much out of it without having touched others to compare. yeah i know what poems and books consider attractive in a human face, but that's only a loose guideline, and doesn't really take into account things like laugh lines, facial expressions, and eye contact. i would probably ask someone i trusted and knew could communicate it properly, then try to get a second opinion. &#x200b; \-------------------------------------------------- &#x200b; as for porn and stuff, there are a few audio porn sites, but they aren't that popular among blind people because the narration usually isn't that great and it takes you out of it. most of us read erotica or listen to regular porn that just has good audio quality, no music, and close up/louder stuff going on. &#x200b; if anyone wants to know more about any fassit of blindness, please check out the faq post on /r/blind and then feel free to ask me anything you want more clarification on here as best as i can.
2430	44511	60	bljq8j	empvaop	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	itt: 95% of people here don't realise accessibility options exist on the internet for the visually impaired. some of them are probably faster at parsing information than you normies, btw.
