485	55698	849	br19bh	eo9ziux	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	the first thing they told us in culinary school when your learning the basic rules for food safety standards is if you enter a seafood restaurant and smell fish, leave.
486	55698	8628	br19bh	eo9v0oz	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if employees try to argue with you about food quality in order to dissuade you from sending something under cooked back, just leave. it means they have a cook who can't take criticism and your chances at getting a sneezer are greatly increased.

"i agree with most of these tips but man i remember my trip to malacca, malaysia. we walked up to a stall where an elderly lady was squatting down just in front of the sidewalk with a plastic basin and washing the dishes in it. stray cats were coming in from the alley and licking at dishes. my first question was is this a *restaurant*? upon closer inspection: yes, it is. my second question was who on earth would eat here??? then our guide brought us inside. looks like: *we are*. food was amazing and delicious and despite fearing the worst, nobody got sick. edit: wow, i didn't realize this comment would be so popular. thanks reddit! to answer the question ""why would you even eat there?"" our trip up until that point had been very well planned. stayed in a great holiday inn with a delicious international breakfast buffet. tour bus was very clean. the highlight of the trip was when they took us to a pineapple farm and we got to sample (hint: supermarket pineapple has *nothing* on the fresh stuff). most of the restaurants we had been taken to were, by western standards, quite clean. this one was definitely an outlier in that regard but by this point we had developed a trust in our guide. i would never have even thought to walk into this place on my own accord, but then i would have missed out on some amazing food. i should post some pictures. pretty sure i have a pic of that cat!"
490	55698	18531	br19bh	eo9yyy3	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	pastry chef here. as much as people say avoid specials, i can't speak for everyone but at least in desserts/breakfast pastries, if you see something new its worth trying. chances are it's something the chef has been working on for weeks on their own time, there's a lot of love and effort put into it. also, the standby if the menu is a book, it's probably not great. the biggest thing to keep an eye on though imo is the staff. if there's pissed off people, get out as fast as you can obviously. if everyone is kinda apathetic and not talking to each other much, get out. that's also a shitty environment, everyone is probably really passive aggressive, and that's going to show. if people seem genuinely good with being there even if it's busy or if there's playful ragging going on, that's where you want to be. the better the staff gets along, the better everthing in the place runs.
491	55698	151	br19bh	eoaa7f7	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	itt: me realizing the 24 hour diner up the street has every red flag ever, but not caring because they have the best omelettes and the best patty melts and i can get both together for under 10 bucks plus the waitress will tell me how much her coworkers suck so i get a little entertainment too.

493	55698	61546	br19bh	eo9onwb	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if a restaurant has a huge menu. its all frozen.
494	55698	27210	br19bh	eo9yyow	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if a restaurant has a one-page menu that's usually a pretty good sign, it means their line cooks have become specialists and can usually nail all the dishes listed. conversely, if a restaurant has a giant, multi-page menu that's a gigantic red flag. the longer the menu the better the odds that you're paying to eat a boiled bag frozen meal.
495	55698	10611	br19bh	eo9uuq6	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef but worked in food a lot. carpet. yeah it's quieter and doesn't get slick, but it is one of the most disgusting things i've ever seen. i saw them pull it up when they remodeled (and put in more carpet). vacuuming only goes so far in a restaurant and i know they never, ever shampood it.
496	55698	23406	br19bh	eo9ejtf	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	pictures of food on the menu that clearly aren't from the restaurant
497	55698	15080	br19bh	eo9oy67	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef, but i just took a chance on a restaurant today and the chefs were sitting, legs up, right next to the front door as i walked in. no one but staff and me there. so, according to how my stomach feels, probably that.
498	55698	29202	br19bh	eo9asf9	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if the area is busy but the restaurant is empty, thats usually a bad sign
499	55698	34759	br19bh	eo9etae	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	when the menus are super dirty and never cleaned, that means everything is super dirty and never cleaned
500	55698	25489	br19bh	eo9hg69	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	cook for a small mexican restaurant here. i always look for how the staff interact with each other. if they all seem to enjoy being there, and coordinate well, more often than not it's because everything is running smoothly and they have a good system, which usually means they know what they're doing and you can expect good food. that's how it always is for the smaller, family run restaurants i frequent anyway, which i believe always have the best food.
501	55698	15268	br19bh	eo9pq7h	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	i have a family member whos worked in multiple different restaurants, and they always advise me never to get drinks with ice because too many places dont keep their ice machines cleaned because its so often overlooked compared to other kitchen equipment.
502	55698	4784	br19bh	eoa3dxt	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"not a chef. front of the house. when my boss (the owner) used to host and people would complain to her about the hour wait on saturday night at 7pm and then threaten to leave, she would tell them, ""if the restaurant you choose does not have a wait on a saturday night, you *may not* want to eat there."" and then turn her biggest shit-eating grin on them :) ""can i add you to the list?"""
503	55698	11010	br19bh	eo9mcnu	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"there's a chinese restaurant in my town with a sign out front that says: ""clean food. and fresh."" i still can't help but wonder why they would bring that up unprovoked."
504	55698	3837	br19bh	eo9swgz	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if you order a meal that should take a long time to cook and it comes out very quickly. its been pre-cooked. edit: this applies mostly to quiet nights. if its quiet and it comes out immediately its just been sitting there. but if its busy than theres enough turnover that its likely alright and chefs are just being prepared.
505	55698	13165	br19bh	eo9wca6	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	we have a sushi place me where the chef gives you free samples of future dishes. this usually means they take pride in their work and want to see peoples reactions before committing it to the menu.
506	55698	2057	br19bh	eo9fzve	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	blood on the vegetables.
507	55698	8441	br19bh	eoa1h0a	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	ive worked in restaurants for over a decade. a couple years in the kitchen and the rest as foh. if your servers response to how is the [item] seems disingenuous, thats a big red flag. we know what goes on in the kitchen, we know the complaints, and we know which items to stress over when we deliver them. servers who pause or seem uncomfortable with that question generally equates to a menu full of stuff we wouldnt eat even as a free shift meal. a good sign is when servers hang out and eat at the restaurant post-shift. generally we are getting a discount but not free food - if we are spending our nightly tips on it, its worth it. edit: woah, thanks for gold kind stranger!
508	55698	5650	br19bh	eo9t71u	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"cook at a fancy casual fine dining restaurant here. if your food is out impossibly fast, it's probably something to be concerned about. i'm talking ordering an entree and it's out in like 10 minutes. this usually means it's already been cooked and they just have to reheat it. now something like a salad, okay that shouldn't take any time at all, but you want to make sure your lettuce (or whatever green it is) is still crunchy and fresh, otherwise it's been made before and has been sitting. generally speaking, watch the wait staff. if the majority of them seem disgruntled or upset, things probably aren't great. this often translates to the kitchen so they probably don't care about your food if they aren't being treated fairly. another thing to look out for is the cleanliness of the place. if the restaurant seems dirty or unmaintained, the kitchen is in similar shape most of the time. i've heard people say ""never order the fish on a monday"" or ""don't get any specials because it's probably product that's about to go bad."" but at my restaurant that's not the case. we get orders all throughout the week and our specials are things we are playing around with to see if it could be added to the menu. so i would say just be cautious about that sort of stuff. also it helps to read reviews. i like to read the one star reviews to see why it was rated that way, if a majority of the reviews are for some really stupid shit, and all the other reviews are great, your likely going to get some kick ass food and service. you all know the ones i'm talking about. some karen who left a one star review because her water ran out once during a huge crunch or something else totally ridiculous. how does the place actually smell? does it smell like good food? then it likely is. does it smell like perfume or to sterile when these is clearly food on the tables? that could be a bad sign that they are trying to hide something less than pleasent. that's pretty much all i can think of at the moment. edit: okay since i didn't make it clear what i mean by ""insanely fast"" and i'm getting a lot of push back. yeah. average ticket time should be about 15 minutes. i was maybe being a bit overzealous with the 10 minute turn around, but i was thinking of large tickets when the place is slammed or it just feels like your food came out very quickly."
509	55698	757	br19bh	eo9xzap	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	i recently went to a new-ish barbecue place. i knew the moment i opened the menu it was going to be awful. the place had at least 120 things on the menu that run the gamut from burgers to lobster thermidor. when you see that, you know it's going to be terrible. it means they're trying to do everything rather than focusing on a smaller range of things and doing it very well. as i suspected, it was terrible.
510	55698	9588	br19bh	eo9kgnz	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if there is different cuisines on the same menu. it usually means it's not gonna be good. i don't trust that people can do japanese and italian in the same kitchen.
511	55698	4260	br19bh	eo9rt5g	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if you walk into a restaurant and hear gordon ramsay yelling at the staff you probably want to leave. unless its one of gordons restaurants of course.
512	55698	1667	br19bh	eo9obdx	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	stay away from buffet and salad bars. a lot of the time it is the same stuff that just gets refilled over and over. super gross.
513	55698	7863	br19bh	eoa169a	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	this is late but i clean kitchen exhaust systems. if you walk in a restaurant and can smell grease walk out. that means the place isnt clean. from the exhaust system to cooking equipment. we clean some places where grease drips off the hoods onto cooking surfaces. edit: for my first ever post this blew up. thank you all.
514	55698	2871	br19bh	eo9lezq	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	waitress here! if you see any food coming out that's messy and theres sauce all over the rim of the plate, etc, it's likely to mean that the chefs aren't putting much effort into their meals and they therefore will not be very good. all the chefs at my work find it so important that everything is presented well and i agree, so if they miss something i'll check the plates and point it out which they always appreciate as it reflects well on them.
515	55698	324	br19bh	eoa15x2	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"there is an abundance of kitchen 'wisdom', popularized by books like kitchen confidential, that isn't always true. ""don't order fish on a monday"" ""specials are made with leftovers or food that's going bad"" ""if the toilets are dirty, the kitchen is too"" ""chefs bleed into your food"" &#x200b; it really depends on the venue. any chef worth a shit is never going to serve bad fish, out of date meat or bleed into your food. the fish thing could be accurate some of the time, but works on the assumption that restaurants have purchased their stock in bulk the previous week, which is often completely false for smaller establishments. that, and the concept of well-done steaks being deep fried or shitty, older cuts of meat may have been true ten or fifteen years ago, but the culinary world has changed so much in the last decade with the rise of cooking shows and celebrity chefs that venues can't afford to cut corners or pull dodgy tactics like that with even mildly clued-in diners that know what they're eating."
516	55698	976	br19bh	eo9r78e	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	its a good idea to avoid restaurants that sound like snapplecheese.
517	55698	479	br19bh	eo9z21d	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	my wife trained as a chef and i cooked in fine dining in college. a long menu is a red flag. if they have 40 different entrees, it means that they are preparing a bunch of frozen ingredients or they have the exact same entree rebranded as a different dish based on the sauce. short menus tend to mean fresher ingredients.
518	55698	260	br19bh	eoa2z43	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"this is the ""prepare to never eat in a restaurant again"" post."
519	55698	2909	br19bh	eo9igrf	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"businesses with a bunch of signs/specials out front. ""lunch special: 4.99$!"", ""free appetizer from 5-8pm weekdays!"", ""bogo main course wednesdays all day!"" that kind of thing. usually means they're going under and are trying to drum up business. unless they're a chain. regular lunch/dinner restaurants that start to offer brunch. #1 brunch service is the worst, chefs hate it, and are usually disgruntled, #2 brunch is a money maker, companies charge over the top for thin pancakes and orange juice with a splash of 4$ champagne. sudden brunch means the place is trying to make more money, charging double and using chefs that don't want to be there. reviews where the owner is arguing with the reviewer. i saw an argument on yelp where a lady complained her chopstick or something was moldy and gave them 1 star. while it was super unfair to give a 1 star over something they didn't do, the owner got into it with her and they started fighting on facebook. owners that are willing to yell at people who are spending their money are likely to treat their staff the same or worse. meaning their employees are either pissed, or the turnover is high and no one is trained well. edit: spelling"
520	55698	110	br19bh	eoaclk0	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"in culinary school currently and every single chef instructor says the same thing, if its misspelled on the menu its on purpose and its so they don't have to sell you the real thing a prime example is ""krab cakes"""

522	55698	1306	br19bh	eo9wde6	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	ive done bartending/waitressing for a few years, heres my list: - first of all, ignore the bathrooms/kitchen thing, the people in charge of the kitchen generally arent in charge of the bathrooms, and its normally the servers job, if the restaurant area is busy were gonna skip that when we can, but well probably give it a quick tidy if we use the toilets. - most places opt for paper menus, because they can just be chucked away afterwards, its cleaner this way, however if the table is sticky (and the restaurant area is quiet) then theres probably a few other sticky areas. - check your cutlery, most cutlery barely gets washed, it gets rubbed with soap, sprayed with water and chucked in a dishwasher, its then meant to be polished with hot water when its brought to the table set up area, this is where we actually check it for leftover grime. if your cutlery is gross, chances are your wait staff arent doing their job properly - dont order fish on sundays, most places get their fish deliveries on a monday and on a thursday, fish goes off fairly quickly and on a sunday its really not great. - if your server has long hair and its not tied up check for hair in your food, kitchens tend to have really strict rules on their staff and you rarely see them with hair down and makeup on, if theres a hair in your food its probably from your waitress. - if your (hot) food is out quickly your chef was probably a microwave - if your server visibly has a cold and is still working, dont eat there, theyre either not paying their staff enough to have days off or theyre forcing staff to work in conditions where they shouldnt be handling food, the kitchen staff probably get the same treatment and probably have the same illness
523	55698	176	br19bh	eoa1sup	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	please god be clever about ordering. if the place is grubby (such as table not cleaned) staff are just sat down in the restaurant, you hear insane shouting from the kitchen etc dont order shit like lobster. ive worked in the industry for 10 years and a year ago went to spain with my boyfriends family. they all decided on a restaurant they wanted to go to. the restaurant was in a busy area but was quiet (red flag 1) the menus were dirty as were the cutlery already laid out on the table (red flag 2- and yeah i asked for replacement cutlery) the there were more waiters than customers and most were sat down one was drinking at the bar (red flag 3) there was about 50 dishes on the menu (red flag 4) and i saw flys all over (red flag 5) i ordered a vegetarian salad because i didnt trust meat from there at all and told my boyfriend he should do the same. he didnt listen, nor did the rest of his family. they all decided to go for chicken or seafood. they spent the next 2 days vomiting. i enjoyed the next 2 days in the sun.
524	55698	4047	br19bh	eo9n8aw	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"this isn't so much about sanitary red flags like most of these, but more about saving you money. if you're goung to get sushi rolls, make sure you read the ingredients. a lot of places have what amounts to a california roll for a premium price. i've told this story before, but it is the best example of what i mean. i worked at a japanese restaurant for a while and we had this thing called a volcano roll and it cost $7.25. a california roll there cost $3.75. the volcano roll was a cali roll cut into the shape of a triangle and topped with spicy mayo that has been heated up with about $.10 worth of fish, literally just a few bits that was not worth it. you are much better off ordering a cali roll and paying $.50 extra for spicy mayo on the side and asking them to heat it up. i had one guy come in with a girl and he ordered a couple of regular rolls like spicy tuna and yellowtail, along with a volcano roll. when served in the restaurant, unless they ask us, we would put the sauce on top so it looked nice, like a volcano. when i brought that roll over he was like, ""oh, i didn't know you guys put the sauce on, i've only gotten it for pick up and the sauce is always on the side. i don't really like it, could you bring me one one without it?"" i tried not to laugh and said sure. i went back and the sushi chef asked what was wrong. i told him that he didn't like the sauce and want one without it. he laughed and said alright, so he took a cali roll, cut it up, and put it on the plate. i brought it back to the guy and he was super pumped. basically this guy paid $7.25 for a roll that would have cost him $3.75 and me and the sushi chef got to split a free volcano roll. normally i would have just told him about it, but the dude was being so arrogant the entire time, i'm guessing to act like he was a sushi expert to impress the girl he was with. i've seen this at a couple of other places too where they slightly dress up a california roll and jack up the price. you don't want to end up like that guy just because you didn't take a few seconds to go over the ingredients."
525	55698	653	br19bh	eo9htu2	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	cockroaches lurking around the place. if you see one, there's bound to be more hiding somewhere.

527	55698	243	br19bh	eo9ytk7	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	used to work in a fancy kitchen. any place that is charging more than $25 for a chicken entree is a goddamn scam.

"obligatory ""not a chef."" my grandfather was a long haul trucker, and always told me on road trips to look for the places truckers congregate. they all talk to each other and will find the best places along the highways. it's worked out for me so far. (edit) so in response, this is for greasy spoon places and i don't count gas stations. also this advice was given a few decades ago so things have probably changed since. still find pretty tasty, horrible for you food, though."
529	55698	230	br19bh	eo9w2z9	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef, more of a foodie. thats what we call fat guys that eat out a lot now. general restaurant condition. if the paint is peeling off the walls, the furniture is all torn up, the place is not cleaned well, etc the food is probably going to be equally shit.
530	55698	1995	br19bh	eo9f0kc	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if there are to many items on the menu. if you have 50 combo choices, man you know half that stuff is frozen, old, canned etc. nothing is gonna be great like an in-n-out burger. it's all gonna be 'meh'
531	55698	91	br19bh	eo9y89o	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	chef here. an easy red flag is an oversized menu or a menu that goes out of the restaurants theme. if the menu is the size of a short novel its very likely your food is going to be subpar. staff demeanor can be a big one but is hard to judge if you cant see the cooks/chef. its not uncommon for places to have lazy servers with a poor attitude but the cooks still rocking it. if you do see the cook though and their demeanor is poor they arent going to care how your food comes out.
532	55698	95	br19bh	eoadtyl	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	one thing i haven't seen mentioned yet: the amount of servsafe certificates posted on their wall. servsafe is a national food safety training course that all managers have to take and pass to become managers. it is required in all food service establishments and for every servsafe-certified employee, there should be a certificate visible to customers(similarly to health inspection). so basically, the more certificates you see, the more employees that work there who truly understand food safety. it's an incredibly tough test and you have to actually understand the material in order to pass.
533	55698	69	br19bh	eo9z7bk	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	check your dishes, cups, cutlery. mood of staff. if it has an open kitchen it's probably half decent. cleanliness of place, clutter, etc. if your plate is hot it doesn't mean your food was microwaved. every restaurant i've worked in has kept their plates in a warming drawer or oven to keep them hot.
534	55698	61	br19bh	eo9utvw	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef but if you see 1 singular cockroach lurking around, theres probably hundreds or thousands of them hiding in the kitchen. also dirty menus and corners that arent dusted are bad signs
535	55698	376	br19bh	eo9kuij	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	i look for dust. dust on the ceiling tiles or in the air conditioning vents. i also have a habit of running my finger along chair frames after i sit down to check for dust.
536	55698	577	br19bh	eo9u6f8	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"not a chef but one that makes me keep driving past is a sign saying ""under new management!"" or something similar. it means the business has already failed (at least) once and either a new owner has come in thinking they'll be able to cut corners better than the last owner, or it's the same owner trying to save face by saying someone new is in charge when there isn't. steer clear of these places. edit: so i realized i was overly harsh with my initial comment and some of the replies had some good points about how these signs could actually lead to positive changes. i was definitely speaking from my own experiences from restaurants that have done this and also ones that my friends have shared in the past. i still believe more often than not there won't be significant changes done to improve these places and that while some people truly mean well, others are just trying to put lipstick on a pig."
537	55698	211	br19bh	eo9tt0h	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef but from personal experience: if its a small chinese restaurant and they have a tank holding live seafood -- **but they dont clean it** -- that place is definitely going to give you a brutal case of food poisoning. if you insist upon eating at such a place i suggest you tip heavily (if ordering to-go) or heavily flattering the waitstaff and/or asking about what's fresh (if dining in).
