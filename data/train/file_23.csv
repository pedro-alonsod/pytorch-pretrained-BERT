2525	43428	494	bq7pbb	eo2aq0l	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	you are not good enough. heard that a lot as child, and now whenever ppl by action or subtly say that i am not xyz it hurts. makes me feel like an afterthought, like i will always come second and no matter what i do i will fail.
2526	43428	811	bq7pbb	eo2mj7p	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	you're going to have to do it sometime, might as well do it now. my dad told me that in middle school after i was complaining about homework, and i've lived by it ever since.
2527	43428	962	bq7pbb	eo2qkoq	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	theres nothing that you can do that will ever make me want you - my mom. so i did what i could to make me want myself.

"my father had been diagnosed with cancer a month after he retired, and as frank turner said 'his weather forecast wasn't looking too good'. i had four kids age 12 and under and was trying to get a new business off the ground, and didn't have much time to see him. one saturday, my sister and mother, who had been providing the bulk of the caregiving, asked me to come for a few hours so they could do some shopping (and clear their heads a bit). i spent the afternoon, and told him i was sorry i hadn't been to see him much. he told me ""your wife and daughters are your family now, and they have to come first. any time you have for me is appreciated, but never fell bad about making your family the priority"". &#x200b; i've carried that with me over the past 14 years, and i always fall back on that when there are conflicts for my time and attention."

2534	43428	1939	bq7pbb	eo28cv0	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	i've always had trouble expressing my emotions. because of this a couple months ago my friends called me an asshole who lacks any and all empathy. that stung quite a bit.
2535	43428	4538	bq7pbb	eo220w3	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	not said directly to me but i overheard some guys on my track team talking shit about me (they didn't know i was standing there). they weren't even friends of mine, but i was doing very well on the team that year and earned a spot on the varsity team which is something that had never happened to me before. these guys were saying i didn't deserve to be there, and that really screwed me up, as i'm a pretty shy, quiet guy and usually don't elicit that kind of reaction out of people.
2536	43428	8807	bq7pbb	eo2ieoo	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	my mom once told me when i was a teenager that it took a lot of courage to take your own life, and you could do a lot with that courage instead of killing yourself. edit: posted this late last night and then proceeded to have a mess of day due to random bad luck, so thanks for the golds and silvers, kind strangers. for those struggling to understand what she meant, i don't think my mom meant to say suicide was a courageous act that should looked upon with admiration. as others here have commented, if you have the courage to die, you have the courage to live. i think she meant to convey that we all have a lot of potential and we all have something to offer, even if we can't see it during the dark times.
2537	43428	18109	bq7pbb	eo2263f	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	my mother once told me i think youve been miserable your entire life, in regards to my depression. it may sound like a horrible thing to hear, but she was not trying to upset me. she was basically saying, youve done everything you can by yourself to try to get out of this depression, but i think its always been there, so you need help.

"my team sergeant was killed in front of me by an ied on my last deployment. he was a mentor of mine and we were particularly close. after we put him on the helicopter, the team commander pulled me aside and told me that ""this isn't the last time this is going to happen. for what it's worth, he thought you were a good nco."" it was hard enough seeing him go, but somehow him thinking that i was good, that he thought i would be alright, made it hurt more. i still miss him. edit - fixed a typo."
2540	43428	5620	bq7pbb	eo2oqqa	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	yesterday is heavy. put it down.
2541	43428	12486	bq7pbb	eo2hybo	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	a coworker once told me all stress is relative. you have no right to undermine what some else is going through, no matter how small compared to your stress i think about it a lot. he was so right, i was young and being an ahole.
2542	43428	11360	bq7pbb	eo2pxx1	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"after the birth of my first child at age 17, my aunt told me, ""this is your responsibility. this child didn't ask to be here. didn't ask for you as a mother, didn't ask for him as a father. it's going to be hard, but it's not his fault he is here."" really made me step up and try my hardest to be a good mother. i hear her voice every time i see a news story about child abuse or neglect. edit: i get back to a gold and two silvers. thank you, kind strangers. "
2543	43428	14798	bq7pbb	eo2e00n	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""i wish you could just stop caring what he says."" my dad, after i got the umpteenth emotionally-manipulative text from my abusive ex-husband (this was over two years after our divorce was finalized). my dad doesn't say much on an emotional level. so when he does say something, i know it has deep meaning. i went no-contact with my ex, and remain so to this day. and i'm a much happier and more serene person for it!"
2544	43428	6708	bq7pbb	eo2gtnh	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	im so proud of you said to me by my swim coach after i came in last, 5 minutes after everybody else. i realized then that nobody had ever been proud of me before for something i didnt succeed in. everybody shows pride when you succeed. when you give your best and come up short anyway, having someone still be proud of your effort means the absolute world.
2545	43428	2938	bq7pbb	eo2okgv	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	me: i don't feel brave. i feel scared. my husband: being scared and doing it anyway is brave. i needed it. he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

2547	43428	6781	bq7pbb	eo20mi6	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""no one wants to be around someone whose sad and blames others all the time"" granted, i was in high school and trying to get attention and some girl said it to me after i was doing my whole ""nice guy"" rant. after that i took it upon myself to change and haven't fallen back into that mindset since. edit* i should clarify, the girl who told me this was someone i had a lot of classes with and we knew one another fairly well. i was being a ""nice guy"" in the sense of trying to be manipulative by trying to get sympathy from them. i thankfully saw how i was acting and did a complete 180 once i realized it. it's been about 15 years and i'm in my 30s now and have been a lot happier and am happily married to a wonderful woman!"
2548	43428	10497	bq7pbb	eo21iel	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""i love you."" my grandma always believed in showing love, not saying it. she believed actions spoke louder than words. four days before she passed away, she told me she loved me. i was shocked at this, but i told her i loved her too. it was so unlike her. i now realize that maybe she said it because, with how weak she was due to the sickness, she felt like she couldn't show it. i don't know. maybe i'll never know. but that was when i knew that she didn't have much time left."
2549	43428	7765	bq7pbb	eo21p3s	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""you have an energy i've always found challenging"" ( by way of saying i dont wanna talk to you anymore) felt like out of the blue. was meant to be kind, i think. fucking ouch."
2550	43428	17569	bq7pbb	eo2dknb	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""i'm proud of you and your brother."" from my dad. he grew up with a conservative, religious, military household. old school mentality of dad works and only is involved in family when it's time to discipline. i was always shy and depressed and hated disappointing him and it came to a point when i started driving and got my car stuck in snow that i didn't want to tell him about it. when my mom told him she made it clear his kids were afraid of him and he realized he had become his dad which he hated. the change has been extreme, from a strict, work yourself to death, hard ass to a family guy. told me on my wedding day that he was proud of me and my brother, because he never heard it from his dad."
2551	43428	7313	bq7pbb	eo29vsw	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"uncle committed suicide when i was a little kid, when i asked my mom how he died she said he was depressed, i asked ""depression can kill someone?"" she said ""it can if you're sad enough"" here i am about 20 years later."
2552	43428	25008	bq7pbb	eo22yd9	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	ive lived a good life. im ready to go. -my grandma who is still physically and mentally healthy. i just wasnt ready for it.
2553	43428	20115	bq7pbb	eo2r0qm	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"not me, but a friend of mine was smoking on a break at work and a woman did the whole ""why smoke? smoking's bad"" thing and he said he just didn't have a good reason to quit, to which she said: ""son, there are people you haven't even met yet who are going to need you here."" i never forgot it. i quit just a month or so after that and i remember it whenever i'm about to do something stupid (so daily)."
2554	43428	20181	bq7pbb	eo2ibv6	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	this happened when i was either 6 or 7. mom: why are you always hugging me? me: cause you're my mom! mom: yeah, or you just want to feel my breasts. 20 years later and that still bothers me, cause that was the first time i ever felt ashamed/dirty but i couldn't understand why.
2555	43428	6117	bq7pbb	eo1v7r3	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	one day, you'll wake up next to the ugly girl you're dating and you'll shame our family
2556	43428	28017	bq7pbb	eo2kqd1	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	never make fun of someones laugh because they will be self conscious about being happy. waking up to gold is a beautiful thing thanks !
2557	43428	5232	bq7pbb	eo21psv	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""nothing is enough for you. never."" my father said it so desperately like he was asking me to stop doing something i never understood he meant. i truly felt so quilty for everything that happened in my family after that, but when he said it i finally understood that my mind and soul were so full of anxiety that i never saw what i had but what i lacked."
2558	43428	12419	bq7pbb	eo2q0mn	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"when i was a little girl, i adored my dad. followed him everywhere, wanted to do everything he did. and i sure tried. he was never great at saying how he felt, but i always remember saying, i love you, daddy. and he always replied, ""i love you, daughter."" when i was a preteen, he had no idea what to do with me, and backed off hard. i was super awkward as a preteen/teenager, and our relationship was super rocky. we had a lot of hurtful exchanges, and i spent as little time at home as i could. in the summer of 2007, i wrote him a letter, telling him that the way he distanced himself from me was hurtful, and that i didn't know how to deal with the harshness of our current relationship, but that i still loved him and wanted to try and move past our painful interactions and rebuild our relationship. he never responded to most of it, but told me he was sorry, and wanted to fix things, too. that winter, he was diagnosed with stage four cancer. i moved home and took over household things, helping deal with doctors, physical therapists, and eventually hospice. my mom was (understandably) a mess, and i tried hard to hold it together for them. things were getting bad, he was fading hard. one night i went in to say goodnight to him, and in a wave of nostalgia, i said, ""i love you, daddy."" he hadn't spoken all day, his throat was dry, he was on massive doses of morphine, but he still whispered back to me, ""i love you, daughter"". he slipped into a coma that night, and never spoke an other word. edit- wow, thank you for the platinum, but especially thank you everyone for all the kind words and understanding. to everyone who is going through this, or feels this pain, you're not alone.  edit two- thanks for all the awards and karma!"
2559	43428	4685	bq7pbb	eo2hmeb	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	never look for happiness in the same place you lost it edit: to the person who gave me platinum, thank you! edit 2: thank you for gold!
2560	43428	32722	bq7pbb	eo1v1m6	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	never grow up, just learn to be an adult. thanks dad
2561	43428	8490	bq7pbb	eo2t6j0	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"i was at an interview recently and there was a young man about my age who turned to me and said, ""hey, bro, can you help me tie this necktie? i didn't have a dad to teach me growing up so i still don't know how to do it."" that really struck a heartstring with me. the fact that this man i barely even knew felt confident revealing something so vulnerable me make me instantly respect him. it was strange but i got the impression that he was someone i could be good friends with. we both got hired. i look forward to working with him soon. edit: many of you were wondering why he didn't google how to tie his necktie. this was a law enforcement oral board exam/psychological interview we were both attending. the academy instructors had pulled us from the auditorium where they were keeping all the recruit candidates so we could get fitted for our bdus, pt gear and polos. as such, we were told to leave all our belongings except the suits on our backs. no phones are allowed in that part of the academy anyway. hope you enjoyed!"
2562	43428	1614	bq7pbb	eo2esqp	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	i dont think youre smart enough for this said my dad in my first week of university. i told him i liked a challenge. now i have my masters degree and im working full-time. at my graduation he told me he was really proud of me and only said it because he knew it would make me work harder to prove him wrong.
2563	43428	4951	bq7pbb	eo231f3	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	my school friends used to refer to me as the friend who eats everyone's food and the one who's gonna be 'forever alone'. i left school five years ago and i still struggle eating around people and believing compliments . . edit: i did not expect so many nice responses, and i'm gonna take everyone up on their offers of food. whilst what i said is sad af, i am a lot better than what i was - a lot of those friends i grew apart from and i'm dating someone who never pressures me into believing his compliments, only accepting that he thinks so regardless of my own thoughts.
2564	43428	4740	bq7pbb	eo2bxfw	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"i was 15(f), and my then-friend-who-i-also-dated-for-a-bit (15m) said two things on two separate occasions. 1. we had just finished a lesson at school, and in the excitement of being free i did a spin, arms out, with this huge smile on my face. ""don't do that, it makes you look really unattractive."" 2. talking about what we liked to do on weekends. i talked about how my family and i loved to go on long hikes in the country. ""oh? then why are you so fat?"" at the time i was a little overweight, but not huge. it crushed me on both occasions. being a teenage girl is hard enough without having a twat for a friend. i'm 29 now so i have the benefit of hindsight but he was vile sometimes. &#x200b; edit: thank you, everyone. i'm keeping every message below for when i'm having a shit day haha. as far as i'm aware he's now a responsible adult. we didn't really stay in touch."
2565	43428	1578	bq7pbb	eo2bzg6	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	your parents may be terrible people, but you are the best of both of them.
2566	43428	2308	bq7pbb	eo2e60i	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"""i feel like you're so used to being treated as subhuman by everyone in your life that you don't know how to handle it when someone approaches you, listens to you, and responds with unconditional care. you expect there to be some kind of catch. you've never felt the kind of love you deserve, so you don't know how to respond to it."" roughly quoted from a friend that was (and still is!) a prominent father figure to me. i frequently apologized for bothering him with my issues or venting out of the blue because i didn't want to bring him down, and he dropped that bombshell as he was reassuring me. really.he's not wrong. i've had girlfriends, best friends, a big loving family.but my closest friends treated me as if i was lesser than them. my girlfriends were either not serious, or downright abusive towards me. my family can basically never know personal information about me because a lot of my major beliefs clash with theirs. every relationship in my life, while i value them immensely, has always had a catch, and i'd never felt like someone has truly just listened to, respected, and loved me with all their heart. he's a remarkable man. thanks to him, i'm a much better person than i would have been had i dealt with all i was dealing with without a role model helping me channel that energy with love and positivity. and thanks to him showing me how to be a good friend, i was able to mend a very, very hurt relationship. i chalk having my best friend up to him helping me see what it means to support somebody, and express my appreciation for them openly and often. it honestly completely changed the way i treated personal relationships, and i thank him every day for it. edit: i definitely didn't expect this one to blow up. i'm sorry to hear so many people can relate to this. you all deserve to have people who love you and care about you unconditionally. you deserve to be heard and you deserve to recover from whatever others have done to you. there are good ones out there. they're hard to find, but you will find them. and they're worth the wait."
2567	43428	2453	bq7pbb	eo23104	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	i think most of the things that have hit me the hardest is just finding out people close to me weren't the people i thought they were, so finding out the truth wrecked me hard.
2568	43428	181	bq7pbb	eo2gy9q	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	some people you meet in life are there to teach you shit and the move along. one of the last things my ex said to me. sometimes i wish she wasn't right.
2569	43428	23985	bq7pbb	eo1wzgx	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	when you find someone better, please just let me down gently.
2570	43428	21944	bq7pbb	eo23cg9	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	what up i got a new phone and went out of state for the weekend on the same day. i tried to activate the new phone but they wouldnt let me until i was back in my home state. on the drive home one of my friends called my brother (who i was with) to get ahold of me and tell me our other friend committed suicide. later that day i got my new phone activated and got a text from the friend that committed suicide that just said what up. he mustve sent it not long before he killed himself not knowing i couldnt text back. i cant imagine how alone he mustve felt. i know it sounds conceited but i cant help but think if i was able to talk to him, maybe he wouldnt have done it. edit: i really hate when people do these but i now somewhat understand why. theres no way i can respond to everybody but ill try because i think it matters. also, really wish i didnt use my porn account for this post.
2571	43428	14483	bq7pbb	eo251we	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	being good to people won't make them good to you. edit: i didn't expect for this comment to blow up or get silver. thanks so much guys. i'd like to add to my comment. though being good to others leaves you vulnerable to being taken advantage of, doesn't mean it's not worth giving certain people the benefit of the doubt. do not let the lack of reciprocation discourage you from displaying kindness towards one another. we are humanity and we have each other. the day is always brighter when you radiate kindness.
2572	43428	15380	bq7pbb	eo1w624	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	we all find you annoying. since then, ive always been the quiet kid. edit: thank you kind internet people for the medals
2573	43428	8660	bq7pbb	eo2cbd6	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"its not exactly earth shaking but i never understood playing games with cheats. from time to time i'd use them but i had friends who'd barely play a game without using cheats. out of the blue, years after i was big into gaming, i visited a friend who was playing gta iv. she was playing with cheats and i asked her why. she says, ""all day i have to deal with consequences, this is the one time i don't have to."" it completely 180'd my viewpoint. i've never had so much make sense, change my opinion, by one simple sentence. she suffers with depression, so for me, it ran a lot deeper than just playing games. it made me think twice about questioning the things people enjoy or how they live their lives. i never thought something so trivial could hold such poignance."

2579	43428	1259	bq7pbb	eo26vwm	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	a friend asked if i knew my boyfriend (now husband) was out if my league. this was many many years ago but since then i have been very aware that i am lucky that my husband even considered to look at me twice never mind marry me! makes me grateful.but i have cripplingly low self esteem about the way i look or come across to others
2580	43428	2276	bq7pbb	eo20ut7	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	i have some ugly ass toes and at the time i wore birkenstocks when somebody said that my toes were disgusting and shouldn't wear my sandals. my toes have not been seen in public since then about 20 years ago. edit: thanks for the great comments. started off as ingrown toe nails (the sides nearly touched) then fungus since i wasn't airing them out on the daily. fast forward 20 years, recovering from a recent illness that made matters worse. it's taken about a year or so for the ick to grow out and plan to have them finally repaired.

"i am probably too late to this, but just in case it helps someone, whenever i suffer from my ""depression phase"" i read the following which someone said on reddit and has always stayed with me. i have literally copied it and pasted it in my google notes and it gives me immense hope to stay alive. &#x200b; >"" i've survived (so far) and a lot of people i've known and loved did not. i've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. i have no children, and i can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. but here's my two cents. i wish i could say you get used to people dying. i never did. i don't want to. it tears a hole through me whenever somebody i love dies, no matter the circumstances. but i don't want it to ""not matter"". i don't want it to be something that just passes. my scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that i had for and with that person. and if the scar is deep, so was the love. so be it. scars are a testament to life. scars are a testament that i can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that i can heal and continue to live and continue to love. and the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. scars are a testament to life. scars are only ugly to people who can't see. as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. when the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. and all you can do is float. you find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. maybe it's some physical thing. maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. maybe it's a person who is also floating. for a while, all you can do is float. stay alive. in the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. they come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. all you can do is hang on and float. after a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. when they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. but in between, you can breathe, you can function. you never know what's going to trigger the grief. it might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. it can be just about anything.and the wave comes crashing. but in between waves, there is life. somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. or 50 feet tall. and while they still come, they come further apart. you can see them coming. an anniversary, a birthday, or christmas, or landing at o'hare. you can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. and when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. take it from an old guy. the waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. but you learn that you'll survive them. and other waves will come. and you'll survive them too. if you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. and lots of shipwrecks.

"my mom use to make me feel like the ugliest and most disgusting human being ever. i struggled with my body image all of my life, and it got worse in highschool. i was never a huge person, i was a little chubby but nothing that i ever found disgusting. i was always picked on for being a little chunky and i always turned to my mom for comfort naturally. she would defend me till i got in to highschool. i remained the same weight since middle school, didn't gain or lose, the usual getting picked on, and my mom i guess got tired of hearing me vent to her about it and she said ""well you know. you really do. if you weren't so fat, no one would pick on you."" and later on after highschool i really tried to lose weight. i wasnt working yet, stayed at home doing house chores but also working out. 3 times a day, an hour each time. i watched what i ate and drank, and i was becoming so proud and happy. go to see family one day, my older brother aproaches us and says ""wow! you look like youve been losing weight!"" mother chimes in with ""um, haha. no. shes still huge. shes not even trying."" she said those words feeling so proud that she just shat on my hard work. it broke my heart. sadly have never had the motivation to try ever since until recently. she seems to be less of an asshole now a days. she tells me shes proud of my accomplishments that i have made so far. makes me feel better about myself atleast. and i am trying again to lose weight with my boyfriend. edit: wow, to the people commenting being supportive of me preparing to start the keto diet with my boyfriend! we are gonna be doing alot of lifestyle changes, so i appreciate the support! makes me so happy "

2650	43428	49	bq7pbb	eo2fm9a	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	you look disgusting. i had lost a bunch of weight from running and was eating well healthier and stopped drinking soda. i always wore baggie clothes and started wearing form fitting clothes. people said i was tiny when this happened and they were surprised. this one girl though at work said it to me at work in front of my peers/coworkers. she looked at me in disgust and just said those words along with some others. no one stood up for me even though i asked the others what their thoughts were they just said they think i run too much. years later i got apologies from the peers/coworkers when they knew they should have said something to support me. the girl that said it which i still work with has never apologized. she doesn't hate me or anything and we used to do stuff outside of work. i don't resent her but it made me realize i deserve better and actively will not spend time around her as much as possible. still though it makes me a little insecure to this day i have to admit.

"my aunt was one of the sweetest and most loving people i had ever met. she had a mental handicap and essentially spent her life with the mindset of a four year old girl. she couldn't do much on her own but loved stuffed animals, walking around target looking for new toys or music, just basically spending time with us. she developed breast cancer which at the time i thought was no big deal. i was certain with today's medicine they would just cut it out, give her some treatment and life would go back to normal. less than a year later she had been admitted to the e.r. several times because she just stopped breathing on her own and was constantly losing consciousness. the cancer had spread to her lungs and brain. about 1/3 of her brain matter on the ct scan was just a blob of cancer at that point. she always said she loved me a lot but the two things that hurt the most were her last words to me: ""big brother, help me. help me. help me."" she had always called me her little brother when i was growing up. but i guess at this point she knew i was the one taking care of her. hearing her call me her big brother and just asking over and over for me to help me was heartbreaking. it still hurts thinking about that."

2672	43428	68	bq7pbb	eo2s9yh	what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	at my last job i had a team of about 20 people under me. i honestly did everything for them. if someone was sick i would cover for them. if someone messer up, nothing would reach the superiors but we would work it out. we worked in social work, with time contracts, so at one point it was clear that all of us (me too!) were leaving. i could argue with my own bosses for as many people to be kept in the company as possible, probably 5 or so of them. for the rest i made sure they had excellent recommendations, hell i even emailed them fitting job offers in the area. i had to leave as well. then i read them bitching about me on facebook. saying hurtful things about me that werent even true. i called them out right then and there. one employee just wrote something like its true, bitch!, nobody else stepped in to say it wasnt. i just blocked them all and threw away the wedding invitations i already had for them. still makes me sad when i think about it.
