3598	39727	8539	bv6o78	epmbtio	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	portion sizes and adverts for drugs would be the big two. all the other differences would be either stuff you don't experience on holiday or within the kind of differences you'd expect from another country. but the meals were just unbelievably massive, and having people hawk serious medication to you through the tv was very jarring. oh, and the number and duration of ad breaks as well. one night me and my dad were in some small town on our way to somewhere else, decided to watch silence of the lambs on tv. the ad breaks towards the end were insane, completely ruined the film. they managed to put one in the middle of the fucking finale. remember the bit where clarice finds the well, and then the lights go out? that's where they put an ad break. fuck me sideways.
3599	39727	15558	bv6o78	eplwd83	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the fact that we have never thought of a concept like sonic (the drive in place) blew my mind
3600	39727	6653	bv6o78	epno0e2	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i saw an advert on tv for some prescription meds then the presenter started listing off all the side effects, including death!
3601	39727	11427	bv6o78	epnmk97	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	honestly.walmart!! went there to buy a sim card and some groceries. also found out that i could also buy pet fish, car parts and shoes.all in one building?! also, while in the queue to the checkout, we were next up and they just decided to close the lane? we had to requeue somewhere else.

3603	39727	20595	bv6o78	epmy97f	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the size of everything. still shocks me that driving from nyc to cleveland, oh takes twice as much time as a trip across my country. airport security is also overwhelming (and extremely boring).
3604	39727	27405	bv6o78	epmufbp	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the ads in between tv shows felt unnecessarily long, and also repeated the same info, just worded differently.
3605	39727	9612	bv6o78	epm6j80	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	you can actually go to the atm without leaving your car. line for the driveby is longer then in the coffee shop it self.

""that other bloke.he touches kids and pisses on toilet seats"" ""this ad is brought to you by the other politician."" blew my mind when i saw those."
3612	39727	5260	bv6o78	epnjpab	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the political ads on tv that do not promote but instead demonize candidates! so and so is a devil from hell that will eat your newborn for breakfast if you vote for them! dont do it if you love america! scary music and black and white footage included. weird, very weird.
3613	39727	4068	bv6o78	epo8cdw	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"was staying with the nicest family ever. they worked extremely long hours and lived in the suburbs. i wanted to cook for them as a surprise and set out to the store on foot, with an empty backpack for the groceries. had to walk along the curb of, and then cross, an 8 lane highway to get to the store. had to stop a really really old man from bagging the groceries. then was stopped by police on the way back. they were very friendly, just wanted to know where my car had broken down. ended up explaining to me that there was basically zero infrastructure for walking out in the burbs. they took me home. on the way, i saw a sign ""gas 99 cents a gallon, bud's xmas gift to the community"", blew my dad's mind when i told him later. got home, thanked the nice officers, made a vegetable casserole. when my wonderful host family came home, they were blown away but also extremely worried. all in all, i would say that no matter how crazy america may be or seem, americans make up for all of it. they are some of the friendliest, most welcoming people i have ever met."
3614	39727	2604	bv6o78	epml5ig	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	years ago, it used be striking how much violence was allowed on tv, while anything even remotely resembling sex was censored. i think the internet, cable tv and syndication of tv shows has blended the cultures in this regard.
3615	39727	12661	bv6o78	epmi2n8	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	la - the amount of homeless people, straight up walking past an elderly woman living on the streets to get to the 7-11.
3616	39727	6436	bv6o78	epn5vby	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i've visited new york city several times in the period 2009 - 2014. &#x200b; positive wtf: giant buildings with sometimes stunning architecture; woolworth building, 40 wall street, chrysler building, etc . already impressive on pics but overwhelming when literally towering above you in real-life. &#x200b; negative wtf: some employees of the tsa. man, i don't expect you to smile and be all sunshine, but screaming with all your might at some passengers while your head turns red with saliva dripping out of your mouth might be a bit much.
3617	39727	24413	bv6o78	epmmv04	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	raccoons stealing our bread over night while camping. the box was closed and we put weights on it, yet these clever little trash pandas found a way in and out.
3618	39727	11483	bv6o78	epnauim	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	answering for someone else. (i'm american answering for a german) ice machines in hotels. they couldnt understand why the hotels had so many ice machines and why there are signs for them. i couldnt stop laughing about it and honestly have no idea why we love ice so much. he also asked what people had in the big plastic cups. i said pop/soda. he laughed and said they look like they are 1.5 liters, there is no way they are drinking soda. silly friend, yes yes they are.
3619	39727	1360	bv6o78	epnmorx	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	actually seeing new york and its skyscrapers. all cities in europe look like hamlets compared to ny. my mind was also blown when i saw morgan freeman chilling in jackson, ms.
3620	39727	14115	bv6o78	epns4af	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	on the first day of our us roadtrip we stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant south of san francisco. when we tried to pay the waiter told us that another customer that just had left paid for our meals and whished us a nice trip. wtf, who does that. so nice! totally made my day and honestly the whole vacation.
3621	39727	1119	bv6o78	epnx8ol	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i saw a woman put sugar in her coke at ihop for breakfast. i've been told that's gross even for other americans.
3622	39727	6608	bv6o78	epmlg51	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	jay walking and the lack of pavement/sidewalk on many roads. i found it so hard to just get from one place to another.
3623	39727	6283	bv6o78	epn4sx6	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	\- the amount of homeless and/or crazy persons who would yell at people. \- portion sizes and free refills. \- listed prizes are without the tax added. \- how car-centric even the cities are. \- how many commercials you have on tv.
3624	39727	35983	bv6o78	epm84a4	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	everyone wanted me to have a great day.

3628	39727	5840	bv6o78	epmr32y	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the infrastructure is much older than what you see on tv
3629	39727	18548	bv6o78	epn66ov	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i gotta say, hearing the extreme stereotypical accents that you only hear on comedy shows e.g. jewish mother, unintelligible southerner etc.
3630	39727	2626	bv6o78	epn27r8	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	movies set in new york prepare you for everything except the smell of shit

3632	39727	822	bv6o78	epnbkix	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	- the choices of cereal at the breakfast in the hotel in miami beach all had at least 20% sugar. - everything about las vegas (but in a good way). - how nyc taxi drivers drive. that was my first trip to the us, and that taxi ride from laguardia to lower manhattan made an impression. luckily nyc is walkable and subwayable.
3633	39727	13424	bv6o78	eplvern	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	portion sizes. the number and length of ads in tv shows, its crazy disruptive.
3634	39727	11395	bv6o78	epm1g5y	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i thought the gap in bathroom stall doors were a myth. didnt get privacy for my five day stay. how do you shit when someone can look you in the eye?!
3635	39727	2073	bv6o78	epnpij6	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	free water in any restaurant. freeee i am from italy and here it costs about 1,5/lt in almost every restaurant.
3636	39727	1163	bv6o78	epnpeu9	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	during my first visit, i was astonished at the number of small airports and incredible number of small aircraft. so much freedom to fly across a vast country. amazing.
3637	39727	1698	bv6o78	epnm5zs	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the portion sizes. a meal in a restaurant at home will usually leave me fairly full, but i had to be rolled out of the place after eating in a us restaurant
3638	39727	1892	bv6o78	epnqqfe	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	especially as a bloody introverted finnish person (stereotypes kicking in) it was terrifying how people had a ton of chitchat and were really talkative. wished me a good day and asked about useless stuff don't talk to me please i am not qualified for this
3639	39727	606	bv6o78	epnsh7k	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	gaps in the bathroom stalls doors. like wtf ?
3640	39727	5293	bv6o78	epm3olj	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i have an uncle that moved away from the us about 30 years ago. whenever he comes back to visit he always is horrified by the commercials on tv for prescription drugs. it never occurred to me as an american how ridiculous a concept it is that the patient should tell his doctor what medicine should be prescribed based off of an advert *by that medicine*.
3641	39727	417	bv6o78	epnhal7	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the speed at which you guys repair roads. i mean wtactualf. my dad and i went to la and the day we arrived they tore open a 2km strip of road. when we went to visit warner studios next day they had started to pave again. when the tour was finished at 4pm and we walked back the road was in full fucking use again. seriously that project would have taken at least half a year usually a year for that much of a project. i am truly amazed.
3642	39727	410	bv6o78	epnw8u4	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"went there as a german soldier on a semi work related trip, wearing uniform. the sheer number and the way people thanked me for my service (apparently as a german i qualify for this by extension), gave me discounts or even stuff for free (starbucks) was astonishing. in germany, the public treats its servicemen with what one federal president called ""a friendly non-interest"". the us showed me a different world. but i also gotta admit that it was frightening to a certain degree. it feels like. a bit too much of everything. too much admiration, too much trust in what the uniform stands for, too much ""automatic repetition"" of the phrases and as a result too little normality. still a memorable and enjoyable one-time experience"
3643	39727	946	bv6o78	epnckg2	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"the first thing my friend from the netherlands said when she got off the plane: ""it's really fucking humid"""

3646	39727	20892	bv6o78	epm4631	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	roadside billboards scattered along the interstates in the south. &#x200b; billboard # 1: jesus billboard # 2: porn and booze, next exit billboard # 3: guns! guns! guns!
3647	39727	7451	bv6o78	eplwmz9	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	\- portion sizes \- extreme airconditioning (like fridge-temperature inside) \- advertisement (seems to be everywhere possible) \- ads on how much you can sue people (honestly, wtf?!) \- extreme patriotism (stars and stripes on every item you can think off) \- homeless people (especially in san francisco)
3648	39727	1604	bv6o78	epmvfxe	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	how dirty and disgusting hollywood is. funnily enough, i've overheard heaps of us tourists feeling the same way. public transport in la is pretty cheap and usable. not very well planned out or connected but uber/lyft makes no sense a lot of the time due to the wtf traffic. almost no under 40 white people unless they looked poorer than average white person. come to think of it. hardly ever saw white people working in regular service/retail jobs. like fast food or ticketing offices. ny skyline is quite something and the amount of skyscrapers is mind boggling. overall the ny and la metro areas are so huge, it's difficult to compare (haven't spent enough time in london nor been to moscow) or experience anything similar in europe.
3649	39727	1795	bv6o78	epmm8xp	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	flags everywhere. not just people's homes but in front of everything, i even saw a us flag in front of a supermarket. wtf. i could never imagine a union jack in front of tesco.
3650	39727	658	bv6o78	epn6fpb	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	seeing an 80 year old woman working behind the register at a supermarket
3651	39727	5024	bv6o78	eplyjbp	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"""i'm irish too"" said in a texan accent after they heard me speak i'm not even irish i'm welsh  e: also the people that welcome you to a store as you go on.it has.sinister undertones"
3652	39727	190	bv6o78	epnwcrw	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	once saw an ad for a wallet that was also a knife.
3653	39727	345	bv6o78	epnphek	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the cheerful, smiling faces on a medication tv add while the voice over mentioned that ***death*** is a possible side effect.
3654	39727	92	bv6o78	epneaux	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"dogs or coyotes howling in the night. when you're watching american stuff and you hear coyotes in the background, it's like ""ok they're just there, whatever"", but when you hear it in real life, it's so unsettling. and also, how far everything is. went to florida, and we had to travel through the ""everglades"", which was just a highway through a swampy area, for an hour or so. imagine getting stuck halfway through it"
3655	39727	467	bv6o78	epo1715	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"the size of your food portions. am actually african. i was amazed!!!! as i took a sip of my extra large milkshake i was singing in my head "" i bless the rains down in africa"""
3656	39727	84	bv6o78	epo4fvm	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the absolutely mind boggling level of advertising you put up with just about everywhere. also the extent to which cars have moulded the country, socially, geographically and psychologically. the place sometimes feels like the web of highways always existed there and civilisation just attempted to adapt to it, living in between the roads. j walking!!?! wtf
3657	39727	172	bv6o78	epnt5fo	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the way complete strangers would just initiate conversation with me inside an elevator. it's so weird but i honestly loved it.
3658	39727	4028	bv6o78	epmm52r	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	* you guys do not seem to have have touch and go card payment systems. a lot of places still rely on signatures. * almost all food tastes sweet, including bread. * credit history anywhere outside of the us isnt considered real and will not hep prove youre a real person when you want to open a bank account. all this from living in nyc a few years back.
3659	39727	528	bv6o78	epnwxb1	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	dutchy here, the usa is my favorite holiday destination, i'd even move there if i could. i've toured the west, california, arizona, nevada. spent a week in las vegas and another week in manhattan. the biggest wtf: you guys are really friendly, this is not the image to us has abroad but i can't remember any notable bad encounters, just one waitress with a shitty attitude insisting on getting a tip anyway which is somewhat understandable. i don't even know why the nyc subway gets a bad rap. second wtf: how huge your roads are, driving in the us boils down to pressing the gas to go, pressing the brake to stop. just point it in the general direction you want to go and you'll be fine, lanes are too wide to hit anything.no engine braking though, drive up to the traffic light, hit the brakes at the last possible moment. i've had multiple people honk at me for letting go of the gas and just letting the car roll when i saw a red light in the distance.
3660	39727	223	bv6o78	epnfl7u	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the sheer number of women that liked my accent. i was just too cowardly to ask any of them out! &#x200b; could have had 3 or 4 good-sized little british/american half-breeds by now.
3661	39727	456	bv6o78	epnggn5	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	why do you advertise food by shouting about what isnt contained?
3662	39727	342	bv6o78	epn7olv	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	it a minor thing, but everyone asking how are you without wanting to know the answer.
3663	39727	10702	bv6o78	epndo6m	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"i ate a blue slurpee ice-drink thing in a theme park and three hours later, i kid you not, i did a vibrantly blue shit. no food in europe has ever contained an ingredient that made my shit come out blue. that made me go go ""wtf"" - i was wtfing so hard that eleven years later i still remember that blue shit. thanks america! fond memories. edit: i have master's degree in philosophy, i've seen and done some epic stuff in my world travels. and my most upvoted comment ever is about a blue shit i once took. fml, this universe is absurd, i'm going to bed now."
3664	39727	212	bv6o78	epnua3m	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the tennis ball sized scoop of ice cream on top of my stack of pancakes that turned out to be butter.
3665	39727	257	bv6o78	epn88bw	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	how casualy crackheads and drunks walk around just like talking to people and everyone just accepts that they are there
3666	39727	2179	bv6o78	epn1in1	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	not from europe but came to the us a couple of years ago what i found weird was, people consuming coffee like water
3667	39727	409	bv6o78	epmlyhy	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	went to mc donalds and ordered what i always order. but it tasted completely different. and fanta was just weird orange juice syrup.
3668	39727	197	bv6o78	epo039d	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	australian here. i did a lot of hiking in america around cali and the south west. my first comment is how amazing your national parks are, backed up by an organised park service. i havent seen camp sites in australia half as organised as yours. second was how cheap food is! as i was road tripping i originally planned to cook for myself out the back of my van. but honestly it was cheaper to eat at dennys, where i only had to hit breakfast and dinner and i was set for the day - the portion sizes were huge. third. wtf is with your toilets! they are filled to the brim with water, and your poo just sorta floats around until you flush where it then goes around in circles until it goes down the drain. my first few craps in your great nation was really unsettling. but i got used to it by the end. fourth. the disparity between rich and poor. like you see it in australia a between suburbs bit - but it was just so pronounced in america.
3669	39727	863	bv6o78	epmuytx	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	tipping being obligatory, whether it was good service or not.
3670	39727	1666	bv6o78	epn46di	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"when in boston someone realised we were british and came over to have a conversation: ""oh my god, i have a friend in england. she lives in london. do you know her?"" &#x200b; hmm, there are 9 million people who live in london, and 65 million in the uk. the chance of me knowing one individual is quite remote!"
3671	39727	4066	bv6o78	epm8zkz	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"was on an exchange. 2 most memorable questions were ""can you see the moon in europe"" and ""do you have pizza in europe"". something else i'll never forget was the map of europe in the school i went to which still showed the country of yugoslavia (which doesnt exist anymore) and all the borders were fucked up. a map in the school."
3672	39727	62	bv6o78	epn5r0e	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	indoors feels colder than being naked in the winter
3673	39727	6211	bv6o78	epn0i0r	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	how low down the toilets are compared to here in the uk. went to sit on one, dropped as i thought i'd missed the darned thing then felt like i'd broken my ass on impact. it's like missing the bottom step of the stairs, but even worse. &#x200b; edit: holy moly my inbox. thank you for the silver kind anon! first silver and it's all about breaking my ass. :d
3674	39727	662	bv6o78	epno4pj	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	probably going to end up in the burieds, but two things stood out to me: 1. the number of people with expensive clothes and/or vehicles that lived in homes that didn't match their 'upscale' presentation. 2. the vastly different quality and taste of fast food meats in the states versus those in europe.
3675	39727	398	bv6o78	epn9swx	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	tipping. what? you're going to log my card details and then when i leave i'm supposed to trust that you'll charge the amount i wrote down on a piece of paper? and i'm supposed to be fine with that?
3676	39727	54	bv6o78	epnvesw	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	this will get lost in the thread by now, but the heart attack grill in las vegas absolutely blew my mind. the fact that outside it they have what looks like a scale for use on a farm, but for weighing people, and if they weigh over 350lbs they eat for free, was horrendous and it took me ages to get my english mind around it.
3677	39727	58	bv6o78	epnywas	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the stunning geography
3678	39727	3317	bv6o78	epmp09o	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the amount of obese people. obese people riding electric scooters at shopping places. being handicapped because you are obese.
3679	39727	837	bv6o78	epmq331	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	ads for prescription meds. like what the actual fuck.
3680	39727	312	bv6o78	epndlue	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	armed officer at movie theater. i need prescription from a doctor to buy contact lenses???
3681	39727	295	bv6o78	epnb06c	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	how few and short vacations american's get
3682	39727	723	bv6o78	epmtv8o	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	at the petro station, sorry gas station; you can purchase ammo, gas, milk, rifle, beer, fireworks and other 'daily' use objects. this was in montana, 2005.
3683	39727	1589	bv6o78	epn0oqj	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"went to l.a. a week last year for work. things like portion sizes, the average weight of people, quality of food and commercials etc. are just what i thought they would be. but the surprises for me: 1) i do know the modeled los santos in gta from l.a. but i didn't realise how well they did it. people talk and behave basically the same way. the sound, the light, the landscape, the frickin radio! i thought a big part of it was just exaggeration. nope! this was actually kind of fun, driving around looking at things going ""oh wow this is where that thing happened in the game"". awesome! 2) there are a lot of homeless people and you can tell a lot of them are sick and/or have psychological problems. this sure doesn't remove any of my prejudice about american healthcare and social security. 3) the extreme differences between neighbourhoods that are right next to each other. sure, i understand why one street might have houses that look nice and are well taken care of and another not so much. but why is there a difference in how well paved the road is? why is the ""poor"" street in such decay with lots of potholes and the ""rich"" street so clean and free from pot holes? aren't things like fixing the roads the responsibility of the city? mind boggling that they care more about rich neighbourhoods and the poor ones. if they did that so blatantly back here there'd be some shit and a big fan involved. generally the social class differences are of a magnitude i've never seen before. honestly i thought the things i heard before where somewhat exaggerated. i was wrong. and it is right in front of you basically all of the time! really really sad to see."
3684	39727	44	bv6o78	epnncez	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	that there's a whole channel about the weather, it runs 24 hours a day and makes everything seem hyper-dramatic, and it's grimly watchable, mainly because broadcast tv is so crap. also a wtf is the sheer number of adverts that us viewers put up with on broadcast tv. the most popular tv channel here in the uk has no adverts, and even the main commercial channels have few adverts compared to most us tv.
3685	39727	1412	bv6o78	epmky3k	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	their size. i'm american, but was in europe for a few years on a work assignment and didn't come home in between. when i came back home, i was dumbstruck by how many morbidly obese americans you see when you, for example, walk around a mall.
3686	39727	93	bv6o78	epnn5fm	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the fact that many tried to get me to find jesus
3687	39727	414	bv6o78	epn66bi	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	nobody owns a kettle
3688	39727	954	bv6o78	epmm0en	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"i own a restaurant and could never be in that business if i had to do it the way americans do. ""the customer is always right"" in my country means that even though a request seems unreasonable or means extra effort for you, you do your best to make it happen because you want the guest to be happy and have a memorable experience. if they complain about something you, within reason, try your best to make it right and don't argue or get offended. however, it seemed to me that in the us that means ""the customer can treat the hard working staff like shit and gets rewarded for it"". also the compensation is absolutely ridiculous. you bought something and accidentally broke it the minute you got home? here, have your money back and a brand new item. you didn't like the food even though you ate all of it? no check for you sir, have some free desert as well. in my country ""not liking something"" is a you problem. better luck next time. you don't get to pick something else just because you picked wrong (of course i do sometimes make an exception). and if you treat my staff like crap, you're out of my business fast. i was shocked by the amount of people i witnessed being rude or short with wait staff or casiers. who are, btw, super friendly, cheerful and welcoming 99,9% of the time. the hospitality is awesome, way better than in most places in europe i think, but this made me go wtf. in addition to that: the tipping system as part of the wages of the employees appalls me and the taxes not being added in the price that is shown is just inconvenient."
3689	39727	306	bv6o78	epng2ae	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	the size of people's arses. seriously. you'd be talking to an objectively attractive girl behind the counter, she'll walk round in front and boom! she's got a shelf capable of holding the complete works of shakespeare, and that's out to the side! fat in america seems to forget the face and shoulders and just accumulates in troubling proportions around the waist.
3690	39727	118	bv6o78	epnt31w	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	something that ithought myight be relevant to this thread is that i had the opposite experience. the first time i went to europe i was expecting it to be all cafe's and bistros. imagine my suprise when kitty corner to the eiffel tower is a kfc accross the street from buckingham palace is a burger king and right next to notre dame is a mcdonalds. the amount of american fast food chain restaurants around some of the most iconic eureopean landmarks and in europe in general blew my mind and forever changed my romanticized version of europe.
3691	39727	45	bv6o78	epnt98k	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	how everyone is so friendly and just talks to you. if you did that in the uk you'd get weird looks
3692	39727	40	bv6o78	epnv9bu	europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	i'm canadian. after all the rumors i'd heard growing up, i'm continually surprised by how nice everyone is in the us. it's really easy to make friends there. every country has jerks, but i didn't see very many on my travels.
