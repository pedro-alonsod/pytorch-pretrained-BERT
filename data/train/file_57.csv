1295	50240	16579	blrjnj	emrh7fb	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	somebody needs to make a book called the time traveler's guide. each chapter is a premise of you being stranded back in time in a different era. it would have information you need to change the world with available technology at the time. like say how to make gunpowder and a cannon if it was 1300's europe. maybe there's a book like that out there already, and if so, it's amazon time. and then in the case of this thread, have the digital copy before you get sent back and go to the 1800's chapter and write down what you can before the battery dies.

1299	50240	4257	blrjnj	emqrdr7	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	go all back to the future: part 2 and mail it to myself on a certain date in the future so that i can try and reverse engineer the phone and become the pioneer of smart phones, become a multi-billionaire and rule the phone world if not the entire world. it makes sense, right? edit: come to think of it, this sounds more like paycheck with fewer stunts and traveling back in time instead of forward.
1300	50240	5044	blrjnj	emrexhz	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	do i have a chance to prepare? if so, grab an offline copy of wikipedia with science and engineering topics. pretty much every phone designed can accept ~5v dc power from the usb port for slow charging. if it were 200 years in the past, we would have voltaic piles available in research labs, but no dynamo. since each copper/zinc cell has about .5 volts, stack a series of 10 of them together, with piles in parallel supplying power to the phone. now i can use the phone without having to worry about running out of power! it might be necessary to take the phone apart to connect the external power source to the phone, since i might not have a usb-c cable to cannibalize. at this point, exploit the futures knowledge of geography to buy valuable land for mining, and introduce electricity for industrial purposes about 50 years early.
1301	50240	10474	blrjnj	emr6uxf	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	i'd show people pictures of my dog.
1302	50240	37136	blrjnj	emquybl	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	don't use it. find rich person. demo its uses and leave out the battery stuff. sell it to rich person for a ridiculous amount of currency. get as far away as possible.
1303	50240	11943	blrjnj	emqvqmu	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	i'd take photos until my battery would run out. then i'd leave the phone in some safe place waiting for time to catch up so someone can find it, charge it and find the photos.
1304	50240	31657	blrjnj	emqspud	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	die of polio
1305	50240	1449	blrjnj	emqujau	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	i'd like to think i would do something super clever and make myself rich, but i know myself better. i'd just play candy crush until it dies.
1306	50240	7649	blrjnj	emr2whq	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	die of like a million different viruses and illnesses that i am not immune to. also spread around modern superbugs that will eradicate all human life on earth. &#x200b; also take a selfie before i die
1307	50240	6509	blrjnj	emquh91	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	whoever has hardcore history downloaded on their phone is about to be a prophet edit: to those of you complaint butterfly effect and shit. i just mean publish an article in a local paper about your predictions a month before it happens. it wouldnt cause a ripple at all, and would most likely be looked upon afterwards. kind of like nostradamus.
1308	50240	1274	blrjnj	emqusuc	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	find a merchant, preferably one in a royal court, demonstrate the camera/recording abilities and talk up the potential of how you can use it to record and organize your royal life. downplay/lie when they ask how long it'll last. get paid as much as possible and then haul ass out of that country and preferably across an ocean as quick as possible.
1309	50240	5935	blrjnj	emqr805	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	maybe i'd start some sort of religion/cult around this tiny, cold box that makes sounds and has moving pictures, get rich and enjoy the rest of my life. granted that i'm not going to get executed for witchcraft. depends on the delivery i guess. edit: apparently i'm stupid and can't do math, so thanks guys for reminding me that going 200 years back would get you to 1819, where you probably wouldn't get executed for witchcraft. but still, the thought of starting a cult is very amusing to me! also, someone mentioned the battery running out, maybe you could demonstrate it a few times and build a myth around you that way? edit 2: i've created mormonism. i had no idea. thanks for making me aware of that!
1310	50240	17564	blrjnj	emqr88a	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	without much technical knowledge, not a whole lot. it isn't like the internet was in existence 200 years ago. so unless you had a lot of info saved locally, it isn't very useful. maybe use it for a flashlight for a while?
1311	50240	11503	blrjnj	emqr1iy	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	turn the phone off and leave it in an attic, live the rest of my days as any other person, on my death bed, tell my grandchild about the phone and to go look for it. they find it but the battery is probably dead by now and i dont where im going with this
1312	50240	575	blrjnj	emqtxzp	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	show up to a world fair with my mysterious light box. make a name for myself as an inventor or at least some mysterious guy with a mystical device. invent basic electricity generators and computers. try to charge the phone with a hand generator or something. try to reverse engineer the phone.
1313	50240	588	blrjnj	emqy5gj	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	honestly intevent antibiotics and cancel my spotify subscription. those bastard ain't getting me shekels anymore.

1318	50240	9106	blrjnj	emqxmjj	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	that would be 1819. lady ada lovelace (the inventor of the first working mechanical computer) started working on it in the 1830's. i would find her and charles babbage and explain all the advances in computers and softward and hardware (i.e transistor design) in general. i am an electrical engineer with 25 years experience in digital vlsi design and audio signal processing. after teaching them knowledge that wouldn't be known for 150 to 200 years, i would leave with them the working example of a computer more powerful than they could dream of, the smart phone. i would tell them to keep it safe, until technology develops that they can effectively reverse engineer it (though i already would have given them a high level overview of how it works , from the rf front end to the back end application processor). i would also give them a high level overview of the manufacturing process for such a device. i could teach them how to make a dc power supply to keep the iphone charged but i don't have the specs on the recharge connector protocol, so it is not as simple as making a dc power supply and then your done. my hope is that i advance technology by a hundred years. however the best that can hope for is a few decades because advancement in one technology requires advancement in other technologies, some of which i have no expertise in. this is like how the ancient greeks discovered the basic steam engine, but this didn't cause the industrial revolution to happen a 2000 years earlier because the metallurgy required to make vessels that could withstand the high pressures of a working practical steam engine would not be invented for hundreds of years. also if ada lovelace was hot, i would try to fuck her. edit: 1) my wanting to fuck her doesn't negate the truth of all the technical stuff said before. 2) to those saying she's 4 years old, i implied that while i would arrive in the world when she was 4, i wouldn't meet her until she started working on the computer, which would put her at ~20 yrs of age. 3) though i'm married , 1833 < 1999. so according to temporal boner logic, its not cheating. edit2: 4) yes some of you are right: she didn't technically invent the computer; her collaborator charles babbage did that. she programmed the machine though. so hardware: babbage , software: lovelace. 5) some of you state that i the charging protocol is not complicated and that my dc power supply would work. but i think others correctly point out that only applies to the old usb connectors. this won't work with the lightning connector on a modern iphone.
1319	50240	411	blrjnj	emriznw	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	open tinder. oh look, it works exactly the same 200 years from now.
1320	50240	191	blrjnj	emr3zta	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	"suddenly i just want to keep a pocket solar charger on me at all times. that being said, start ""writing"" most of the stuff on my kindle."

1326	50240	159	blrjnj	emr3un5	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	"assuming i was aware that this was going to happen and could prepare for it, i'd have downloaded as much from wikipedia as possible. from there you'd be in a great position. if it was like, i just charged my phone and then walk out of my door and ""poof"" i've unexpectedly traveled then i guess i can use it to let them hear what kind of music we have in the future, show them some photos of my dog, and use it as a flashlight - but that's about it i think. guess i better download some stuff from wikipedia, just in case."

1331	50240	233	blrjnj	emrnar9	you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	"i arrive 200 hundred years in the past, if we go from direct location i am in the upper west side of manhattan in 1819. my office space is now a farm of a rich resident within the city. after talking to them for awhile, i will set out to find robert fulton. i am about to invest or work on his uss ontario, the first steamboat to travel between ny and ohio. i invest in that shit, rail roads, and mills (where they make cloths) and become a robber baron during the dawn of the industrial revolution (i give people reasonable time off, and breaks each day, so everybody loves me) . with my new cash, and the ability to predict the future, i use my money to go on a few year long vacation. i immediately head to illinois why may you ask. to kill indians, nope. i need to find a young abraham lincoln, who at this point is like 20 and just started becoming a local lawyer. i talk to him for hours pretending to be a client needing representation. we become friends, and then i head down to maryland. i begin to purchase large amounts of slaves, with the plan to move them out west and free them starting a black commune (possibly in california where we find gold, and an easy access to income in the sacramento valley about 2 decades before the gold rush) where they are able to have a job, receive education (most slaves couldnt read) and live in the relative freedom. i try to buy as many slaves as possible however, i am looking for a specific young african american. a polymath and possibly the smartest guy in american history not named benjamin franklin, fredrick douglas. i find him, he's about 10, i free him, and send him to oxford to school those assholes. then after all this, i start investing in oil, i hire a young rockefeller to run the books, then i get jp morgan to help manage my railroad empire. and last but not least, at 50 as the civil war begins to dawn, i tell my proteges abraham lincoln and fredrick douglas to handle the situation (i also tell abe to watch out for fords theater) and then i head off to the ottoman empire. the empire is failing and i am willing to make a huge investment if they give me saudi arabia. they are desperate and oil hasnt been discovered there yet so i get what i wish. i also ask them to create a country for the armenian people, they do. after that i create a democracy in the model of the us in saudi arabia. i reach out to the us, and we become allies, normalizing american and the muslim worlds around a hundred years before we actually do. then i head to the congo fuck the belgians, i am taking this bitch over. no hands or dicks will be cut off in the name of rubber. i still make a killing on rubber. bang im back in the us the civil war is over and abe is dead (he didnt watch out for fords theater). with a large black coalition i am elected to congress where i continue reconstruction for forty years after it ended in this reality. race relations are good in the us. after an incredibly successful and long congressional run where i speed up the suffrage movement (and tell the daughters of the confederacy to fuck themselves) . as a 90 year old man, i invest in electric cars (thomas edison, tesla, the lumiere brothers, the wright brothers, and percy lavon julian have worked for me there entire lives) as my final frontier. we reverse advertise electric cars, making oil cars seem girly and that antisemitic asshole henry ford never makes a dime because i developed the assembly line forty years before he was born. with billions of dollars i die happily surrounded by my family. i give everything to the commune, the congo, and saudi arabia and leave a small portion for my family and close friends. in a portion of my will there is very specific instructions. as the new (20th) century dawns a trusted family member opens a safe. in the safe there are instructions to operate a strange square device. it hasnt been turned on since i arrived to this time. my son turns the phone on, the instructions read ""the following underlined material is an address in austria, at this address lives a happy family. that family has a son, he is a baby and very cute. kill that fucking baby."" that baby is named adolf hitler. i win the game"
