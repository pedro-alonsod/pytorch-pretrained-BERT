"i actually had a bit of a moment but i don't know if it counts. my father is an avid user of the n-word and in general, has some quite racist opinions, which i inherited. in fourth grade, i switched schools from a school with mostly white kids to one with people from everywhere. that's where i found some new friends with a big mixture of ethnicities. one day i go to a friends house and he has some friends there and we play video games. at one point i look up and realized i'm the only white person in this room. before i always thought of poc as different, there i realized that i was the different one. ergo: if we all can be ""the different one"" we are all the same."

7882	18740	6928	bnqk9j	en91jiw	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i come from a family of racists. they spoke of other (than whites) races using ethnic slurs as common as commenting on the weather. when i was about 5, my older brother and i went into the local bakery to pick up an order for our mom who was waiting in the car. a black boy was in front of us in line. this was something i hadn't often seen and i said very loudly to my brother, look it's a n-r! my brother quickly shushed me,which made me very confused, but it was the crushed look on the boy's face that made me start to question my family's viewpoint. over 40 years later, i have a very diverse friend group, but still feel shame on how i made that boy feel those many years ago.

7884	18740	19335	bnqk9j	en8itpc	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	grew up in a town with no black people. dad was very racist. so naturally i grew up racist. joined the military and was forced to hang out with a melting pot of races. straightened me out.
7885	18740	4680	bnqk9j	en97f40	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i made a throwaway for this one. a lot of people are saying they weren't really racist, but i was. i absolutely was. i grew up in an affluent area of orange county ca. my family had money, but not nearly enough as many of the kids at my school. i was an only child, got picked on, had pretty low self-esteem. my family were basically country club racists. basically they didn't actively drop n bombs all over the place, but they had prejudices and didn't push back at all when i started saying racist things as a kid. i absolutely said the n word with my friends, laughed about it, but was always too scared to do so publically. when i got to high school, i was big into right wing politics, wanting to join the army, and learning german. i wouldn't say i was a neo-nazi, my best friend's brother was a neo-nazi and i didn't hang out with any of his friends or want to go into that scene, but i often thought that i would have made a good nazi had i been a german during the third reich. i definitely had friends in high school, but i wanted to go to college in a place that was more conservative and less diverse than i currently was. i figured my life would improve if i went to a place like that. so what changed? i did move to a small midwest town and started taking german in college for real, i took history courses that kind of started to chip away at my view of the world. studying abroad in germany though my junior year is what really started to break the glass on my views. i thought that my german background and last name would win me some favors over there, but people didn't really give a shit at all. i saw that modern germany was categorically and vastly different than the one i crafted in my head. i made friends from all over europe and the world. i had some people i cared about really roast me for some nationalist and militaristic views i had, it made me really mad at the time but eventually, i took their criticism seriously. i came back and finished doing some work in history classes and wrote a paper on nazi propaganda. it was then that i really examined nazi viewpoints through recent experience sand saw how fucking dumb they were. i remember seeing a poster and the text said that the jews were both behind communism and capitalism and just thought, this is just complete fucking nonsense and the people who believe this are morons. i actually did go into the military, i did rotc in college and my time in rotc and active duty pretty much flushed the rest out of me. getting to know, working with, and leading people from different backgrounds and getting to see things through their eyes was an invaluable experience. so to summarize, meeting people from different backgrounds is probably the most important for me and really actually having meaningful conversations, and not walking way when you're challenged. the thing is, i didn't just say 'you're right, nationalism and being racist is wrong i get it now' when i was in germany. i fought back, i defended myself, i thought these people were just butthurt leftists and weren't going to take anything i said seriously anyway. but those conversations planted the seeds that grew over several months, and eventually, they made me recognize how wrong i was. second was i always knew it was wrong to hate people, but i still did. i didn't have an online support structure to keep me in the mindframe. had these online communities existed 10 years ago, i don't know if i could have broken out of this. edit: let me just add because people are seeing this. you often hear that hate is a poison. a huge part of being such a racist is being angry that so much of the world that doesn't conform to your narrow views of what a society should look like. you waste so much energy being so angry all the time. everytime you see a group of people in a place where you don't think they should be, or a couple of different ethnicities, or hearing different languages where you don't think you should be hearing them, you just react to this with anger it's just so fucking poisonous. once i started to let go of this a little bit, i tried to think about these feelings and wondered why i felt them. why were all of these people making me so angry? and why did i think it would be so much better if i was somewhere else? the answer, of course, were problems in my own life, my own feelings of inadequacy, my feelings i squandered a privileged background and couldn't meet my parents' expectations. once i started making those connections and take steps to improve the things in my own life i could control, i felt a lot better about myself and felt that i had a lot more to value in myself than being just a white guy from newport. hate really is poisonous. it poisons your self-image, your impression of others, your sense of empathy, your ability to humanize problems, your ability to connect with friends and family. but it doesn't have to be a death sentence, you can break out of the negatively reinforcing thought process. start by reading stories of people who are totally different from you, watch movies made by people like this, just try and kickstart the apparatus in all of us to give a shit about people. i've had the opportunity to travel to so many places since my first time in germany and the thing i've learned above all else is people by and large want the same things, to live somewhere cool, the hang out with their friends, provide for their families, etc. i'm sorry that it took me a while to learn this, but i do hope someone can see this and start have a gutcheck moment with themselves to think differently about how you think of others. edit2: go figure, i have a reddit account for 5 years and my first gold is on a throwaway where i confess to having been a bad human being. thanks for the gesture, but please, give it to someone more deserving
7886	18740	14919	bnqk9j	en8tvfx	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	my father was a racist just like his father before him. my dad did his best to indoctrinate me and my brother with his racist ways of thinking. i believed my dads philosophy was truth until i entered first grade. that year i was sat next to the only black girl in my class. naturally, i hated her immediately. not only was she a n****r, but an uppity one at that. she was more outspoken than most kids i knew, which i considered to be rude, and her style of diction was different from what i was used to, which made it difficult for me to understand her at first. however as i was forced to interact with her throughout the year, i learned that she was everything my preconceived notions said she shouldnt have been. she was sweet, kind, funny, and intelligent. she helped me grasp the concept of arithmetic and was easily the best speller in our class. the idea that a black person could have all of those positive attributes, especially intelligence that surpassed that of a white person flew in the face of what i had been taught all my life up to that point. knowing that girl was the single experience that made me first question, doubt, and eventually reject my dads beliefs about race. that girl and i remained friends until she transferred schools after our third grade year. i didnt keep in touch with her and have no idea where she is now. if youre out there adia, thank you for just being yourself. you are the very reason why i went down a better path than the one i was shown. i sincerely hope that you are well.

"not really racist but we joked around a lot with racial slurs a lot when i was young. i grew up in a small idaho mormon town and in sunday school we were told not to date outside our race and economic levels. being the only poor brown person in the room it made me feel pretty bad surrounded by a bunch of white girls but that awful feeling made me not want to make someone else feel like that. i cleaned up my language and dropped all the racial slurs and also dropped out of the church ever since. also being called ""ok for a mexican"" dozens of times in my youth only made me want to get away from those things even more."

7889	18740	9313	bnqk9j	en8idy3	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"i wouldnt say i was racist, but more uneducated. i grew up in a predominantly white town so when i was 10 and i moved to a city that was more diverse, it was weird for me. all i had to go off of was how other ethnicities were portrayed in pop culture. well that and my racist aunt and some other closed minded family members. so it was weird for me at first but then i realized we werent as different at all, all was alright. plus it helped that my older brother talked to me about it before we moved. we were driving in our dads black ford truck and we saw another truck very similar to his, just a different color, that was broken down on the side of the highway. he asked what i thought was wrong with it. i said probably the engine or something like that broke (remember, i was 10). he asked if i thought it was because that truck was a different color that it wasnt working and ours was. i said no, that made no sense. he said ""and thats why racism makes no sense."" oddly still remember that but i barely remember us moving. weird."
7890	18740	230	bnqk9j	en9ass0	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i got in trouble for calling a kid in primary school brown and then the head teacher was like i dont know why you would discriminate against him because youre brown too. i looked down at my hands and thought fuck i thought i was white this whole time. that was also the day i found out i was adopted too! i dont know why a 7 year old just realised he was brown and had white parents. i thought about that day for 11 years since.
7891	18740	1145	bnqk9j	en8gp1w	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up mormon in a very small town. this combination provided for a rather. unbecoming upbringing. however, once moving to a larger city, and then moving again to be near denver, i realized that race didn't really matter and i only thought it did because i grew up in a small town of white people. unfortunately my family was too old and set in their ways, but my siblings and i avoided the permanent racism.

"been waiting for this question! so i was born in alabama, still here, and come from a deeply ""white christian"" family. when i was younger i was told to stay away from blacks, mexicans, jews, and muslims. funny enough, not only did i grow up learning to call blacks the ""n"" word, but mexicans, jews, and muslims were followed by the ""n"" word. (yep, literally, mexican ""n"" word is what my dad taught us to call them) well anyways, my deep hate for non-whites/non-christians was deeply rooted thanks to my parents. until in 2011, a tornado outbreak swept through the south. i did a lot of voluntary work, met some black people, but was still worried about being around them. until about a week or two later when our school reopened. we had a lot of new kids from various areas that were damaged. most of them black. so the next school year i get partnered up with this black girl in our history class, and i'm mostly focused on our project, but we ended up talking for a while. she ended up being my first girlfriend a few weeks later, and after i met her family and learned what they went through because of the 2011 outbreak, plus her parents were from birmingham during the civil rights movements, i started to learn that love is more powerful than hate. that ability to make someone smile, there's nothing better than that. while me and her broke up later on, she had a massive impact on my life. i still live in alabama, and i still hear racist remarks from my parents, and from strangers. they will pass away, and sure they may have already left behind their mark of hatred. but hate can be erased with love."

7900	18740	64	bnqk9j	en9876r	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i used to be a neo nazi, i fear for my life from the group i left . the criminal elements are hypocrites as they are against drug use but were manufacturing heroin and i was addicted to that. i had to join the army to get clean and far away. its like any other group , they used race as a uniting factor and brainwashed propaganda as a factor. the drugs kept me chained, and the racism was seen as a loyalty , that whole blood and honor garbage. what changed my heart can be had as a religious moment of clarity and the love i had for my little cousin of mixed race. i didnt want to be part of that and i realize gangs of whites or blacks all operate on a similar bs principle. for anyone reading this , you can get out , and you can get away, message me if you need support ! free yourself from these degenerates!
7901	18740	66	bnqk9j	en9l0c0	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"it was about 3-4 years ago, i was a massive racist fuck. i grew up in a white only town, all my relatives far right. so normally i was exposed to beliveing that the whites are superior. when i was 13 my uncle signed me up for some kkk recruitment or some shitterly like that, i never went because i was ill, but it still stuck to me. and when i was 15-ish i was fully racist. refering to blacks as n***** or animals. my friends and i once acctually beat up a mexican kid (something i can never forgive myself) anyways one day i was driving with my older brother in our pickup truck, when all of the sudden he lost control of the wheel and we crashed off-road. the truck rolled about 4 times before landing on the roof. my brother was severely injured, while i broke a few ribs and my left leg. blood splattered all over the truck i was about to faint. when i saw a car pull up next to us. out of the car exited a black woman in her 40s, she rushed to our truck and pulled me out, she couldnt get my brother out. i fainted. i woke up in the hospital about a day later. with my family surrounding me, next to me was my bro, he looked like a mummy. after a couple hours my family left. my brother and i were left alone. i was hungry so i clicked the ""call nurse"" button. and the nurse that came was black. i was not in a position to be racist so i started talking to her like a normal person. (for the first time i was talking to a person of color like a person) after some time i became friends with the nurse, calling her sometimes just to talk with her. my brother couldnt speak, but i could see that he was a bit pissed. then one day my family came to visit again. i was very thirsty so i called for the nurse again. she arrived and my dad's eyes went up in flames, yelling how a ""animal"" could work in a hospital and treat his son. he consulted the doctor and she was forbidden from coming to our room. i was let go after 2 months, i never saw the nurse after the incident. but i realised what i was dealing with, my family is a bunch of racist assholes. when i came back to school, i instantly tried making friends with the black kids, but the damage has been done. due to my previous behavior they wouldnt hang out with me, and my old friends abandoned me because i was trying to make friends with black kids. we moved to the large city 7 moths later. there i instantly made friends with the kids of color. which was a shock to both other kids and teachers. that day when i came home i was yelled at and grounded ""forbidden"" from hanging out with them. i continued to be friends with them. my parents are still a bit pissed about everything, but soon im going to uni so i can hang out with anyone, no matter thier race, religion and other bullshittery."

"moved away from home. got into the punk/skin scene here and just wanted to fit in. it took me *years* to realize the guys i looked up to were listening to tons of music from people they claimed to hate and that they too just wanted to be a part of something. a short time after that i realized that for myself, it wasn't something i actually wanted to be a part *of*. i was hating something because i was either afraid of it or didn't understand it and that made me feel weak. also, at the time, the last thing i wanted to be was weak. not very long after i kindof cut ties i realized as well that the guys i thought were tough were actually kindof pussies. they would talk a big game behind closed door or in a crowd of like minded people but if they were alone on the street it was *completely* different. they wouldn't stand up for their ""beliefs"" and i knew why. because they knew those beliefs were wrong(and fucked up to be honest). still took me another period of time to realize we are all humans going through our own shit and life is too short to hate for zero reason."
7904	18740	216	bnqk9j	en8ts8n	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	my father used to be quite racist. i don't blame him though. that's a behavior that was beaten into him by my grandfather. i once heard a story from one of my family members about how my grandfather beat him so badly he couldn't go to school for a week just because he caught him walking home from school with a chinese boy. this was just burned into him from a really young age and it stuck for years, but ultimately what changed him was life experiences. he slowly got over it by being forced to work closely with many people of many races. eventually he was able to see that in the end we're all human and no man is greater or less than another because of their origins or skin color. this coupled with counseling for his childhood traumas and that fact that my sister was with an african immigrant for 10 years and has now been with an afghan for over a decade. he realized with all this that nothing was worth losing his daughter. for an oldschool hardass like my dad, admitting that flaw and actively searching for help to better himself is a huge deal and i have huge respect for him. not often a racist piece of shit concedes the argument and admits they're wrong.

"former ""i'm not racist!"" white woman here. reading a book called the hidden brain by shankar vedantam changed my mind. it's about unconscious bias. it helped me understand that humans are drawn to people who look and act like them, and tend to distrust people who look different. this is an ancient impulse designed to protect tribes of humans from being attacked by outsiders, which may have helped in our hunter-gatherer days, but has no place in a global society. i took the [implicit association test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) discussed in the book, which showed that (surprise surprise) i had some implicit bias. so, from then on, i made it a point to ask myself: ""am i worried about that person because they're actually acting sketchy, or because their skin is a different color than mine?"" now, i'm less ""i'm not racist"" and more *""i don't want to be racist.""* i know that i've been living in a racist society. i know that marrying a black man doesn't give me a free pass or absolve me of racism. i know that my brain, like all human brains, can be full of shit sometimes and it's up to me to challenge my first impressions of people. **edit:** platinum?! thanks! i truly appreciate it."

"new account because people know my other one and i don't like to disclose this about myself. in 2005, my senior year of highschool, my father who was very distant throughout my childhood because he had active warrants on him in my home state was murdered by two black youth. he was attempting to buy drugs to sell in order to come visit me for my birthday. it went south and the younger of the pair shot him and threw him in a ditch on the highway. he walked then crawled for about a mile before bleeding to death. i got to witness the trial, when asked why he told his younger brother to kill my father. he said ""you can't trust a fucking white man"". their family testified with similar beliefs and that led me to view that every one of them hated me because of my skin. growing up in the south, i was already kind of prejudiced and that amplified it. i hated blacks with a passion. in my school, there were four and the rest were white. i was one of the most active bullies. when i opened my business, i put a sign that said ""proud to be white"" in opposition to a neighborly black business. the owner came to talk to me and i refused to speak with him. when he left, i flew the confederate flag as well. when the kkk came to march in my hometown, many businesses refused to give them hotel rooms or shelter them, i let them camp out in my yard free of charge as long as they picked up after themselves. when our local court voted to remove the confederate flag from the lobby. i helped share a petition to remove the ""black lives matter"" flag from it as well. and i offered a free drink with a meal to celebrate when it was. a few years ago, i was in an atv accident that really damaged my brain(wear a fucking helmet guys). my insurance didn't cover a lot of things. for a while i walked with a crutch. business started to dwindle and things were looking quite grim. i made the decision to shoot myself several times but never could go through with it. when one day i called to try to negotiate my medical bills, the hospital and debt collectors informed me that it was paid for. about a week went by and the store owner's brother came to visit. he told me that he had learned about my father and he was sorry. despite how miserable i had made his brother, he paid for my bills. and he was honest with me when he told me that he did it because it was the right thing to do but that he hated me with a passion. i broke down and opened up to him and we were able to understand each other. i'll never forget what he said when i told him what the people who killed my father said, "" they sound just as stupid and racist as you are"". and it took that to make me realize that all of my actions made me the same person to them that those two teens were to me that was three years ago and i've learned a lot. it's taken a lot of opening up and understanding. i made amends with the shop owner as well and apologize to everyone i've terrorized in high school in college. it's really took a lot of humbling and i can see why a lot of people would rather double down. i've lost a lot of friends and many other things because of who i am now. but i'm glad everything happened to me to change who i was."

"edit: thank you for silver, friend. i was never one who would say the n word or thought people of other races were beneath me or anything, but i did not understand systemic racism, or the impact that racist policies throughout history still have on people today. in other words, i was that, ""slavery is over. here's an mlk quote, but affirmative action is bullshit. i have a black friend."" white person. \* cringe \* so anyway, what changed all that was first of all, joining the army and actually living among people of every race, religion, background, and persuasion, in reasonably close quarters, for a few years of my life. when you actually get to know people well enough that a few of them will tell you how things really have been for them, it's really eye-opening. that was what showed me that no, things actually aren't equal now, even though the laws would make it seem as if they were. we're still experiencing the world in very different ways. after i got out of the army, and went to a state university for an engineering degree. two really important things happened there. first, my history professor, when i was a freshman, was a black woman who told the side of the story that you don't hear about much in most history classes. sometimes i was skeptical of what she was saying, but i'd always google it, and it turned out she was right. this opened my eyes to the fact that there's this whole story of our country that most of us never even hear, and that there are real and ongoing reasons for policies like affirmative action, and that concepts like reparations actually aren't crazy when you consider the ongoing economic impact of policies like jim crow laws. the other thing that happened which opened my eyes was when i was a junior, i got pulled over by a cop for speeding on the way to class, and was talking with my classmates about it. my experience as a white woman was that i got pulled over, and given a warning. my white male classmates said the police officers in our town (this was in the south, just for reference) were usually cordial with them, but always gave them the ticket. the one black woman in the conversation said the police were a bit rude to her and she always got the ticket, and the two black men had some real horror stories about this stuff, how they were always made to get out of the car, were sometimes asked if they could search the car, etc. it was just so obvious how differently we were treated. from then on, i made more of an effort to understand where poc are coming from when they say something is an issue rather than just thinking it's not an issue because it's not an issue for me. i used to not believe people on stuff like that, which was pretty fucking racist of me, but just learning more about it and listening to people's experience really changed my mind."
7910	18740	2985	bnqk9j	en8gdiq	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i wasnt a self-proclaimed racist, i actually was very certain i wasnt racist at all. but then as i got older, i realized i had some underlying assumptions about people of color that werent correct, and were racist. what really changed my whole perspective was a video titled something like race doesnt exist and i was like, well that is dumb, but i clicked on it. among other things, the video showed a photo of barrack obama, and some famous white person i didnt know. the narrator said racially, what is the difference between these two people? in my mind, i was like, well one is black and one is white. the narrator said, both of these people have one black parent, and one white parent. and thats when it hit me. race doesnt exist. humans have a spectrum of skin color, some darker some lighter, but it doesnt make any difference where you are on that spectrum, youre just a human. we made up races to categorize people, but theyre all just made up boxes. theres nothing different between a black person and white person other than how much melanin is in your skin. thats it. i realized i had always had these underlying assumptions that people of other races were different than me. and then i realized they arent, and it changed the way i think about it and interact with my fellow humans. edit: i cant find the exact video, but heres one that covers much of the same material. https://youtu.be/vnfkgffcz7u

7942	18740	15	bnqk9j	en9hkej	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	not racist but grew up with no black ppl around until i moved to the us. i was the new kid in 2nd grade and the first one to talk to me was a black kid. we became friends and had to get separated in class because we talked too much. parents credit him for breaking me out my shell. they thought id be super quiet and have a hard time making friends. thanks to my boy wherever you are.

"i grew up in the country. i met someone that was different from me. that's really all there was to it. i really hate thinking back to all the casual racism, talking about how people are stealing jobs or different ways to beat/drag people. even if it wasn't intentionally racist just the little remarks about how x people do/like y. like people back home that didn't do it out of malice will still start off a sentance like ""we have a new doctor. he is black and ."" then get on with the story, like how is that relevant. i met all sorts of people and, wow, they are also just people. even if someone is actually different, like came from another country and culture, it is more interesting than intimidating now. same for homosexuality, i still have my religious beliefs but just let other people be how they are because it seems way more assholish to be hateful to someone than just ignore them over how they want to live their life. eventuslly judt realized people like you better when you give people the benefit of the doubt and act nice to them first instead of being hateful eith no reason."
7944	18740	7	bnqk9j	en9uli1	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up being told white people were the reason my life sucked and it always would. turns out the reason my life sucked is because my family dealt drugs and associated with terrible people. got out, got educated, things got better. life sucks for everyone who is poor.

7945	18740	7	bnqk9j	en92ojq	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up in a very racist family and was brought up to be racist i think the event that changed me was going to a very diverse middle school and making friends with a lot of people of different races and ethnicities :)
7946	18740	6	bnqk9j	en9i3yv	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	honestly there are not many black people in czech republic and also i spent my youth on on 4chan /pol/. i honestly believed back then that the black race is inferior in iq to the caucasian one. it took me many years and meeting many black people to realise that /pol/ screencaps and their statistics are very narrow minded and cherry picked. i am glad that i could throw away my old beliefs and become a person who is accepting of everyone. also i remember i first started hating /pol/s need to make themselves feel superior, since even if what they were saying was true no-one could do anything about it and it just sews hate between everyone, then i started working for a company and met ton of different cultures and races and figured out this is false entirely. it you think you are racist go out and meet the people you generalise, mostly it just your dumb brain. also i do not really condemn racists. most (at least in my country) are just people who do not care about a race of people who they do not meet and do not feel the need to prove their views they got from bad sources. i only condemn those that carry out their racism in front of someone from that race.
7947	18740	7	bnqk9j	en9uldg	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up fearing black people. every time we got robbed, it was a black person. my mom got dragged out of her car when she was pulling in to the driveway and it was by two black men. i grew up with this fear/hate because every time my family was hurt by outside forces it seemed to be black people. what finally took me out of that fear and hurt was when i found myself struggling when i was 18. this older black lady saw me crying cause i couldnt afford to pay for gas and was essentially stranded(i was living in my car at that point in time) she filled up my gas tank and gave me her number and told me if i ever needed gas money that basically she has my back. a complete stranger showing me compassion. the people that my parents told me to look out for when i was younger , they are the ones who lended a helping hand to me when i was at rock bottom. not even my own parents, my own blood offered to help. that resonated deeply within me. and honestly im happy it happened that way. i love all of you.
7948	18740	26	bnqk9j	en95871	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"i grew up in the rural south in the us. i was raised by a family of racists. both sets of grandparents and both parents told me horrible, horrible things growing up. here are things that i have heard/continue to hear from my family (i want to cry now as i write this). my paternal grandmother used to tell me that you can't trust n*****s because they are all theives and liars, that she would beat us (me and my brother) if we ever brought home a black girl, and that anyone who liked black people was a n*****-lover. my paternal grandfather used to regularly refer to president obama as a ""big-eared n*****"" and had a racist statue of a young black boy with pitch black skin and big, bright red lips eating a watermelon, on which he painted the word ""obama"" across the forehead. when my mother was a child, she was taken out of her school and moved an hour away just so she wouldn't have to go to school with black kids when the schools in the area were *finally* desegregated. her father has said, many times, that he would rather my brother and i be dead than marry a black woman (except he didn't say black). my grandmother on that side once told me that there were three things i better not ever do: (1) smoke, (2) drink, and (3) date a black girl (jokes on her, i've done all three). fun fact. both of my grandfathers are preachers. when i was a child, my mom used to have this exchange with me a lot: mom: ""guess what?"" me: ""what?"" mom: ""you're a n***** and i'm not."" i guess i've never really been a racist myself, but i have behaved in racist ways throughout my life in an effort to fit in. i only say all of this to show that racism is never something you are born with, it is something that the ignorant and weak-minded pass on to their children. what changed for me was that i realized that my family were uneducated, willfully ignorant, bigots who never questioned the awful things they were taught as children. i am grateful for the internet and technology, because without them, i may have ended up the same. i wish i could say that they are different now but in the age of donald trump, they have tripled down with their racism. i wish i could open their eyes to the things they don't see in the world, but now my only option has been to sever all ties with anyone other than my brother. we are super liberal now and despise our family."
7949	18740	28	bnqk9j	en8au88	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	not really ever a racist, but could have been. as a kid, racism was fairly normal. people applied labels to each other and assembled in groups that looked alike. in my area, there wasnt a lot of animosity or violence, but there was tension. as a kid, i was probably spared a lot of direct racism. at the same time, i realized that while my friends looked different, we were otherwise largely the same, focused on spelling and math and recess. the names were hurtful, and the divide unnecessary. we all agree to not perpetuate the things. since then, the differences in people are just visual. i prefer to celebrate and learn from the diversity and differences. honestly, i have a harder time with accents and colloquiums than i do with anyones origin, no matter how you choose to trace that. the problem is mine, too, not theirs, in that i just sometimes take a pass or two to get the sentiment or gist or straight verbiage because of yall instead of you all or whatever.
7950	18740	52	bnqk9j	en8k4dm	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"this is somewhat humourous but true nonetheless. i don't think i've ever been legitimately racist, i find the stance to be pretty immature tbh. but when i was young, probably less than 10, i had this silly idea that because black people were.well, not white, that they had to be messed up or something. my family wasn't racist either, i'm not sure where i got the idea. but i didn't like them. well one day, while visiting my grandparents who lived behind a gas station, my lil sis and i decided to walk over and get an icee and some snacks. so we went, got what we wanted and tried to pay. we were short some change, i didn't know what to do. but this colored man behind us paid for the rest of our stuff. it wasn't much, but to two little kids it was alot. on the way back to my grandparents house i told my sis, "" ya know, maybe black people aren't so bad after all."" i was weird."

7952	18740	13	bnqk9j	en9j4k6	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"not sure if this counts, but i was mormon once, and while mormons will tell you that they just don't agree with the concept of homosexuality, let me make this perfectly clear: mormons view gay people as a weird mix of richard simmons, and dracula. the belief that their lifestyle is fundamentally a sin, they actively engage in predatory behavior lure suspecting young men into this lifestyle. to top it off, i was homeschooled, so i never even met a gay person until my first job. he was about as stereotypical as could be, a hispanic, flamboyant, movie theater worker, one of several homosexual people that worked there. to go from having never had contact with such persons, to having about 6 i would regularly interact with over a week and in the weeks forward was.alarming. i was on guard constantly, generally avoided them when not directly being supervised by one, or asking questions of the others. anyway. back to the first guy. about 3 months of being employed, it's a school week tuesday. quiet as a tomb. it's just me and we'll call him joe. i looked at him, while restocking the fridge, and the question just popped into my head, and past my gums before i could stop it: ""joe, do you ever check out my ass when i'm bent over the popcorn or anything?"". joe, sassy latino queen that he was just replied without missing a beat ""honey, you don't look that much like brad pitt."". and that was all it took. being a rational man, and having observed them over 3 months, recognizing they didn't lure anyone to an untimely hiv ridden demise, hell, if anything, they seemed healthier than my bishop. they had never intended me any ill, i was just a coworker, and joe was just another guy, with an odd kink, looking for someone like him, and who the fuck was i to judge, i was a mormon into bondage. me and joe got on a lot better after that, alongside of the other guys that worked there. if you can challenge your preconceptions, you might learn something, and the world will be better for it."
7953	18740	71	bnqk9j	en8iwaq	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i was an overall piece of shit, trolled multiple groups of people. made racist jokes. i'm honestly not sure if i just enjoyed the attention, or if i honestly believed in the abhorrent shit i was spouting. i've changed a lot now, in my older years, and hold the line for those that can't. i came out as queer, am a feminist, and i try to be an honest politically correct person, without going overboard into militant behaviour.
7954	18740	6	bnqk9j	en93dlx	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	teenage rebellion mostly. i was raised in a fairly racist family where the n word was used regularly. the area where i grew up is still casually racist. when i hit my teen years, i guess i took a look at the beliefs i was raised with and realized they were mostly bullshit. i owe a huge debt of gratitude to my froend's parents for setting a much more tolerant example for me when i really needed to discover what i believed.
7955	18740	6	bnqk9j	en98u9r	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	not ex-racist, but ex-homophobe. i realized that i was wrong about non-straights, and i realized that i was being brainwashed by my extremely redneck homophobic mother. long story short, i try to ignore all the conservative hogwash she speaks, and i am actually closet bi-sexual.
7956	18740	6	bnqk9j	en9ivr8	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"i met a black person. that was pretty much all it took. i met her and got to know her and her friends and realized some are great and some suck, just like every other race. i grew up in the middle-of-no-where new hampshire. i only saw non-white people when we would take a school trip to a museum or other places. i only knew about people of color from the stereotypes on 80's tv and the racist remarks from my family. i laughed at all the racist jokes and ""knew"" white people were better than everyone, except maybe asians, because they were good at maths. black people were a drain on american society but that was our punishment for forcing them into slavery. my sophomore yeah in college i was randomly assigned a roommate and she was black. she might have been the first black person i ever really had a conversation with. i got to know her and her friends, most of who were also black. some of them i became very close friends with. one of my second cousins dated and had a child with a black man and some of my family shunned her. i was never brave enough to tell my family that while in college i also dated a black man and in a different life i could have saw us happily married. i didn't do very well in college and my dad still blames it on the fact that i was roomed with ""one of those"", but really it was because that was the year i started smoking pot and drinking because i finally had friends to go out with."
7957	18740	6	bnqk9j	en9l6ws	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	no event(s) in particular. i simply matured. i grew up in one of the more affluent counties in america, but i (white male) was a minority in my high school. essentially, year after year, we heard all about the plight of the minoritywe celebrated diversity (that is, anything non-white), even cheered black/latino pride groups. eventually, celebrating others ethnic groups while celebrating your own was implicitly taboo took its toll. it was very easy to fall into the why cant we have white heritage month? mindset. and honestly, thats all it wasa nave, sophomoric attitude, borne not of hate, but of (always) perceived and (often) actual alienation. im not saying we were justified in our views. indeed, we were no more justified in our views than the other side was in theirs.  that being said, the innocent why cant we have white heritage month? perspective is prone to exploitation by the far right, the same way other marginalized groups are prone to exploitation by the far left. in the end, we were all just useful idiotsat least until we educated ourselves.

"never was a rascist but had stereotypes. talked to a lebanese guy about a commercial depicting a woman putting on sexy lingerie under her burka. before that, i'd read an article about how all the muslim world was in rage over this commercial so my stupid teenage head assumed that this muslim guy would be offended. so i showed him the commercial and asked how he felt about it. ""this makes me horny!"" was his response."

7960	18740	5	bnqk9j	en9t5eh	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up hearing that white people were evil and secretly controlled society and the cause of all the world's ills, and that almost all racism was whites being racist to nonwhites. but then i met a lot of white people and they were almost all really nice. plus i learned that warfare, slavery, etc. have been very common worldwide for all of known history and western civilization was the first to get rid of it.
