"didn't see it but heard it. my friends and i got a cheap set of walkie-talkies from walmart and were playing around with them in the middle of the day. there's a bit of silence as we're trying to figure out the volume and out of nowhere there's a male voice saying ""mayday mayday mayday"" that comes through all of our walkie talkies and it definitely sounds like it from one of those aircraft headsets. we try to answer back but there's no response. i called non emergency but they said there weren't any reports of distressed aircraft or ships and even if there were, they couldn't do anything about it. alternatively, a couple months later i saw a plane with an engine on fire go over my campus but apparently no one else did."
2979	41514	2227	bt3zc7	eouj2s2	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was 7 or 8, i would have a reoccurring nightmare that one of my dolls came to life, played with me, and then would try to pull me into my closet with her. id follow her into the closet at first, but then shed show me this little door at the back of the closet, and my heart would start to race. i dont know what it was about that door, but i knew something bad would happen if i went through it. id start to struggle and try to pull away, but the doll was too strong and would start pulling me through the door. at this point in the dream, id always wake up screaming. the worst part was i had night terrors, so sometimes id wake up standing next to my closet. every night before bed, id make my parents make sure there wasnt a little door at the back of my closet. there never was. anyway, i was talking to my mom the other day and this dream came up. im laughing about it and how ridiculously paranoid i was about dolls and that closet, but my mom gets really quiet. she tells me the creepy part of that dream wasnt the doll; it was the fact that there used to be a little door at the back of the closet, but when i was one year old, they remodeled the house and put a wall where the door used to be. theres no way i could have remembered that door, but years later, i kept dreaming about it. none of my friends believe this story, but i swear its true.
2980	41514	613	bt3zc7	eou7lyz	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i grew up on a 2 acre home with plenty of trees and room for an 8 yr old to run around. our house also was heated in winter by a wood fireplace, so we would periodically cut down one of our own trees to save money. well for about 2 years, there was a stump less then a foot tall near the house, and at least once a day, without fail, i would see someone standing on the stump. usually it was out of the corner of my eye, but once or twice i looked directly at him. i always looked away quickly, cuz it startled me and he was gone, but my sister says she experienced the same thing. nothing ever came of it tho
2981	41514	277	bt3zc7	eoulfd5	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	growing up, i had a friend named adam. he was never able to come out dyeing the day, only right before all of us kids had to go home for the evening. adam lived a few houses over, in a house with an overgrown yard. i met his parents once. they were very strange, didn't smile, and obviously didn't want me there. i remember adam telling me that he was sick, that's why he couldn't play that much. he was a small boy, pale with dark hair. eventually, adam stopped showing up all together. and i eventually moved on, though i do remember going to his house a couple times to see if he could come play, and his dad just gave me this look before closing the door in my face. later in life, i asked my sister if she remembered him. she doesn't, and according to my parents - that house was empty the entire time we lived there. i don't know who adam was, i don't know why i so vividly remember him and his parents. as far as i can tell, he wasn't real - and yet i have perfect memories of him and his parents.
2982	41514	2278	bt3zc7	eoukzoc	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	alright, buckle in. my neighbor was dying of a heart condition about 6 years ago. he knew he was, so he was giving away his valuables to people he trusted with them. neighbor gave me his tackle box. he loved to fish. i would see him come home from fishing every day and hed just sit on his porch and skin fish. i just put the tackle box in my closet and didnt really do anything with it since i dont fish. anyways, soon after, he passed away in his home. exactly a week after that, i woke up to the tackle box at the foot of my bed. weird, but my stepdad likes to dick around, figured it was him, so i put it back. the next morning, i wake up, its at the foot of my bed again. so, i ask my stepdad what the deal was, and he had no idea what i was talking about. to test this, i put the tackle box in a spot that he wouldnt find, nor would he attempt to get it. under my bed, all the way in the back against the wall, and i put stuff in front of it to conceal it. next morning, nothing. okay, i guess it was him. didnt give it much thought after that. 3 days pass, i wake up one morning and there it is, at the foot of my bed. fuck. now im starting to freak out. so i did what any rational person would and i went fishing with it. after i went fishing, i put the tackle box away, and it hasnt moved since then. its still there.
2983	41514	7944	bt3zc7	eoucln6	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"just after high school, maybe six months or so after 9-11, i was a van driver who drove the meals for meals on wheels to the place where they get packaged up and taken for home delivery. anyway the delivery van only had am/fm radio and i was listening to 92.5 fm, when all of a sudden the station cuts out and a transmition that i can only describe as an american version of a numbers station began playing. it was seemingly random nymbers followed by a long period of the same phrase repeated over and over again. the phrase was ""they took the crosstown bus"", over and over again. none of the other drivers heard it but man was it creepy to hear. eventually the regular radio station came back on and they never mentioned anything about it."
2984	41514	600	bt3zc7	eoue89j	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this happened to me last year and i fully understand why no one believed me because it sounds rediculous. every morning, i need to wake up at 5 am to get the 5:30 bus to the train station to go to university. i had to be there by 8 am, but i like to get there half an hour early. to get to the bus stop, i have to walk down this bike path and under this bridge to get to this quiet backstreet road. there is fuck all light on the bike path. this street is dead quiet. the right side of the road is a continuation of the bike path, and the left is a normal footpath with a long green hedge. one morning, i was standing there waiting for a bus and this old women comes walking out from under the bridge. i didn't see her at first because as i said it was pitch black on the bike path. she crosses the road and walks up to me. she asked me if i knew where x road was. i turned to point in the direction of the road she was looking for. i turned back and she was gone. this old women who was walking at a snails pace dissapeared within 3 seconds.
2985	41514	5172	bt3zc7	eou2shz	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	the scariest thing i saw was at the age of 16, i woke up early in the morning (4:30-5-ish am) me and some friends were supposed to go on a roadtrip for the weekend (we had a long af ride to one of the stops we wanted to visit, and didn't wanna be there too late) i look out my window and it's still a kinda dark outside, i walk downstairs and see wet footprints all over the house, and suddenly a big man (like 6'7''. i was around 6'1'' at the time) just bolt past me and out the front door. not really creepy, but i shat at least 5 bricks and bolted upstairs to my dad. nothing got stolen, but things were scattered all over the house.
2986	41514	537	bt3zc7	eouklks	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	about 8 years ago now i was taking a drive out to kansas from the east coast. i was with a friend and we were going out to see her grandparents. once we were about 2 hours from the grandparents house my friend starts outlining standard operating procedures of seeing things in and around her familys home. she seemed a bit panicky when going over everything but i managed to calm her down. im skeptical of everything and assured her that the things she had seen when she was a small child were just manufactured in her imagination. she insisted that the entire family had seen these things with the exception of her grandparents. 2 hours later, we arrive in kansas and im ready to fall over because of the length of time the last leg of the trip took. we are welcomed and grandmother takes me to a back bedroom and just as she about to close the door; she stops, says maybe you shouldnt stay in this room and escorts me to another room. ok, that was a little strange but whatever, im tired. fast forward to night #2 at the grandparents home. its around 11pm and my friend is crashed out on the couch watching tv. im in an adjacent bedroom from which i can see her laying on the couch. i nod off for the night and wake up to a old grey man that bared a resemblance to the grandfather but was not the grandfather standing with his back to me in the doorway looking at my friend sleeping on the couch. i decided i was going to get up and confront the old grey man and something slammed me back into the bed. i tried to get up several more times with the same result. each time i was slammed back into the bed a voice would repeat put a seal on the door finally, i snapped to its 3 am and everything was normal. i must have been sleeping. it was a dream. no old grey man and my friend was fast asleep. so i start pacing around the room trying to decide how i feel about what had just happened. i glance over to my friend her eyes are open and she says you seen it. i say, get in the car, i cant be here right now. we spend the next 4 hours sitting in a walmart parking lot talking about the history of her experiences in that house and comparing to my own. ok, my nerves are not on fire anymore and we are heading back to the grandparents home. we arrive and they are waiting for us inside. i tell them exactly what happened to me and i get yeah, thats strange. we usually do seal our doors with a prayer at night but with all the excitement we just must have forgotten. all the children have mentioned stories of things but we have never seen them. we are sorry you had to go through that. im really not sure what i seen or experienced that night but when i tell people they get that look of skepticism. its obvious they dont believe me. my conclusion is that the experience was indistinguishable from reality in the moment. i dont know what that means but it changed the way i look at things.
2987	41514	2863	bt3zc7	eoubqyu	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this was 4 years ago. as i was walking on the sidewalk on a busy afternoon, i saw a suspicious boy/man about 18 yo. he was 10 meters away and walking what it looked like towards me. i kept my eyes on him despite the fact that he wasnt looking directly at me, his eyes were roaming jumping from an object to an object. as we approached one another, half a meter away from each other he takes out a knife and tries to stab me in my left side. he wasnt really fast, so i easily dodged it and immediately turn to see who is he, or if he is trying to stab me again. to my surprise he continues walking and after couple of meters he stopes turns around smiles and gives me thumbs up, then he continues walking in the opposite direction. till this day i dont know who he was, what he wanted and even my family doesnt believe me, because if someone wanted to stab you, you cant stop him. you arent experienced enough to dodge it like that and something of that kind. edit: thank you for the rewards! those are my first ones so i dont know what do they do. thank you!!!!
2988	41514	9107	bt3zc7	eou86yl	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i woke up to something, it sounded like a door shutting. at first i thought it was a dream because i could hear it in the dream as i was waking up, kinda like when someone calls your name when youre dreaming. but then i looked at my cat, his hair was completely standing up and he was beaming at my bedroom door. this was the moment when i got really scared bc i know animals can pick up on that shit and i thought he might know somethings wrong. my cat doesnt do this type of thing unless a dog is in the room. so i looked over at the door and the only way i can describe it is it looked like it was swaying, slowly, like it was breathing, like someone was standing on the other side of it trying to hear if i was awake. this swaying was accompanied by a shadow. *i dont mean a supernatural shadow, but it looked like the shadow of a person behind the door. i was paralyzed in fear. i lied there for 5 minutes naked watching this door away. i considered yelling and trying to scare them away but i was terrified someone might respond. i legitimately thought this was the moment where i will have to defend myself or be killed. i dont own a gun but after 10 minutes or so i mustered up the courage to check every room in the house. i fucking checked every corner too. but there was no one there. i dont know what happened, but my evolutionary traits kicked in and i completely believed someone was outside my door. edit: the, accompanied by a shadow part was not a shadow figure, it was like the shadow youd see if something was on the other side of a cracked door. i dont know if that makes the story less scary or what, but just wanted to be clear.
2989	41514	614	bt3zc7	eoucs1m	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"this makes me sound fucking crazy but anyways: &#x200b; it was a warm summer morning back when i was a kid. i was standing in our hallway, putting on my shoes when i randomly peeked into our living room and saw a see-through male figure surrounded by rainbow coloured light standing right in the middle of the living room. he was reading a book and didn't seem to notice me. i thought it was weird but i didn't feel scared or anything. it felt like the room was filled with a warm, loving energy if that makes sense. i kinda just shrugged it off and went about my day, probably because i was too young to really understand what i'd seen. a few days later when my mom tucked me into bed she read me a bedtime story about a kid who meets an angel or something like that, don't remember the story exactly but what is interesting is the authors description of what that angel looked like. it was exactly the same as the strange rainbow man i had seen in our living room a couple of days before. it even said that angels will often visit humans surrounded by a strong, rainbow coloured lightening and manifest themselves while reading a book*.* &#x200b; i casually blurted out:""*oh, i've seen an angel then!""* and my mom was like:""*you have? that's great!""* and we didn't talk more about that for a while until one day where i randomly asked my mom if i could see a picture of my grandad who died unexpectedly while my mom was pregnant with me.she found an old family album and we looked through pictures of my parents' wedding that happened exactly one year before i was born. there was a picture of three or four people sitting together, laughing and having a great time at the party. i immediately pointed out the guy who sat in the middle and said:*""how funny! he looks just like the angel i saw!!""* and my moms face turned white as a ghost. she was just about to tell me that this was indeed my deceased grandfather who i never got to meet. i'm very convinced it was him visiting me."
2990	41514	1163	bt3zc7	eou6z6e	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i spent one summer in high school living with my aunt and uncle and keeping their seven year old daughter for them during the day while they worked. i was up late one night watching tv in the living room. the living room was right off of the kitchen, separated only by an l shaped bar. i saw my cousin, out of the corner of my eye, walk down the hallway from her room into the kitchen. it was way past her bedtime, so i told her she needed to go back to bed. when i didnt hear her answer, i got up and walked around the bar and into the kitchen. there was no one there. i checked under the bar to see if she was hiding from me, and there was no one there, and no where else she couldve gone from the kitchen. i walked down the hallway to her room, and she was fast asleep, snoring, so there was no way it was her. it baffled me, and freaked me out, because if i didnt see my cousin, who was the little girl that walked into the kitchen? several years later, i was talking to my aunt and she nonchalantly brings up the ghost in her house. i laughed it off and she said, no, im serious. we have a ghost. your uncle and i both have seen her and heard her. we call her giggles, because we hear her giggling. we usually only see her in the hallway before she disappears. all of a sudden, i remembered the disappearing girl in the kitchen. i asked her what her ghost looked like. she said she had blonde hair with braids and wore a white dress. my cousin is blonde. on the night in question, i thought id seen my cousin in a nightgown walk down the hallway, but apparently it was the ghost that resides in my aunts house.
2991	41514	4184	bt3zc7	eou2og1	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"fishing on lake minnewanka in banff national park with a good freind. about 50 feet from shore. around 8:30 pm i see glowing red eyes. up in the trees. like . red. like predator i guess. i do a double - take. they are gone. i decide not to say anything, maybe i'm trippin. did just smoke up. nope. 5 mins later my buddy says ""i just seen some glowing red eyes up in the top of those trees."" i feel goosebumps. ""yup, i saw them too"". we look back and they are gone. we decide to aim the boat towards the shoreline. it's not dark yet but sun is going down. we saw nothing. no owls, no goats in the trails. we didn't get off the boat but we had a good look around. when i ask him about it (this was around 10 years ago) he just says he doesn't want to talk about it. i can't blame him. but after all these years i've never heard or seen anything like those glowing red eyes, 30 - 40 feet up in the trees. staring at us. i copied and pasted this next part, i knew nothing about the history when we went fishing there. ""for more than 100 centuries, people hunted and camped along the original shores of lake minnewanka. the stoney people called it minn-waki or lake of the spirits. they respected and feared this lake for its resident spirits. the early europeans called it devil's lake."" i used to go camping there. i do not any more. mostly because it's bear country for most of the summer. but yeah also because of those bright red eyes. i will never forget that. most surreal thing i've ever seen."
2992	41514	15073	bt3zc7	eou2ybt	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i saw a panther sized black cat darting out of a water retention/artificial forest near a school in the desert. logically, it shouldn't be able to survive there but holy shit i saw it. animal control wouldn't let that exist, there isn't really food enough for it, and the summers get dangerously hot if you've got black fur. must have been 4-5 feet long. it doesn't make sense, but i 100% saw it, and so did the friend i was with.

2994	41514	45827	bt3zc7	eotzubs	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i used to have a buddy that lived in the same neighborhood, a few streets over. one night we were having a couple of beers in his backyard while playing cards. i had some things to do the next morning so just before ten i said my good-byes and shoved off. it was a short walk (maybe 15 minutes door-to-door) so i never drove. anyway, it was a nice night. uneventful trip. but when i got home, my roommate was coming out the front door, coffee in hand, and dressed for work. he gave me a funny look and said he thought i was asleep since my truck was in the driveway. i told him where i'd been and asked why he was going in to work at night. that's when he kind of laughed and asked if i was drunk. we stared at each other for a minute and then he told me it was just after 5 in the morning and he was going in just like he usually did. in my entire life, i'd never felt more confused than i did in that moment. i could tell he was dead serious but i knew i had just left my friend's house. i checked my phone and sure enough. 5-something in the am. my roommate left for work. i paced circles in the living room for a bit then called the friend whose house i'd just left. he groggily answered and confirmed i'd left at ten the previous evening. i have no idea what happened during those 7 hours of my life and it gives me chills to think about it all these years later. i wasn't drunk, i wasn't tired, no one could have slipped anything in either of the two coors lights i'd had.no known medical conditions that would have caused me to blackout, and nothing has happened like it since. i just don't know what happened to that time.
2995	41514	12952	bt3zc7	eotvvlf	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not quite sure how young i was at the time but it was probably between 5-8. i was in my babysitter bed at the time in her trailer park. it was 3:00am i had woken up because i had to pee. when i woke up i looked down the hallway to see my babysitter leaning against the wall like one of the stereotypical cool guys do in movies. and i made eye contact and i felt my body go cold because she was still sound asleep next to me in bed. i went under the blankets trying to hide and when i looked back she was gone. i didnt want to sound crazy so ive never told anyone. i just sat in her bed watching infomercials until 6:00am when she woke up. never even thought about sleeping there again. i honestly forget how much this affected me until i started writing this. really freaked me out man. edit: since i never told anyone idk if it belongs here, but no one in my family believes in ghost, so if i were to tell them i guarantee itd be dismissed.
2996	41514	977	bt3zc7	eouf8t5	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	two stories here, both about my grandma. near the end my grandma had trouble controlling her bowels, wore a diaper and would typically go all over the toilet. after she passed(she passed in the house under professional care) my family cleaned out the house, took the wallpaper down, cleaned the place spotless, because we were going to move in in the next month or two. about a week after we finished cleaning we went back to make sure everything was good, we get to the bathroom my grandma used and there was literal shit everywhere, the walls, the ceiling, behind the shower curtain, literally the entire bathroom was essentially coated. freaked me out because i knew it had to be my grandma, no burst pipes or anything wrong with the plumbing. second story: we ended up moving in after the shituation. my parents were out of town, so my brother and i had some friends over, we were in the basement playing magic the gathering when i went upstairs to grab everyone drinks. in line of sight from the fridge was the tv in our family room, out of nowhere the tv turns on full volume to the show the commissioner, which was my grandmas favorite show, she was also hard of hearing so it being at full volume was normal for her. i freaked the fuck out and ran into the basement to get my brother, we go upstairs and the tv is off but the recliner is reclined. i shouldnt have been scared because it had to be my grandma, but i young. we lived in that house a few more years and a few other things happened but those two stick out to me because they were so close to when she died
2997	41514	26449	bt3zc7	eotveh8	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i was walking to class from the dining hall on my campus when i saw a lady yelling for help and banging on a window of a nearby building. lots of people were walking past but i was the only one who seemed to acknowledge it. i went to the window to help and she told me she was locked in a room in the building and that she needed me to come in and open the door. now, i have no idea the layout of this building and where she was located. so i decided to call campus security for help despite her pleading with me not to call them and to just let her out. i call them and when i hear them coming i go to greet them so i can take them to the window. i leave for maybe a maximum of fifteen seconds and when i return with campus security she is gone. we can't see her at the window and campus security goes inside to double check and sure enough there is no trace of her. campus security definitely thought i was crazy and i'm sure my professor thought i was full of shit when i explained to him why i was late. no one seems to believe me that this happened but i swear it did. faqs: i am female/it is a very old campus with lots of random historic buildings that people don't really use and this building was one of them/the area has a very high crime rate so it probably was a robbery
2998	41514	143	bt3zc7	eouafg8	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ooh! i have a story. my husband(then bf) and i were laying on his trampoline one night looking up at the stars and shit when all of a sudden a chunk of the sky starts moving/billowing. it looked like a green screen shifting, and had to be a few miles wide. we both saw it and still have no fucking idea what it could have been.
2999	41514	3019	bt3zc7	eouagvc	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ok so i was flicking through these and told my girlfriend about one and she hit me up with these stories. just some background she is a dedicated science brain and not superstitious at all. when she was growing up (~4 to ~15 years of age) she would often wake up in the middle of a disturbed sleep to see an old women perched at the end of her bed. this women was not someone that she recognised. the old lady would sooth her back to sleep often patting her feet at the end of her bed. the strange thing about this is her sister (a few years older) also had similar experiences seeing the old lady. they both shared a room, but would see her at different times. we doubt very much it was someone coming into their rooms at night. both her and the sister also recalled seeing a man popping his head out from behind their tall kitchen cupboard, smiling and then going back behind it. turns out that from his description the family believed it was a neighbour who passed away and used to play hide and seek with them and his children. personally, i've never experienced anything supernatural. found reading this thread and talking to her about it very interesting :). edit: thanks for all the votes and comments. one of my first big posts on reddit great seeing the love! we both woke up all giddy. my gf divulged further that the house they lived in used to be owned by and elderly women who kept it super clean and was a very caring member of the community. apparently she died 3 days after they signed the lease.
3000	41514	716	bt3zc7	eouek7z	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"this might end up buried but i'm going to add it anyways. i work night shift at a hospital and during the night it's fairly common for us to run out of particular supplies that we need. during the day, there is normally a worker from central supply that you can call and they'll bring up what you need directly to your floor. but at night, we don't have that luxury so we often have to go down and get it ourselves. central supply is the basement of this hospital that has been around since the 40's, so it's creepy enough. i had heard stories about how creepy it was and people getting uneasy feelings while down there alone. i was naive and didn't really believe it until one night i had to go down there by myself. the place is huge and dimly lit with rows of shelves of hospital supplies everywhere. i'm in the middle of these shelves looking for what i need when i just start to feel a shiver run through my entire body. the hair on my neck is standing up and i just get this feeling of complete dread, like i'm not supposed to be there. then all of a sudden i see this black figure dart passed me out of the corner of my eye. at first i thought i was just seeing things because it's like 3am and i'm tired so i brush it off. i go to leave and suddenly i hear a huge crash behind me. a variety of supplies were wiped completely off the shelf and all over the floor and in the corner of the room, i just see this black figure like thing standing there. every hair on my body is standing up at this point and i get my ass out of that place as fast as possible. i came back to my floor and all but one of my coworkers thought i was bluffing. the only one who believed me saw my face and without me saying anything said to me, ""you saw it too, didn't you?"" &#x200b; yeah, i never went down in the basement ever again lol. edit: grammar, inevitably due to writing this during night shift lmfao"

"no one ever believes me when i tell them this except the few people that are involved. my dad thinks we are just to imaginative even though my mom and i will tell the exact same stories at different times, never having talk to each other but any way here's what i have to contribute it's a copy&paste btw. i've told this story on reddit before my story starts when i was roughly 8. my parents bought an old farm house that's over 100 years old ( we found news paper clippings in the wall when they renovated it from 1864). i had 2 brothers at the time and we were all outside playing and they had a tendency to pick on me, so i decided i was done putting up with it and went in the house to tattle (as year olds do). i yelled several times for my mom and finally got back. "" what is it dear*?"" not seeing her i yell ""where are you?"" again i hear a voice ""i'm over here dere."" i dont see her and call out again. this repeats about 4 times and as i get closer and the voice gets louder. i passed by a window and glanced out to see my mom and dad out in the distance working on a tractor. my heart jumps into my throat and i book it outside. my brothers are exactly where they were when i went in so i know it's not one of them messing with me. throughout the years i hear voices and tv's and strange noises constantly throughout the house but just assume i'm hearing things move up a bit to me being 17. parents left town for a few days and i had some friends come over. night starts off normal we play some video games and all is well. 2 of my friends need to use the bathroom so one goes down stairs and one stays upstairs since theres 2 bathrooms in the house. first friend comes back from the bathroom and says "" yea yes really funny guys"" to the 3 of us that are in the room. we have no idea what he talking about. he said ""banging on the door and making weird sounds while i'm taking a piss, soooooo funny."" we are all genuinely confused as we haven't moved. he doesn't believe us but sits down and rejoins the group. now the second friend comes back from downstairs and has a similar complaint. he says we were bouncing a ball, shuffling things around laughing outside the door and heard us run off when the toilet flushed. we again are confused especially since there weren't enough of us to mess with both of them at the same time. conversation kind of drops but neither seem convinced we did nothing a couple hours go by and for some reason the conversation comes up again. we deny it they dpnt believe it. eventually that turns into jokes a out ghosts and how we disturbed them when the house was remodeled(i was about 13 when we started remodeling). jokes continue and someone said, "" ah come on now you cant really believe that ghosts exist?"" and everyone is like nahh they probably dont. on the other side of the room is a single-fold closet door and right as we said that this door explodes open so violently that the folds slam together and bounce almost back shut. we immediately end that conversation, flip every light in the house on and no one dared to touch that door. the next day i wanted to make sure something didnt fall, but as i open the door there is nothing close to the door a d nothing big enough that even could have fallen to slam that door open. move forward to me being 20 and telling my mom of the weird things that i witnessed. she tells me "" oh i know theres at least a family of 3 that i know of. 2 little boys one always has a bouncing ball and the other giggles a lot and an old man"" i hadn't even gotten to that part in my story. edit:dear* cause apparently this is a hot button issue for y'all"

(since my brother was really into creepy stuff at the time, he was 14) one day this guy just disappeared. the next thing i knew was that one of my friends kept seeing the guy everywhere. she many times pointed that the guy was outside the school gate watching her, i never saw him on the otherside of the gate. then she told me the guy disappeared after a few weeks. then this other kid started telling everyone about the guy following him. about 7 months passed and i moved to another town. still gives me creeps. edit: for the people asking what he looked like, he was a ginger head, not really good looking :/ and that's all i remember.

"about a decade ago, i was helping my sister and her husband move into their new apartment. it was in a far off city, so i couldn't exactly drive home right after we were done, and their place was also pretty cramped. i decided to spend the weekend at her friend's (who i'll call mary) house for my bus back home on monday. now, mary is a widow. i'm also a guy. keep that in mind. when i first got to mary's house, i was immediately hit by how unwelcoming the place felt. she was really nice, but the house just ""felt"" angry, as if i was an intruder. the building was also ice cold despite it being summer and there being no ac. it was off putting to say the least but i just chalked it up to nerves. mary starts to show me around the house, but a feeling of profound unease begins to steadily creep up on me, starting right in my gut. something is seriously off about this place, but i don't know what exactly. one room was her husband's study. it looked completely untouched since what i was guessing was the time of his death: files, books, computer and keyboard, pens and pencils, and even a coffee mug. all of it was covered in some serious dust. the room didn't look exactly ominous but it was certainly bizarre. she finally leads me to the guest room and i start to get ready to turn in. it's about 11 pm. i leave the one luggage bag i brought on the floor, change into my pajamas, lay in bed and try to get to sleep. a few hours later at about 1 or 1:30, i wake up to what sounds like footsteps. i don't worry too much about it, thinking it's probably mary on her way to the bathroom or something. then something hits me like a brick. these footsteps are far too deep and far too loud to belong to mary. they sound like the footsteps of a bigger guy. now, i'm sweating bullets but all i can really do is stay still and try to go back to sleep. for good while, all i can hear is the steady pacing of a large man just outside the door. i swear, at some moments it felt like whatever the fuck it was, was walking right into the room. i eventually fall back asleep. i wake up again at about 3 or 3:30. this time it felt like someone or something was pinning the covers from below the bed so that i couldn't move. i'm terrified and almost paralyzed in fear. after a few moments of struggling, i manage to get the covers off and then the bed starts to violently shake. i grab my phone and fucking take off. i hustle down the stairs in my pjs and call a taxi to get to a hotel since i'm way too spooked to stay any longer. once i get off the phone, i quickly go back into the house to get my stuff from the guest room. i will never forget what i saw next. as i open the door to my room, to my total and utter horror, i see that my luggage has been carefully placed on my bed, opened, and the contents have been completely strewn about. i practically shit a brick, scramble to get my stuff into my bag, and sprint out of the house. i haven't been over at mary's house since edit 1: formatting, spelling, and some extra deets edit 2: i never spoke to mary about this in detail, but she did ask me why i left in such a hurry. i told her that i couldn't sleep since the house was so cold. she clearly wasn't believing me, but we both just silently agreed to let it slide. i'd later find out from my sister (who i also did not tell very much to) that mary's husband had killed himself in the guest room."

"i guess this isn't super scary, and idk if it really fits, but it still weirds me out and my friends just think i'm crazy. back when i was a freshman in college i went out with a friend of mine. he ended up dancing with some girl, so i went and grabbed a seat at the bar. girl came up to me and bought me a drink because she ""liked my style"" and introduced herself as sapphire. we chatted for at least an hour, had a few drinks, and at some point she said she had to leave, so i asked for her number and she scribbled it on to a bar napkin. but then we ended up chatting more and one thing led to another and she invited me to her apartment. we go there and start hooking up and she asks if i've ever tried acid and if i wanted to do some. i said sure. after it kicks in we go for a walk, we were talking about the constellations and space for a while, but then i noticed she got quiet. i had my eyes glued to the sky for the entire walk, so i look over. and she's gone. i freak out and start retracing my steps to get back to her place, yelling her name and checking bushes (my high ass assumed she was just peeing in a bush). get back to her apartment, knock on the door, and some guy answers the door. keep in mind this was like 4am at this point. some guy answers and i ask if he knew sapphire and described her. he said he had no clue who i was talking about and to just go home. so i did, i ended up crashing at a friend's place because my trip was going south and i knew he'd be able to calm me down. next day comes and i'm still trying to figure out what happened to her. i call the number she gave me. it was disconnected. went back to the apartment, same guy answers, still no idea what i'm talking about. even knocked on some of the neighbors, and tried the same room location on different floors. nothing. talked to the security guy at the front desk, said he remembers me coming in a few times, but never saw me with a girl. called up my friend who was at the bar with me and asked if he saw the girl i was with. he said he never saw me with a girl, according to him i was sitting at the bar alone for a bit, had a few drinks, and left after like 30 minutes. i have no idea who this woman was, or if she even existed, but i remember her so vividly i can't believe that i imagined it. she just vanished, i have no tangible proof of her existence. freaks me out to this day that i spent an entire night with this person who didn't exist. i still don't know what happened that night."

3011	41514	245	bt3zc7	eouik55	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	as a marine, i used to have the graveyard patrol shift at the beirut bombing memorial. part of the memorial is dedicated to a veteran's cemetary. oddly enough i never got freaked out being completely alone in a remote cemetery, in the middle of the night, surrounded by dense woods on all sides. it was actually kind of peaceful, to be honest. however, one night i was patrolling near the perimeter fence where some of the oldest headstones are, when i heard the sound of a woman humming. i followed the sound and noticed a light glowing through the vines and brush of a large tree. as i approached, i could literally feel my hair beginning to lift as if there was an electric current in the air. i pushed aside the brush and what i saw nearly took my breath away. it was an old, weathered headstone with a large cross etched into the marble. only the cross was glowing a bright, vivid blue, like a neon bulb. the humming was also suddenly much louder and had a weird plurality to it, like it was coming from hundreds of voices at once. needless to say, i freaked the fuck out. i screamed like a scared little girl and sprinted back to the parking lot. i radioed the guard who was supposed to relieve me and forced him to come early, then spent the rest of my shift in the cab of his truck. i don't think he believed me, but he stayed in his truck and didn't go out on patrol until the sun was fully up. a few days later, i worked up the nerve to return to the grave (during the day, of course). as i suspected, in the light of day it was a completely mundane headstone. there was no name, only the aforementioned cross. i ran my hands over the stone and checked to see if maybe there was some sort of hidden light source or solar panel, but no, it was just plain, solid, unremarkable stone. the humming was gone, too. i eventually returned to my normal shift, but never again experienced anything out of the ordinary. i never learned whose grave that was, either, but i find myself thinking about it from time to time. it certainly sounds absurd when i say it out loud, and i suppose it could have been a hallucination or a trick of my tired brain, but i don't believe it was. i think it was real; a ghost or spirit of some sort, but i don't think it was malevolent at all.

"this may be long and it isn't a ""no one believes me/us"" scenario due to the amount of us involved, more of ""a lot of skepticism"" thing. back story: (you'll need it) i grew up in a small california desert tourist town called joshua tree. home of the joshua tree national park (those of us that are older call it ""the monument"" as it was that before national parkdom). i was in my early 20's at the time of this, which was approximately 14 years ago, and was the only one with a car and a license. growing up in a small desert town leaves you will limited options for fun and we would make use of the park. occasionally, maybe once a week or so, a group of us would pile in to the station wagon with beer, smokes and a mix tape and drive through the park late at night. an empty road, so dark and quite other than the loud group of guys in a red mercury driving fast from one enterance to another. hours would go by each time as we drove the long desolate road and stopped at various rocks we liked to climb. and i can't understate how desolate it was. how alone. no other cars, no lights. except the occasional road work sign when warranted. hell, that was exactly what we thought it was. this trip started like every other, except maybe more of us than usual. crammed in that car, windows down as i chain smoked and drove a good 20mph over the speed limit, gravel spitting up as we had a good time. shortly in to the trip i saw a light. a blue light. possibly (and it was) miles and miles ahead. that is the thing about dark, light is free to shine. i remember saying something about having to slow down at some point ahead, must be some road construction left by itself up ahead. had to be a sign, the light hadn't moved. we continued for a few miles to one of our favorite stops and got out. we climbed for a while, maybe 45 minutes or so. drank a little. joked. the norm. then we piled back in and continued. let me be clear, this light never moved and we had already been about an hour in to our adventure. why would the sign have a blue light?? as we approached the light i started to slow. and slowed more and more as we approached the source. it wasn't a sign, it wasn't a car, it wasn't a ufo. standing on the side of the road, facing towards us unmoving for over an hour at this point, was a man. a pale white man, white beard, dirty old miner clothing with an old mining helmet and a pickaxe. his light giving off an unnatural blue light. his face blank but he stared at us, directly at all of us. we sped up and as we drove by faster, his head turning to keep pace with us as we left. his light visible, unmoving once again, facing us the entire trip out. i remember looking at the car clock shortly after passing him, it was damn near exactly 1:00 am when we passed him. we never saw a car, hell. a horse, any way for this old sickly pale miner to get in to the park, nor any reason for him to be there. worst of all we estimated that this miner had to have been standing there, facing us, for at least an hour and a half never moving. not once did that light flicker as if he looked down for a moment, or turned his head. he just stood there staring down a road at a car full of dumbasses. we never saw him again. however, a couple of years ago i decided to check to see if anyone experienced the same. i found one other story of a couple that saw him near where we did. standing there, staring late at night. as a man i wish we would have stopped. even if it would have been the most horrifying thing ever, i wish we would have stopped because i honestly believe there was a ghost of a dead miner out in that park and i would know for sure today."

"on mobile, so i apologize beforehand. it's kinda a long one, it'll be my first long post, so i hope you enjoy. tl;dr at the bottom. my mom runs an antique business and has for years. i've worked with her on various occasions, often changing between working the shop with her and doing construction with my dad. for awhile, she ran her business a few towns over with my best friend's dad, and the business was ok, but didn't make enough to support the both of them. well, a few years back, she sold her ownership to him, and just boxed up some of her things from the shop to bring home. my dad, however, surprised her and rented her a building in our home town so she could run her own shop. she quickly brought everything there and began unpacking. while unpacking, i found an old ouiji board from an estate sale she had bought out. i showed her, we joked about the creepyness of it, and she said when she'd gotten it, her coworker had jokingly played with it to tease her (our family isn't super religious, but we ain't about tempting demons lol). she thought he'd thrown it away, but apparently he'd snuck it into her stuff as a final prank. so, we laughed, and she tossed it in the garbage pile. a few months later, i was running the front desk when she brought a box of antiques to price down from the attic. we began going through it and what happened to be in the bottom of the box? the ouiji board, still in it's cardboard case, planchette underneath. i recognized it as the same one (the box had the same tears and dents i remembered). mom and i looked at each other, and after much debating, threw it away. again. well, in about 2017, mom stopped opening the shop (we weren't making too much while open), and instead started buying out estate sales or helping them run it, then buying what was left over to take to the shop (which we still owned). it became a storage house for antiques she hoped to one day sell. this last week (may 20th i believe?) she asked me to help buckle down and clear out damaged junk from the shop. we began going through boxes and boxes and moving them to a trailer to take to a garage sale location. as i was shuffling a box through to the back area to load it, i heard my mother shout, ""no. f***ing. way."" i thought maybe she'd been bitten by a spider or found something valuable, so i set the box down and rushed back to her. what i saw sent a chill down my spine. in the back room where she was, the back wall was lined with shelves, and there were clothing racks and boxes of clothes stacked in front of it. after moving the boxes, the shelves were in clear view. most were cluttered with knick knacks or such. but on the bottom shelf, centered and all alone there sat a familiar board-game sized cardboard box. we stared at it, then each other. neither of us said a word. we pulled it out and sure enough, it was the same damned box. the corners were torn. the sides were scratched. same one. i'd seen it thrown out twice before, yet here it was. we tried to tell my dad, but he isn't superstitious. my brother didn't believe us. they assume it's a separate game, and part of me wants to think so too. but i've seen that box too closely too many times. i know it's the same one. tl;dr - mom opens her own antique shop and we find a ouiji board and throw it out. then find it again and throw it out. then find it a third time and crap our pantaloons. edit: thanks for my first gold! as soon as mom and i decide what to do with the ouiji board, i'll update the post again"

3018	41514	396	bt3zc7	eou8gbo	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	k, so i live in this pretty suburban town in canada. however just about a kilometer behind us is a huge forest country that is completely backwoods and super creepy at night. anyway there was a party in this backwoods town one night so me and the boys decided to go. they left before i did and the guy i was supposed to leave with ended up crashing there. my mom didn't want me to stay the night so i called my sister and asked her to pick me up at the general store. so i left the house and it was about a 5km walk to the store. i got lost in the woods, and the shit i saw that night was absolutely terrifying. there was no noise in the world at all. not even my footsteps made noise. everything was dead silent. oh yeah and my phone was dead. but i'm not dumb, i knew the general store was east. so all i had to do was look for the north star. this is where i started freaking out. i looked up in the sky and there was no stars. nothing. this wasn't because of light pollution, it's a backwoods town at 2:00am. so i just kept walking, starting to freak the hell out. after walking through the woods for about an hour i came across a clearing but i stopped in my tracks when i saw a guy like 10ft in front of me. he was facing about 90 degrees away from me and there was something with his face and body that was just wrong. it was like he was incomprehensible to me. i got a huge chill down my spine and just a sense of dread like nothing i'd ever felt. keep in mind it was like 2:00am so there was no reason for this guy to be here. i didn't want to stick around for any longer so i turned right back and ran straight through the woods for as long as i could. eventually i reached a dirt road and collapsed, and by some stupid luck which i should not have been blessed with, i saw my sisters car pull up to me with a cop behind her. at this point it was like 4:00am and they were searching for me for like 3 hours. i got in the car and cried until i got home. i've never been back to that town, nor do i have any plans to go back. fuck. that.
3019	41514	550	bt3zc7	eoudhf6	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	a few years ago i went camping with my dad, my sister, my dad's friend, and my dad's friends dog. to get where we camped we had to boat across and down a river to where some old woods is. this was proper camping, not a campsite or anything. when we were there me and my sis decided to play hide and seek, i ran into the woods to find her, and about 30 seconds in i see this medium sized man, about 50 with long, ungroomed, grey hair just standing their. i saw him for about half a second because i was running and did a turn and only caught a glimpse. as soon as it happened my heart raced and felt deep inside my body. i turned back to see him and he wasn't there. i knew i really saw him because he was in a yellow rain coat that stood out abruptly in the woods. i called out hello a few times because i knew my dad could hear me, and if i got in a situation him, his friend, and his dog would run over if i screamed help. but he was just gone. i yelled at my sister to come back and she did straight away. i told everyone but no one believed me that he was there. well about 3am that night a police helicopter had flown right down above our camp at the clearing on the edge of the woods, they had a huge bright white light pointing on the camp and my dad and his friend went out to look. i don't remember what quite happened as i was tired, so i just lay there on my sleeping bag, a bit worried. i remember the helicopter left like 5 minutes later. the next morning we packed up and left. bloated down the river to the cars, and on my dad's friends car was a small card, like the size of a business card, but it was a light purple with a flowery background. it had a poem about death on it, and said rip at the bottom. a small amount of days later my dad's friend saw in the paper, a guy had went missing right where we went camping by the river, and must of been thought to of drowned of something right when we were camping, still no one believes me i saw the guy next to our camp.

3021	41514	5795	bt3zc7	eotxw2i	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was three, we were picking up my grandparents for a sunday drive. i was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side. my grandfather was sitting in front of me. suddenly he keeled over, dead of a massive stroke. as they hustled my little sister and me out of the car and into my grandparents' store, i happened to look over my shoulder and plainly saw grandpa walking down the street with two men. both were dressed in suits, which made it all the more incongruous that grandpa was wearing the same gray sweater and peaked hat he'd been wearing a moment before in the car. there was nothing particularly creepy about the experience, except that i wouldn't accept that grandpa was dead because, after all, i'd just seen him walking down the street. naturally, this didn't go over very well. but i loved my grandpa, i didn't want him to be dead- and i knew what i had seen! when our family doctor arrived to pronounce grandpa dead, my mother asked me if i would take his word for it. we had a very good, trusting relationship with our doctor, so i said that i would. the doctor assured me that my grandfather had in fact died. but he was the only grown up who didn't treat me like i was crazy. he listened respectfully as i told him what i had seen, and he suggested that maybe the men in the suits were angels. this seemed reasonable. problem solved. but to this day i can still see grandpa walking down the street with those two men. and no matter what my parents tried to tell me, it wasn't just a guy who looked like grandpa coincidentally wearing exactly the same clothes he'd been wearing in the car. it was him.
3022	41514	196	bt3zc7	eouabzt	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i once encountered what i can only think of to be a skinwalker. me and a friend were outside in a small town in germany, where my friend lived. it was past 11 pm on a summer evening, he would invite me for a sleepover on the 13th august every year, it always was pretty normal and we slept in a tent in his garden.this evening we decided to head to the towns playground to talk about stuff and do some stupid shit like doorbell-ditching. right behind the playground there was a small forrest in front of a big corn field. so after 20 minutes at the playground we hear a really loud scream, not anything human or anything that sounds like an animal, it came from the woods we turned around and saw something glowing brightly on the ground but it was a sphere and seemed almost liquid. we heard something running into the cornfield with fast big and light steps but suddenly the steps changed to a heavy slow trampling and something growled deeply. my friend and i tried to stay as quiet as posible not making a sound for the next 100 meters, then we ran off as fast as we could. i was paranoid the whole way back to his house and felt like someone was watching us. we instantly got in our tent when back at his home staying quiet and watching star-wars with headphones in one ear so that we could hear anything approaching (the ground was covered with leafs and you could hear everything that stepped onto it) our tent. we fell asleep at around 1 am. at 3 am i was woken to something walking in his backyard, i heard that it was bigger but very fast, i silently woke my friend up and we both listened to this creature walking around in his backyard. it suddenly stopped and we heard heavy thin breathing, like an old woman grasping for air. we were both extremely terrified. then again the creature started walking around but it's steps again turned heavy, like a bear or something, that's when all sounds seized for 15 seconds followed by light fast steps running away into the fields next to his house, and a high pitched screech. neither his nor my parents ever believed us. we visited the playground the next day to discover a few dead birds and a piece of wood still glimmering like a campfire that was left behind over the night, at the exact spot where the sphere was. edit: thank you guys for 125 upvotes!
3023	41514	6658	bt3zc7	eou224p	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ghost story time. i was living with a few of my friends a year and a half ago and were all pretty religious at least two of us work in religion. we were talking about how we didnt believe in ghosts or demons, at least in the sense that we couldnt see them if they were real. we started talking about how if we saw one it would change our perspective entirely. i said out loud, if something is here i wish it would just show us. two nights later im sound asleep and have the most vivid, brutal nightmare ive ever had. long story short i was in my childhood house, we were getting robbed, and the robber shot my father only it was me (i was the robber). my father and i had a very strained relationship and the detail of the shooting woke me up in tears. i mean i was sobbing. i looked at the foot of my bed and saw a man sitting on his heels staring at me. it looked like he was 80 years old but never hit puberty thats as best i can describe it. his face looked kind but his eyes looked so wicked it struck terror into my soul. he almost looked curious, but morbidly so. he was wearing clothes that looked like he was a newspaper salesman from 1890s new york. i only saw him for a split second and he was gone. the wild thing is i got all of that detail in just a split second, like he wanted me to remember him. heres the crazy part. so i was spooked to shit right? i went into our living room and watched youtube and some twitch streams for a bit until i convinced myself i was just half asleep and still spooked. i lay back in bed and the moment my head hits the pillow my room mate sits straight up in bed (still asleep), points at the foot of my bed and says, _______ (my name), who is that? i lost my god damn mind. i literally drove home at 3am and told my parents through tears i wanted to stay home until summer. i stayed at home for a week or so and then went back. my room mate started having night terrors after that but we moved soon after. ive never been so scared in all of my life. edit: ive had question about my room mates night terrors. the one i saw happened the first night i was back. basically were both sound asleep and he wakes up screaming. i dont mean yelling, i mean screaming. it sounded like an animal in pain, for those of you who have been hunting before he sounded like a dear screaming after being shot. i got down on the floor (he just slept on a mattress) and tried to calm him down but we locked eyes and he started to try to climb over me still screaming. he looked afraid, absolutely terrified. after two or three minutes he stopped all of the sudden, started mumbling and went back to sleep. i was holding his hands and our fingers were locked like when you wrestle and i had bruises the next day because of how hard he squeezed. the next morning i asked him if he remembers waking up screaming and he said, no but i had a crazy dream. you got down from your bed and started attacking me but you were covered in this black sludge. like your face was melting off but it was this tar-like goo that smelled like decay. after that two of my other room mates and i got together and prayed in our room. nothing quite as bad happened after that. some other less entertaining stuff happened like couches being stripped of their cushions and things spilling in the middle of the night. one time a bottle of wine just fucking exploded out of nowhere and scared us to death. thanks for the silver, was my first! edit #2: to be clear, im a seminary student and i work in ministry for high school students. not exactly a youth pastor, but sort of. i dont believe in spiritual healings or anything like that, im much more naturalistic about my beliefs but these things really happened, whether it was a hallucination or genuine spiritual thing i have no idea, i dont like to think about it.
3024	41514	93	bt3zc7	eou2szq	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 8 or 9, me and my brother were laying in bed ready to go to sleep. then all of a sudden our room is illuminated with a bunch of flashing lights. it was probably around 10 pm at the time and we were scared shitless. so the lights go on for a good minute and afterwards, we immediately look out the window to see what it was and we see nothing. no car, no random person playing a prank on us, nothing. so we run to our mom and tell her what happened and she doesn't believe us and just tells us to go to bed and stop making stuff up. to this day me and my brother vividly remember this, bit no one ever believes us.

"i was 8 and my brother was 10. it was sometime in the middle of the night when my brother went barging into my room saying, ""something is coming! something is coming!"". i went under my bed to hide and my brother went under the sheets on my bed. i laid there, and shit you not. door opens. and i see a pair of legs and feet that looked inhuman. idk how to describe it. it stood in front of my bed. then from there i dont remember what happened next. i went to sleep under my bed and my brother fell asleep on my bed. both me and my brother remember this still. (i'm 26 now and hes 28). unsure if it was our wild imagination or what. but for both of us to remember, makes me feel it may have happened."
3026	41514	253	bt3zc7	eougje6	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"my aunt emotionally abusing me when i moved to her with 16, because my dad was abusing me. it went from bad to worse in a week. and no one believed me what i was experiencing. she had a light bulb installed in my basement room. it had a cable going all the way up to her. whenever she wanted me to come up, she would blink the light and i have to run upstairs immediately. i couldn't finish my last task, like finishing the sentence i was just writing or wearing a shirt because i was about to get dressed. if i wouldn't be there 10 sec after the blink signal i would have consequences reaching from losing internet/my laptop for a few hours/days, or being force fed or having mandatory ""family time"", because i would need to learn respect. family time was me sitting in the living room, not allowed to move or do anything than sit and stare (not even reading a book or writing my diary), while uncle and aunt would belittle me and say hurtful things to me. the signal was happening up to every half hour. i am still sensitive to lights. i didn't want to eat meat for ethical reasons. i didn't make a big thing out of it. i just told her she wouldn't have to buy extra meat for me and i would be okay with the veggies. that's when she started to add bacon pieces and eggs into the veggies. when i had a different opinion than her or her fat loser husband, she would bend my arms so i couldn't move, hold a mirror inches away from my face and let me repeat to myself ""i am a liar. i am wrong. [aunt] is right and i'm a liar."" until she would be satisfied. different opinions would mean stuff like once i came home from school, they wanted to know what i learned today. i was telling them about my philosophy class, and started my sentence with ""so first we assume that humans, as all animals."". ""did you just call us animals? you have no respect! thou shalt not lie!"". this particular argument dragged until the evening. my door to my bedroom was broken, because she kicked it in. i asked her if we could repair it. the answer was no, because otherwise she couldn't just enter because i surely would lock it. the door was always a crack wide open. i asked to get a magnet, so at least it would click close. after a few weeks i got one. i am very skinny and she is very fat and old. i don't like to show my body around, so i like to wear tights when i wear skirts and t-shirt that go all up to my neck, so nobody could see my bones. she would think, that i was making fun of her and feel better than her for having a ""perfect body"". she would force me to strip down in the hallway, where windows were to the street, because i was body shaming her by covering mine up. i wasn't allowed to wear tights. she would make fun of me for wearing my skirts low, so they would cover more of my boney legs. once i was wearing a blouse and was about to leave for school. the blouse was wrinkled so she wanted to iron it real quick. she told me to take it off, so i wanted to go to my room and switch to a shirt until the blouse was ironed. i wasn't allowed to do that. i had to strip to my bra in the hallway (where all neighbors could've seen me). i was holding my hands up to my chest and tried to stand in a doorway, so i couldn't be seen. when she noticed that, she forced my hands down and let me stand in front of our glass door. because i did that for shaming her body, she said, and i shouldn't be so ignorant. she force fed me. i was eating very little, but i never was anorexic or anything. she would cook extra much and let me having to eat more than i could, until i felt like puking. i gained 10kg in a year. that was the time when i tried to be bulemic, but jokes on me, i can't puke. no matter how much i press back there or force my finger or toothbrush down, it doesn't work. i gag a lot, but nothing comes up. believe me, i tried. so i started to drink a lot of alcohol, because i would always puke from that. i ended up in the hospital twice for alcohol poisoning during my time at hers. i started self harm. not cutting. not my arms, because she would see. i would scratch my legs with my fingernails and/or scissors, until i had raw and fleshy wounds. then i would touch those wounds as often as i could with dirty hands so they would get infected and crusty from pus. i wanted to have maximum pain throughout the day. in the summer, it was smelly. during my time there i lost track of all my hobbies. before i read several books per week. i played guitar and piano. i had a very solidly kept diary. i learned a bit of programming myself. i drew so much. i really wanted to go to art school. being called up several times a day interrupted everything i loved. bit by bit i gave up everything and started to just sit on my laptop mindlessly all day, because i was just waiting for the next time it would blink. i ran away two times and lived among some punks in some occupied spaces, because it was better than living in constant fear. i stood behind her with a knife in my hand too often to count. i once lifted it and was seconds away from stabbing her ugly fat back, when she turned around. i told her i want to see a therapist. she didn't allow me that because ""we are not sick"". we, as in the family. because only sick weirdos go to therapists. she didn't allow me to have hobbies. aty parents place i was a good dancer. i was in a dancing group for 4 years and my whole life evolved around it. it was the only place i had friends. my aunt forbid me, because i had to focus on family first. if i would behave, i could join a dancing group. going behind her back didn't work, because she would track my school bus and control that i would be home on time. my school friends often hung out after school. i wasn't allowed to. my school friends would always hang out at this bar every friday. i lived in a village, so i asked my aunt and uncle to drive me there. they did it. i always asked them to drop me off a bit further down the road (like every teenager i guess). after a few weeks my uncle grabbed me by my shoulders, face to face inches away and whispered that he knew i was a looser who didn't have friends. he knew, that i was just just a poor ugly girl drinking alone on that park bench where he drops me off whole night. i moved out when i was 18. all the time i was telling my parents and teachers about what i experience at home. but no one believed me, because my aunt told them i was just a raging teenager. nobody believed me. i know this isn't even the worst what people experience. there are people who had it way worse. i never believed i was abused until my therapist told me it was definitely legit to call it like that. this was the two year of my life, that ripped me of all my joy that was left over from my dad's abuse, and noone believed me. i am very sure this will get buried, but it felt good to write it out."
3027	41514	1490	bt3zc7	eotxhfx	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was a kid, i used to stay at my grandparents house a lot. theyve had that house for as long as my mom has been alive, possibly even longer. all i know is that the history of the property is still unknown to this day. anyways, i used to stay in my moms old childhood roomit was called the purple room due to the purple carpet and the lavender wallpaper. it was a pretty big room with a queen sized bed in the middle, and a humongous window right next to it. during the summer i would frequently stay at that house and spend a lot of time in that room. one night, i vividly remember waking up late at night, probably 1 or 2 in the morning, and seeing a puppet show outside my window. i wish i was making this up. they were hand/sock puppets and it looked like it was only performed by one or two people. it was only a shadow of this performance, which threw me off, so of course i assumed i was still a little tired and totally out of it and imagining the whole thing. i decided to brush it off my shoulder and ignore it. oh man, do i regret that. as soon as i turned over on my right side, there in the doorway was a large black figure. it was pitch black out in the hallway, but i could clearly see a figure standing there. my stomach sank and my heart started beating quickly. i was wide awake now. i blinked a few times and i swear every time i did, it got a little bit closer. when it got arms length away from me, thats when i felt my heart stop beating completely and my body turning cold. i swear i could see my breath because of how cold it is. i was able to muster up a scream that woke up both of my grandparents and brother from their deep slumber. my grandma was the first one to come into my room, but as soon as she flicked the lights on, it was gone. never to be seen again. i was sobbing and trying to tell her what i saw, but she just kept stroking my hair and saying i was just having a bad dream. i know that wasnt a dream and what i saw was real. i also believe that this thing that i saw as a child has followed me when i moved to a different state. i was about 6 or 7 when this happened and im 16 now. to this day, no one believes me edit: if youre assuming its a mental illness of some sort; such as schizophrenia or anything else, ive already gotten myself checked on multiple occasions and i am perfectly sane and healthy. :) thanks for all of the concerns though!

""i'm from the energy company, you called and i'm coming to check it out."" as hes talking tge other guy gets out the car and we can hear him walking to the back door. my mom tells the guy she didnt call anyone, shes not letting him in. these guys were in street clothes.fyi. the other guy is now trying to force himself in the back door. the guy at the front window jumps on the ledge of the window and starts banging his arms and legs against the window in an attempt to break it. he starts yelling and calling her and i names. my mom grabs the phone and calls the police. now mind you, we will in the inner city on a busy street. people are driving by.and they arent stopping, not are the guys bothered by it. this is a high crime area. it is scary to feel like everyone can see and no one is going to help. as my mom is on the phone with 911, (the guys continue to be loud and yell at us and call names.) a station wagon pulls up in our next door neighbors driveway and sits there for a moment. the door opens and a tall, white man in a suit gets out. he makes eye contact with the guy on the ledge of the window and the would be intruder just stops banging. the pounding at the back of the house suddenly stops (my mom at this time is just hanging up with 911.who claims to be on the way). the men hold eye contact (and the intruder remains standing on the ledge). the tall white man walks to our neighbors house and starts to knock and ring the doorbell. after about 20 seconds of strange silence the man jumps off the ledge and the other guy is now standing by the car. they continue to stare at that guy and silently get in the car and drive away. after they drive away, the man at the neighbor's house comes to our front window.tells in asking my mom if shes ok. she says she is, and he says ""they're gone now, and they wont come back, you guys can stop crying."" he then walks back to his car and drives away.silently. the police arrive (about an hour later.typical to come that long after.since no guns were involved. ) my mom and i tell them everything. they then talk to all the neighbors. they question our next door neighbors; who heard a lot of the yelling, but couldn't see much from the way their windows face our house. but.they have no recollection of anyone coming to their house during this time. no one came in the driveway, no one knocked on the door and no one rang the doorbell. so of course, the police continued to question about this part of the story that was made up. talk about the chills; all my hair stood up when the neighbors claimed no one came over. i can still see that station wagon driving away. it seems like time stopped; the guy even waved as he left. but.i cant remember what he looked like at all. i have a great memory for faces.but his is just a white spot.weird. remains one if the scariest things memories i have; and we still talk about that guy. where did he go????? saved our lives."

3032	41514	2066	bt3zc7	eou293t	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	it was afternoon in the middle of summer. i was delivering soda to an old mental hospital that was in the process of being shut down. my call sheet didnt say which of the several buildings i should go to so i was trying doors on all of them until i got one that opened. the building that did open was the crappiest looking so far; it was missing bricks, and looked somehow just darker than the others. like it suddenly wasnt such a sunny summer day anymore. i was ready to get suddenly shanked by modern day sarah connor as i walked down this empty hallway trying to find.anyone who worked there. finally found someone and got their liquid diabetes order into their break room. by this time id been there an hour and really had to pee. i asked the lady if i could use theirs and she pointed me down the hall. there was one of those sudden wall and floor style changes right before the bathroom like you get in old buildings where an addition is made way later. the bathroom is on the old side, darker and colder than the side where the break room was. i really have to go though, and as a woman in a male dominated industry id peed in more awkward circumstances, so i walked in. its a one toilet deal and i locked the door behind me after finding the light switch, because there was no window. i sat and started the stream before realizing that it was a combo toilet shower room, with the shower recessed into the wall right in front of where i was sitting. all dirty institutional tile with an old, old school set of fucking chains and manacles for uncooperative patients bolted into the wall. it was the creepiest thing id ever seen. and as i peed and stared those fucking chains started swaying back and forth on the goddamn wall. yall, do your kegels because i cut off that stream while i was standing and pulling my pants up so fast i broke the sound barrier. the chains were still clanging around while i was struggling with the rusty old deadbolt on the door of that godforsaken, haunted-ass ancient lunatics bathroom. i ran down that hallway out to the truck fit to start crying, and i was not any kind of stranger to weird haunted things like that. it somehow scared me worse than growing up in a ghost-ridden house ever did. mental hospitals being decommissioned, never again.
3033	41514	5293	bt3zc7	eou3jxh	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"\*\*\*edit\*\*\* thanks everyone for reading my experience. as i figured, a lot of people wouldn't believe it (thus the theme of the thread.) little follow up to what all i can remember is that my dad instantly switched from working nights to working days so he could be home at night if anything else happened. a few months later my parents finally saved up enough money to move into a much better neighborhood. ever since i moved out of that area i never had any problems, other than the night terrors, since then.i will post a picture of the house below. mind you the surround houses drastically changed in appearance over the past like 20 odd years, but the old house still remotely looks the same. (its the puke green colored house) [https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8](https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8) only my mom ever believed me about this, unfortunately she is no longer alive so i cannot ask her for anymore details than what i have been told while growing up. my dad just never wants to talk about what happened. i used to live in this rented house near an appliance store from birth up until i was six years old. i am 24 now and out of the military, if that tells you how long ago this was. since it was a small house and i was the younger sibling, and my dad worked nights, i ended up sleeping in my parents room until we moved out. it should be noted that one side of my bed was against a wall, and the other facing the doorway. i remember having this cookie monster plush that i was obsessed with and would never go to sleep without it. if my mom ever tucked me in without it i would throw a tantrum until i had my best friend. things started to change when i was about to turn four though. my mom would wake up and notice i would be sleeping without the plush and that it would be under my bed. not thinking much of it, she would just put it back in my bed and let me continue sleeping. this kept going on for a couple of weeks until my mom finally decided to ask me about why cookie monster would always be under my bed when she would wake up. i remember saying something along the lines of ""he is my friend, he talks to me and likes to walk around at night."" or something of that matter. from my perspective, i knew i was talking to cookie monster because i could see his eyes. you know how he has those big white eyes that stick out. he would talk to me at night and help me go back to sleep when i was scared. my mom played it off as my overactive child's imagination, but it slowly was about to get worse.over the course of the next couple of months i would have night terrors. no, not simple nightmares. i am talking about full blown night terrors, so bad to the point i would stiffen up and do nothing but scream as my mom tried to rock me back to sleep. this went on for almost every single night.they were so scarring on younger me that to this day i remember what they were about. i would be laying in bed at night when my cookie monster plush would came to life, drag me out of my bed, and pull me under it to eat me. shit, i never stopped getting these dreams until i was 14 that is how scarring they were. about a year from moving out of the house and into a better place, my mom would learn the truth behind the whole ordeal. she woke up to some noises one night and heard me out in the living room talking to cookie monster. now you might expecting that i am going to say she saw me talking to the plush, but you are wrong. you might expect me to say that i was laying in my bed and only the plush was out in the other room, but you are wrong. but reality is much, much scarier than any fictional story. what she saw instead, is much worse than any paranormal activity shit you could ever see in any move theater, for instead of a possessed doll, she saw me standing there, talking to the dark.my mom instinctively turned on the light and as soon as she did, two old guys went running out of the now wide open front door.the only thing i remember from that night was my mom holding onto me for dear life as my dad and the police rushed to the house.the thing that scares me to this day is not the fact that i was talking to two random strangers that night. what scares me to this day, is that i was talking to these people for months without knowing it. i was talking to the people who were constantly breaking into my house every night. that they were breaking in for months without kidnapping me, or stealing anything from us. what scares me to this day is that i still have no idea what they ever planned to do."
3034	41514	1942	bt3zc7	eotvuqe	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was 9 i was home alone at like 10 pm and this white van just pulls up on my driveway. the van had tinted windows as well as being in the dark so i couldnt see the driver. i was shitting myself because i thought a pedo was gonna come and kidnap. it just sat there for like 20 minutes and drove off. to this day no one believes me.
3035	41514	1718	bt3zc7	eou7fkr	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not sure if it counts but quite creepy, since it's not that people don't believe me, but the second part isn't quite creepy to them as it actually is. here it goes: there's this abandoned resort place like a 15 minute walk away from my house. the place is old, cieling fell in some places. one day, me and a friend were exploring and found some papers, one of them was a list of people that died while building the place, sizeable list, maybe 10-15 people. a few weeks ago, me and that same friend were there at night for some night pics. when we approached the place, it was nothing unusual. but later a bit we heard stuff fall and break inside, (keep in mind, if anything was there, it would have escaped a while ago. since we were blasting some music to negate the creepiness there. also there are no wild animals around the place, like never, and it is in a rural area, and it's not possible to even meet a homeless person around these parts, let alone one sleeping there) as we're taking this long exposure milky way pic with the resort in frame, we heard some glass break, even though there is just about no glass left to break here. we felt some extremley strong creepy feeling and legged it outta there as soon as we took the pic. i'll link the pic shortly. edit: here it is: https://i.redd.it/nwemklqe54q21.jpg edit2: forgot to say i had some very wierd time sleeping that night
3036	41514	75	bt3zc7	eou9uuu	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	maybe less creepy and more of just flat out weird, but one christmas morning many years ago my friend and i decided to meet up at a park just to hang out. now this park has a clear view of a very major highway and unsurprisingly it was empty. maybe one or two cars every 7 minutes or so. however, at one point cars just stopped coming entirely for like a 30 minute period and out of the blue a horse drawn carriage makes its way down the highway. my friend and i kind of look at each other to confirm that we were both seeing it, and yes it was real. mind you this is socal so this isn't a common occurrence at all, but we brushed it off as maybe a quince celebration or something, so we get up and start walking back to my house. suddenly we look up and a parachuter is dropping down a decent distance away. no plane in sight, and no logical landing location. we both stare at him for a while before continuing to walk, a few seconds later we both look back to see how our man up there is doing and he's gone. we confirm with each other that yes we both saw him and yes he seemed to have disappeared. as we walk, puzzled, a car drives by. no problem there, we were in a neighborhood at that point. however, he turns a corner and just pure silence. we were maybe 10 feet from that corner so logically we should have at least heard it go into the distance, but we didn't. it turned the corner and just was gone. we ran to see it, and there was no trace. i'm pretty sure we were in some sort of alternate reality there.
3037	41514	836	bt3zc7	eotxjl1	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i used to do this as a kid, but id hallucinate stuff like shadows arguing or corner of my eye people. i know the things i see arent real and cant hurt me, but it still doesnt change the fact that im terrified shitless of them. the scariest one was reoccurring. its more recent and im chalking up its creation to me being stressed out. it would perch on my table and watch me from across my bedroom. its always dark but i know that if i can see it, it can see me. when id say something about it, everyone would laugh and say that i was nuts/i was cursed. i havent seen it in a few months and idk if itll come back. edit: today i learned, i might have a brain tumor or (more popularly) schizophrenia. guys, i really appreciate your advice. i just dont want to have an evaluation only to get a whole bunch of mental illnesses stamped on my forehead. edit #2: im aware of the things that might be wrong with me. thank you for your insight and most of you have been helpful. i am looking into what i should do in terms of getting this whole thing figured out.
3038	41514	325	bt3zc7	eotyzlp	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i remember when i was little and was taking a bath with the help with my mom. some guests came over so she left me alone for a bit to talk to them leaving me. personally i was always scared of being alone in the bathroom - maybe because of bloody mary or being a pussy. anyways, i remember looking at the mirror and swear to god seeing a women in their with black hair, white skin, staring at me. its very cliche, black hair, pale skin, looking at me in the mirror. it could be my imagination but this isnt the first time ive seen crazy shit update : just had a fucking nightmare
3039	41514	72	bt3zc7	eouo17n	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i went to a non-religious highschool in the uk. i was always a nerdy kid who the teachers liked so often got given tasks like delivering papers to other teachers or to bring sick kids to the nurse. basically little jobs which meant i was walking around the school occasionally outside of class times. for about a month or so i kept seeing this nun walking around the school when nobody else was around. i'd get back to class and tell my mates but they all thought i was taking the piss. i asked a few of the teachers and they just openly laughed at me saying we don't have nuns at the school. it became a massive running joke with a lot of people in my class that i kept seeing nuns that weren't there. i even saw the bloody nun when i was with my friends once and pointed her out and the walked around the corner. my friend just missed her and we couldn't find her after running after the nun. one girl later said she also saw the nun but still people didn't believe me. over 10 years on i'm still bitter. fuck that nun

"so, my best friend believes me, but no one else. my boyfriend was staying the night with us (theres me and 3 other roommates, one being my best friend). he and i went to bed around 3 am because he had to leave early, and i had work at 4 pm. i tried to sleep, even took melatonin. every time i would almost get to sleep, my body would tense and i'd gasp and panic. i kept having minor panic attacks. i wasn't stressed or anything. i took antistress gummies just in case. it worked a little bit but i still kept tensing and gasping. finally, i felt myself drift asleep. my eyes were partially open and i could see this girl. it didn't freak me out. i do believe in the paranormal but i'm also skeptical. i debunk stuff like that all the time. she was about 8ish years old, african american with short pigtail braids. her mouth didn't move but i could hear her talk, ""this is how i sleep."" she was holding a small blanket or something, ""i put the blanket this way on my legs and i move so my body is like this"" she shifted like she was laying down but she was still vertical. my body automatically moved the way she did. i didn't realize it until right before i fell asleep. i passed out and didn't wake up once. i told my boyfriend and he swears i was dreaming but i remember what my tv was playing and the way he was sleeping. i wasn't dreaming. sorry for how long that was lol"
3041	41514	595	bt3zc7	eoucyvv	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	finally- my chance to shine! so, i live in edinburgh in scotland which has, naturally, rather a lot of old buildings. when i was four my family moved into a victorian villa that was built in 1860. lovely place, beautiful big garden - happy days! that was, until what i like to refer to as the incident of the window. so, one afternoon small me was sat under the window in the ground floor living room playing with some barbis. mum is in another room, and no one else is in. no-one else should be outside either, may i point out! but lo and behold, i look up to notice someone walking along the front of the house toward the window i am sat under. panic ensues at this point, but its hard to describe. while i was definitely a shy child, i wasnt terrified of general people in the public sphere. all i can remember is this really strong feeling of wrongness, so i dipped behind the armchair that faced away from the direction the gentleman was walking and hid. after a bit i peek around the side of the chair to see if its safe to come out yet, and see a man passing the window. he lifts his hat at me and smiles, then continues on his way. i howl for my mum! after a mad dash through to the sitting room, and my garbled explanation of the problem, she goes outside to obviously find nobody there. she checks our wash house, the summer house and the garage but they are all free of middle aged men in jaunty hats. she assumes someone has come down the drive, which is long and cuts around the side of the building with a separate entrance, assuming it was a short cut off the street and left when they realised their mistake. adult me finds this story pretty implausible but heyho, we say what we need to to placate kids eh?! and in the past a couple of people had made that mistake, only they realised and turned back / apologised long before reaching the far windows! anyway, i am assured its nothing to worry about and go back to days whiling away the merry childhood hours doing random crap in this room by that window. however!! later in that same week the *same man* appears again! (how bad aaare his directions, you might well ask). this time mum and i are alone again, but with the important difference she is doing the dishes in the kitchen next door and is stood in front of the window: looking out. she has seen nobody go past, but at my shout of that funny looking man is back! she bolts out the door in a flash - to find absolutely no-one there. a fact she already expects because she has seen nobody go past the entire time she has been in the kitchen. again, she checks all the out buildings - and finds nothing. once again she attempts to reassure me that it is probably nothing to worry about; that it probably wasnt the same man and that they will put something on the drive to make clear it isnt a passage for the public. i insist doggedly to anyone who will listen that this was the same man, and that he looked funny. eventually my grandma, who is a big believer in the supernatural, came to stay with us and the whole incident is brought up. by this point i no longer willingly go anywhere near windows on that side of the house and live in general terror of people looking in at me. she asks me to describe who i saw. at this point i feel i should mention how utterly obsessed with the victorian period i was for my entire childhood. i was forever playing olden days set then, i had loads of dressing up clothes of it, and collected lots of childrens tv or books set in, or about, the period. you can probably see where this is going, but i described a victorian mans get up, which my grandma recognised instantly. she said she thought it was the old gardener by the style of dress i explained, down to the hat, and that she thought it was just his way of letting us know he was happy a new family had come to live there. her and my mum thought that was a lovely heart warming tale, but i have spent the rest of my life terrified of it - meanwhile anyone else who ever heard the story either believes the same man stupidly walked down that drive by mistake twice in one week, or that i fell asleep and dreamt it. twice in one week tho? ** edit: just clarifying, i realise people do have recurring dreams. its the notion of me falling asleep, while sat on the floor next to a table playing with toys, twice at a random time of day in a week that i would say is unlikely to me! also, not saying it was def a ghost. it was just really weird / unsettling!

"for about a year i would get these phone calls, always at the same time (2 or 3 am), and the caller never spoke. just. breathing. then the time changed and the calls were coming at about 11 am. then the calls stopped for about a year. they started coming in again. again, regularly around the same time of day 2 or 3 times a week. i started having fun with it. i would answer and say ""hey buddy haven't heard from you in a while! i've really missed our little chats."" then i started collecting cat facts to recite to them. or i would discuss current events. i think the longest i was able to keep them on the line was about a minute and a half. ended up getting a new phone number but i wonder about my harmless stalker sometimes. hope you're doing well, weirdo. not super creepy but that's all i got."

"before starting this story, keep in mind that i was around 9 years old, so certain details are lost to me. but the story is still the same. &#x200b; &#x200b; around 2010, i lived in a two story apartment. and was in the 4th grade at the time. living with my older brother and my two parents. due to my brother being the oldest child in house, he had his own space. he just djayed all day and all night long, mixing music and having a good time. making ""fire"", basically. he also had a medium sized disco-ball that filled his room with colorful lights when it was night, and turned it on each time he was still djaying late into the night. one day, i was walking in the hallway upstairs when he called my name, wanting to show me something. which turned out to be a video he recorded on his phone. he proceeded to tell me that he left it on his bed and forgot about it. because of this, it lead to his phone recording for 10 minutes and some number of seconds. he then told me that there was something weird about the video, and that he wanted me to see it. i said okay, and he played it. for the first two minutes, you just heard mexican music and dub-step in the background. as he was trying to composite those two music genres together. and his room was completely dark minus for the disco ball i mentioned rotating random colors everywhere, making seeing his room difficult. another two minutes in and stuff started to get strange. you see, in the video, the music got quieter. and at some point, it stopped. so it was just quietness for a couple moments. i remembered being a little unnerved by this. then late into the video, he asked if i saw it. i said *saw what*. he then backed tracked, and pointed to a mask he had sitting on top of his tower computer. something that i completely overlooked when watching his video. then he said to watch it. i saw this mask-head thing go up and down very, very slowly. he even scrolled back and forth in the progress bar and made sure that i saw it. since i was a kid and all. i was really freaked out by it. i then proceeded to ask if his fucking with me, he said no and that he's not shitting. i believed his answer because he didn't crack a smile and didn't show any signs that he was lying, but i did know that he is a bit of a liar sometimes. the weird thing that i think about now recalling this memory is that i never actually this mask in his room when i walked into his room and showed me this video. i know that this could've been easily faked, but it still unnerved me by how weird it was. and how serious his face was. only me and him knew this happened, my parents don't know. but i don't think it matters &#x200b; anyway, that's all."

3046	41514	551	bt3zc7	eotwp02	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was a wee child, when i was still put down for naps, every day a shadow man would pop out from the end of the bed as soon as my mom left the room. it would pop up and do a little hop before just standing there, as if it was waiting for me. it had no face, or any other discernible features other than the general body structure of a man, with it's entire being simply a flat, opaque brown-grey shadow. despite this, it would stare at me. each and every day, for the duration of my nap. when it started i would call frantically for my mom, but she would never come to save me. as time went on, however, i grew used to the shadows presence, though never comfortable with it. i never did fall asleep with it there. it never harmed me, or even acknowledged me beyond the staring. it would, however, occasionally wave, as if saying goodbye to something on the other side of the bed. occasionally there would be 2. sometimes both on the same side, and sometimes on opposite sides. they were practically the same, *different* at the same time. they never acknowledged each other, just *me*, though when they were on opposite sides they would stare at each other in addition to me. as i grew out of naps i stopped seeing him/them. i still live in the same house though and i know they are still there. as i've posted this story in the past redditors have suggested everything from faes to sleep paralysis. all i know is i saw something and it's fucking terrifying.
3047	41514	125	bt3zc7	eou186o	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	back in 1999 when i was twelve, i saw an explosive light in the night sky. i was in a grocery store parking lot, and i didn't even think to look up until i noticed other people pausing in the lot and gazing upward. it looked like a flower of fire, spreading out slowly and burning bright. from our view, it was twice the size of the moon at its maximum spread. it then began to fade, but it was an eerie kind of fade-out that didn't register until it was completely gone. it could have been any sort of natural space phenomena, a rare spectacle of our galaxy bent on relativity and such with nothing to do with ufos or ball lighting or whatever. every time i tell people, though, they just smirk and shake their heads at me, even though there are crazier stories out there with less/no witnesses.
3048	41514	129	bt3zc7	eoufbhe	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i was 7 years old, walking home from a friend's place late on a summer night. i walked past a parked vw beetle, as i noticed a man sitting in the driver's seat, staring at me. he had long, thin hair and a tie-dyed bandana around his head. he smiled widely, and lifted his hand to make the peace sign. as i looked closer i noticed his skin was rotting away, like he'd been dead for months. at this point i started running home.
3049	41514	175	bt3zc7	eou2gw7	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	so yeah, got a couple. over the course of maybe two weeks in a new house my family got a lot of paranormal activity. first was my older brother who saw a middle aged man fron the 60s looking outside the window , just floating in the living room, no legs. my mother often heard a very young girl run all the way across the corridor at night, and converse with my very young brother (also, when she appeared, the trap used for going into the attic (which is realllllly heavy) was completely opened). i saw a shadowy figure climb the stairs with me one day, but it wasn't mine since i eventually stopped, but the shadow climbed two more stair before turning his shoulders towards me as if he was saying : the hell you waiting for? i also heard a big scary mean voice kinda scream something completely intelligible in my ears, and thats it. felt in danger for like 6 hours straight, wasn't fun. we eventually found out that the first man in the living room was the deceased cousin of my grandma (motorcycle accident) thanks to a photo of him that my brother recognised immediatly. everything stopped after 2-3 weeks strangely enough.

"ah, well. first off sorry for formatting, mobile user. there's this old house where some family members worked, it's called 'east riddlesden hall.' it's been there for yonks and it's known to have weird/paranormal phenomena go on inside, these are a couple of stories from my family that worked there. story one: my great uncle was going around the house looking for anyone still inside before it shut (it's a museum so people are allowed inside, providing no touchy) and all other staff except the receptionist had gone home and he'd noticed a particularly strong smell of toffee/caramel cooking. this smell had originate from the kitchen, with nobody inside , it's out of use anyway so he goes and asks the receptionist about it and she stands up and follows him to the kitchen, she says she can smell bacon cooking. they make sure nobody's left a weird smelling air freshener or something and locked up, assuredly a little bit creeped out. story deux: my sister had been working there a couple of weeks and was using one of those light detector machines (like the ones they use on ghostbusters, but for light levels, i can't remember the exact name of it) and closing the blinds to make sure nothing gets damaged from light exposure, when one of her colleagues walks in and they start chatting. they were facing each other so my sister could a see a door behind her partner and while they were talking, saw a flash of light followed by a woman in a dress walk past. she asked around and was eventually told that that figure was the lady of the house who was killed by her husband for reasons that aren't important, it was in her room which is known as ""the grey lady's chamber"" for fairly obvious reasons. if any of you are skeptical, please. go and look this up, it's really interesting."

"about 15 years ago, my wife and i separated when my two youngest were 2 and 4 years old. she went to live with her mom, leaving the children with me. the two youngest shared a room. they had a hard time with their mom leaving and i had to deal with some behavioral issues and night-time complaints. also, both their mom and nana would show up at random times to ""spend time"" but really just to chew me out about some thing or another. one morning, about 4 or 5 am, they both came crying into my room saying that nana visited them and talked to them. once i got them calmed down and asleep, in my bed, i called their mom. i was livid. showing up at random times during the day was one thing, showing up at 4 am was beyond the pale. she answered in tears and said, ""i can't talk right now, mom died in her sleep last night."" and hung up. i have no idea how long i sat there, until i went back to bed and cuddled with my two youngest children. they have since grown up, time being what it is, and have forgotten all about it. one has decided they are an atheist and doesn't believe in supernatural anything, to the point where they won't even watch shows where supernatural events are portrayed. the other has become a nihilist who believes supernatural things may be possible, but ghosts don't exist because when we die we just . evaporate. no one else was there. no one, not even the two most involved, believes that this happened."
3053	41514	62	bt3zc7	eoupwa0	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i'm probably really late but this is the perfect chance to share my story. let me preface it by saying my dog is nine years old now. in those nine years she was only ever aggresive one single time. that was when she was four years old. about five years ago, it was around 8 pm and my friend is over and we are making food and getting ready to watch a movie. all the blinds are open to the back porch and the light is on shinning in the backyard. my dog is sleeping by the front door which is on the entire other side of the house. we sit down with our food and turn on the show, not even two minutes in and both of us out of the corner of our eyes see a very tall almost human like creature scurry/run across the back yard. both of us felt completely paralyzed and couldn't move. the light in the back then goes out, and in that brief moment my dog comes running at light speed to the back porch door snarling with all her teeth out. that entire night she refused to move from the back porch door and just sat there showing her teeth. my friend and i have never experienced anything like it and to this day we both get chills talking about it. the light from the back porch never worked again after that night. ive tried googling what it was we saw and neither of us ever came up with a good explanation, but there is no way it was human.
3054	41514	63	bt3zc7	eourfkm	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i've posted this elsewhere. back in the 70's (yes i'm old) i was hitchhiking. one ride dropped me off but i still had about 20 miles to home. it was one of those dark roads, no lights or houses, just corn fields on either side. i began to walk but there wasn't any traffic. i can hear the echo of my footsteps, i thought. i stopped and heard something walking inside the corn. then it stopped. i began to walk. it walked. i ran. it ran. i quickly did a 180. i heard it stop, turn and begin to run, then suddenly stopped. as soon as it got beside me it stopped. i ran again and did a 180. it ran, then did the 180. i could see the top of the corn moving. i saw headlights coming and stepped into the middle of the road and was waving my arms and they stopped. i jumped in. that haunts me to this day. i could tell it was a bi-ped. i did live in an area that had bigfoot sightings, and an insane asylum. so my mind was racing. i've never been that scared again.
3055	41514	1005	bt3zc7	eotqapc	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	let me preface this by saying i played a lot of crash team racing as a younger child. one night when i was about four or so years old i wasn't having the best sleep. so i woke up in the middle of the night and to this day, 12 years later, i swear i had an auditory+visual hallucination of aku aku (the tiki guy) incoherently speaking. little four year old me almost shat his pants and ran over to his parents room. looking back on it i am pretty sure they just played it off as a dream but i know what i saw. (still play crash team racing though. cannot wait for the remaster to come out.)
3056	41514	58	bt3zc7	eoumytb	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"i'm posting from my mum's perspective as i never personally saw what she saw, but i was the only one who believed her. a couple of years ago my mum ran a hugely successful cleaning business in england, and based on her location most of her clients were based in the countryside in huge houses ( biggest house she had to clean was a mansion with over 100 rooms to give you an idea of the scale of these houses) anyway, one of the houses she cleaned was a huge bed and breakfast that was converted into a huge house. this house is estimated to have been built sometime in the 1700's ( not that uncommon in the english countryside) the family there consisted of a husband, wife and 3 kids between the ages of 3-5. a very important detail is that one of their kids died at teenager age, maybe 14 based on pictures (mum never asked how, she felt too disrespectful to ask) the husband was a bit strange, anti social, career focused. he was mostly at work so mum and i didn't see him often. the wife was maybe mid 20's, very chatty and friendly and she loved her kids. the fact they were such a normal family makes the events of this story worse. so, mum was asked to clean the 3 floors of the house. however, the wife told mum that on the 3rd floor is where the guest rooms are and they collect a lot of cobwebs. (old house, completely normal) and so they only need cleaning once a month. this is where things get weird. she was given strict instructions not to enter the room 3rd along the hallway on the 3rd floor. that was their dead sons room and they want it left completely alone. okay, sure. the first time she did the new cleaning job at this house, she came home early in absolute hysterics. now, this is a woman who was a carer for years, she's held many dead bodies and guts in her time. so not a lot affects this woman, she's a tough mum. i've never seen anything affect her like this day she came home. she said as soon as she climbed those stairs to the 3rd floor, everything went quiet and freezing cold. chalking it up to old creepy house, she pressed on. she opened up the door to the hallway that leads to the 6 guest rooms. upon walking in, the 3rd and 4th door opens inwards and she hears a young child giggling, and a child on a tricycle comes out the 3rd door and wheels round to the 4th. my mum dropped the hoover and ran the fuck out of there. she asked her other employee to come up with her. they didn't see the boy again, but the atmosphere was still there. they peeked into the 3rd room (my mum has huge balls and morbid curiosity that overrides her fear) and she said it looked like a murder scene. there was dried brown blood on what looked like a normal kids room, on the covers of the bed, the carpet etc but she said the worse part was turning to the wall and seeing ""help me"" scrawn into the wall in fresher blood than the rest. mum and employee got the fuck out of there. they immediately went downstairs to the wife, and just as she was about to say "" i'm not cleaning the 3rd floor at all, you need to find someone else."" the wife looked to her and said "" i can tell you went up to the 3rd floor, i understand you don't want to clean up there, none of the cleaning companies we've hired will go up there. we usually do it ourself. "" upon hearing this story from mum i was thinking hoooly shit. i dont understand how this family uses those rooms as guest rooms! as in, friends and family stay in those rooms over christmas etc. a few months later, she was scheduled to do that house alone, she practically begged me to come along. now it's not uncommon i helped out at the time because i loved her and supported her business but in all honesty i was shit scared. she even had to offer me payment before i considered. so upon arriving i immediately hate this house. huge long driveway, massive courtyard in front of the house. old rotting wood supports, all windows facing outwards towards the courtyard where we park the van. i can see those 3rd floor windows and i am extremely nauseous. the 3rd floor windows are completely black, but my mum was certain they didn't have curtains. oookay. so, i start cleaning, and the first thing i noticed is that there are hidden cameras everywhere. i mean, fucking everywhere. maybe mum didn't spot them because she doesnt know what's she's looking for ( she's a bit old bless her) but i could see little glowing lights where they were on and recording, they were very well hidden mind you, i can't be certain i found all of them but in the whole house i counted 130 cameras. 130. one hundred, and fucking thirty cameras have been recording mum and all her employees ( including me) for months. what the fuck. upon this discovery, i immediately told mum and she went apeshit at the wife, who was the only person present. mum hated being filmed while doing her job, and it's not uncommon people record cleaners to make sure they don't steal, but not 130 fucking cameras. this is where the story gets worse than that creepy upstairs. the wife had no fucking clue what we were on about. what the fuck. we went around the house and i pointed them all out for mum and the wife. the wife was gobsmacked at this. we had to leave for the day as we had finished, and the wife said she'd have words with her husband when he got home. so. the next week i come with mum again and as soon as we greet the wife we know something is very wrong today. the wife is teary eyed and has a weak voice. she asks us to sit down in the kitchen for a talk. she says she confronted the husband and found out a lot of things. firstly, all these cameras went to a random, locked room where the husband had a mini cctv setup where he held all the footage, and he was forced to show the wife what recordings were stored. ooh boy. there were thousands of trimmed videos of my mum cleaning, bending over, working and were extremely perverted, not only that, but he saved recordings of his own kids undressed in their rooms. oh my god i felt so sick hearing this. she said she was going to the police when he goes away on a trip to avoid more confrontation because she was scared, she was also packing up her and the kids stuff to move to her mums house. she begged my mum not to ever come near the house again and she will pay her to keep this quiet. ( i guess they had a reputation in the area and didnt want word going around? not sure how you can keep that shit safe??) to this day, mum and i have never said a word about what that wife said to us. she said she wont accept any money for bribery, and she will never be in contact again, and that was that. we went in the van, went home and had lunch. we both didn't want to speak and felt so sick. we still haven't spoken about it in full. bonus, we drove past that hellhole house about 2 years afterwards and we saw a new family playing in the gardens outside the front. myself, mum and that employee are the only people who know what we saw. mum tried telling the story of the room to the rest of the employees and they laughed as if it was a ghost story. she never mentioned that weird fucking husband. sadly, these things are much more scary when it's for real. fuck. tl;dr creepy house with a young family, their child died and they kept his room as it was which was covered in blood, saw the boy riding a tricycle upstairs. even worse, the husband had cameras planted around the house and had recordings of my mum cleaning and his own children undressing. we got the fuck out of there and never saw them again, new family moved in and house is back to normal. (ish)"

"when i was about 3 i kicked my ball into my neighbors house. nobody was living there at the time and the front door was open, i kicked the ball further into the house for no reason and it went into a room. i remember hearing a voice and then seeing the voice coming from what looked like a gas cloud in the room staying still. no idea what i saw but my brothers remember me trying to show them the ""gasman"""
3059	41514	56	bt3zc7	eou7lwv	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was four i fell asleep on the couch next to my mom. i woke up later in the night and the television was static and silent and lit up the dark room. i saw a woman walk out of the basement and into the kitchen. she turned to me with her finger to her lips to tell me to be quiet. she slowly walked to the other side of the room, motioning me to follow her. when she turned the corner where i could not see her, i woke up mom who told me i had a bad dream. this has always stuck with me and it happened in the 70s.
3060	41514	49	bt3zc7	eoun8yz	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 12, i was in a living room with a bunch of family members. people talking, music playing, even the front door was open so you could feel the air flow and hear the noises outside. all of a sudden everything went still and quiet, like time itself froze for everything but me. it took a second or two before i clued in that something was wrong, and i could see people around me looking exactly as they did, even with my grandpa in the middle of a story with his mouth wide open. i walked a few steps forward to try and figure out what was happening and really to just see if i even could move, and then like a switch it all started back up again. absolutely no one believed me and i don't blame them. to this day i've only told maybe three or four people in real life and i've lived a long time since then.
3061	41514	52	bt3zc7	eoupusg	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this is going to get lost, but here it goes. i was probably about 7 or 8 years old. my room was at the end of the hallway with the stairs to the attic right outside my door. the way my bed was positioned, i could see the bottom of the stairs and clear down the hallway. well one night i flip over, and i see the legs of a woman sitting on the stairs. she wore a long dress and dress shoes. i covered my head with the blankets until i ended up falling asleep. a few years later, i'm playing spiderman 2 in the guest room on my gamecube. i saw the shadow of a woman in a dress and a veil walking along the wall. just as it disappeared, some toys from the toy box fell over. there was nothing that should have made a shadow like that. there was only one window, but it had a garbage bag over it because my dad slept there when he worked overnight (the bag blocked out the light). after i graduated high school, i moved out to indiana (this all occured in pennsylvania). i met my wife there and we have a daughter. well last thanksgiving, we came to visit my parents for the holiday. we slept in the guest room, and after the first night, my wife said she got a bit creeped out last night. when i asked why, she told me she woke up and thought she saw a black figure standing over me, but it disappeared after a few seconds. remembering my childhood, i asked her what it looked like. she described exactly what i had seen as a child. a woman in an old long dress and a veil. i had never told my wife about the woman i saw growing up because i brushed it off as the imagination of a child. now i'm not so sure.
3062	41514	335	bt3zc7	eoubyf4	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this happened to me when i was about 14 years old. i and my friend were really into photography at the time and we woke up early to shoot empty streets in the morning sun. we were walking on a small street filled with family houses, nobody was around except us and that blue-soft morning light was giving a pretty dreamy look to everything. (i can't give a more accurate description in english sry) anyway. we came around one corner and we could clearly see one of the houses on fire. whole house burning down at once. we have both seen it. we both felt the heat, heard the terrifying sound of a giant fire. we panicked and called the firefighters. gave them coordinations of the house and everything. but as i said, we were 14 and really scared so we both gave up on waiting for the firefighters thinking that staying near the house would just bring us trouble and we ran away in panic. next day we came back to see how did the fire damaged the house and guess fucking what. everything was normal. no sights of fire or damage. we were discussing what could possibly cause that for like 15+ minutes until we have decided to knock on the door. middle-aged women opened them and got pretty pissed when we told her about the fire. she thought we were just teens trying to be funny. later we got into huge trouble for bothering the fire brigade. to this day we are both sure we saw that exact house on fire. but officially that house never burned or any different house in that area.
3063	41514	441	bt3zc7	eou4i5b	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	it's neither my scariest nor creepiest i've seen and since i've two friends who saw the same thing, i certainly have someone who believes me but it still is my most prominent thing i remembered in my first year at the middle school till these days. it maybe past five and school's over so does my playing around behind the home economies building. with my two friend who heading home in the same direction as mine, we simply walk across the all-purpose field, which have a huge flag pole in the middle, to the school gate. while doing that, i don't know why, maybe because of the flag or something caught my eyes, but i looked up and on top of that pole sat a man. he looked elderly small, dirty, clothes and all, and have darker skin than most i've seen in that day. at first, he look ahead but suddenly turn his head and lock his glares at me. as soon as i saw that i just picking up my speed and almost got up to sprint at the time i make it out of the school gate. and like all protagonist in the horror films, the young me have to glance back to check only to made an eyes contact with him. after that i ran till out of breath and then realized that, strangely enough, my two friend were ahead of me all those time, sprinting and all. turn out, they also saw the exact same thing but too scare to tell me. but that is the first and last time i ever saw him. as a citizen of a mostly superstitious country, he is some kind of the school guardians, watching and making sure that the kids got out of the school safely, or so it seems.
3064	41514	261	bt3zc7	eou7fc5	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i saw a non native poison snake in the forest of my old neighborhood, behind a house.it had eggs and it looked at me. i was afraid and ran as fast as my 6 year old legs could take me, told my brother who didn't believe me.the woods where i saw the snake are gone. i have never told this story to anyone besides my brother and feel stupid writing it now. edit: this was in oregon and this is the only snake that isn't a garden snake i have ever seen.
3065	41514	476	bt3zc7	eou1jz8	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	two years ago, i moved out into rural indiana with some of my best friends to share a pretty large apartment that was above my best buddys dads garage. since most of my family is from the area, most of them have known about the house their whole life and all of them pretty much unanimously agreed that it was haunted. before my friends dad moved in, the place had actually been a church. one wing was the actual chapel and the other was living quarters. my mom said multiple exorcisms had been done there and she once watched the double doors to the living quarters fly open and something stomped down some stairs, all during an exorcism. hell, even when i got there, my other friend i was living with showed me the unused concrete basement and in there was a room that seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, bigger than a closet but smaller than a typical room. the only thing in the room was a symbol painted on the middle of the wall that gave us bad vibes. we googled it and turned out to be a symbol that represented some demon who preferred taking childrens souls or some shit (cant remember exactly what it was). anyway, its 1 am and all my roommates are asleep and i decide im going to go outside and smoke some weed and look at the moon and listen to some radiohead to relax myself after work. usually i take our pitbull pup, sweetie, with me and go around the back of the garage towards the forest. sweetie is so well trained that she will stick to you without a leash and typically scares off packs of coyotes that lurk around. however, as im walking towards the forest, sweetie stops and starts whining and wont follow me like she usually does so i tell her to come on but alas, sweetie refuses to go. i take her back to the apartment and have her sit in my bed and she is *shaking* at this point, but stupid me decided it was okay and went back around the garage outside and started walking towards the forest again, but this time i noticed something was walking alongside me (pretty much directly next to me) in my peripheral. i just kept going until something clicked in my head that said you did not imagine that and i turned to see what was next to me. i shit you not, what i saw was a white figure that was as tall as my waist, and it was wearing a dress, then something whispered in my ear and i took off running into the huge backyard area where i usually smoke. but wait, theres more. after smoking a bit and listening to in rainbows for the thousandth time in my life to calm me down, i decide i had to of imagined it and sweetie probably just saw a coyote that was bigger than usual. i decide im done and ready for bed. i had pretty much forgotten the white figure, so i decide ill head back the way i came since its the faster way back to the apartment. this is where most people dont believe me because i was high but in all of my years of smoking weed, i have never experienced something like this. i started walking into the huuuuge open area that has the forest behind it and i saw something running in the darkness. curious me kept watching to see what it was and i could make out two legs and that it was pretty large but full on sprinting. when i noticed that this large, hulking shadow person thing was full on sprinting towards me though and beginning to show itself in the moonlight, i booked it. i could hear something following me all the way back until i got to our door. my friends have told me some of their stories too but no one believes the last part of mine. i know what i saw and i know it was real. weed has never made me hallucinate, i wasnt so tired that i was imagining things, and ive never had this happen to me again after this event. that shit fucking happened.

"not so scary, but today, i was tying my shoelaces to go do some gardening, and as i look towards the clock, out of the corner of my eye, i could've sworn that i saw a black figure dash across the living room really fast. my sister always does this, so i called ""annabelle, where are you?"" and my sister responds from in her room, which is adjacent to the living room, and from my angle, i would've been able to see if anyone were to cross. completely puzzled, and sorta spooked, i turn my head back towards the living room, only to see the figure dash back. &#x200b; haven't told anyone, but am spooked"
3069	41514	40	bt3zc7	eoujsc7	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i moved into my new apartment, my mom gave me her fathers trunk from the vietnam war, which i used as a tv stand. my mom has always lied to me about how he died in the war, however my father enlightened me as to how he committed suicide shortly after he returned home. my mom said she always how she never wanted the trunk and how she always felt odd having it, and told me to get rid of it. but i insisted on keeping it. fast forward to me getting a roommate. i tell him the story of my grandfather and the trunk. he asks if we can go through it, and i said sure. we figured out he killed himself after receiving multiple letters from credit unions regarding credit card fraud. to this day nobody believes my roommate and me, but two hours after we go to bed, i wake up to the absolute deafening blare of an ambulance siren. i mean it gave that uncomfortable rattling deep in your ears that industrial fire alarms do. in a panic i cover my ears and leap out of bed and leave my room. im met with my roommate standing in the hall plugging his ears. the moment we saw each other the siren stopped. we both looked outside, no ambulance. never consulted with neighbors, but when i went to work at my 911 job and asked night shift if they sent anybody to my apartment complex or if a fire alarm went off that night, they said absolutely not. that nights call logs proved them correct. none of my friends believed us but we knew what we heard. it was nuts.
3070	41514	41	bt3zc7	eouk4ls	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was around 12 years old i woke in the middle of the night needing to use the toilet. my room was unusually dark so i quickly got up and walked over to my bedroom door only when i reached for the light switch my hand touched the window which was on the other side of the room. i began to feel incredibly disoriented so i stood still for a minute to let my eyes adjust to the darkness. for some reason the room became darker, i'm talking absolute blackness. i thought that maybe i'd somehow turned around in my sleep and woken up with my head at the bottom of the bed which is why i'd walked to the wrong side of the room. i took a breath and walked to where the door should've been. i reached for the door but could only feel wallpaper. this went on for what felt like half an hour, no matter which direction i went in, i kept ending up on the opposite side of the room to where i should have been. so there i was, sliding my hands around the walls, frantically trying to find my bedroom door. at this point i'm terrified and crying. i stumbled back in to the middle of the room and got back in to bed. after my heart stopped racing i decided to try again. this time, my bedroom door was right where it had always been. i turned on the light, my pillows were were at the correct end of the bed, everything was in it's place. it was the freakiest experience and i slept with my door open for years after.
3071	41514	38	bt3zc7	eoukzpm	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 4 or 5, this guy used to come to my window every night. the first time, my curtains were closed, and i heard a little tapping sound. my bed was right against the window, so i rolled over and opened the curtains, thinking it was one of my brothers being stupid. it was some dude i didn't know, at eye level with me. then, while holding eye contact with me, he started doing what looked like sign language. it went on for a few minutes, then he nodded at me and walked off. happened the next night, and the night after that, and for the next three months until we moved away. the window was open; if he'd wanted to abduct me, he could have at any time. every damn day i told my family, and they never once believed me about the sign language guy. they used to call him my imaginary friend, and to this day, they tell me i made it all up. i was wide awake, and i know what the hell i saw, though.
