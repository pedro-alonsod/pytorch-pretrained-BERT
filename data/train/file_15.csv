7204	23318	12	bnlib2	en7fbsf	"people who were adults during y2k, what was the most radical action someone you know did to prepare for the ""apocalypse?"""	all of these stories are tame. my uncle (mid 40s at the time) who was born, raised, and continued to live his whole life in the upper midwest, actually moved himself into a communal bunker in the middle of december. this bunker was in the middle of the desert of arizona. i guess it was theoretically the safest place to be in the united states if the world's nukes all went off. he, and the other people he went into that bunker with, set it to a six month seal and they never left that bunker. naturally, given the conspiracist nature of my uncle, he didn't inform anyone of how long he'd be there. i'm assuming he figured it didn't matter since we'd all be dead. he did tell us he was going somewhere safe. we were starting to wonder if he'd ever come back. he finally did about june; i'm guessing it was a little too hot for his midwestern ass in arizona in summer and the embarrassment of coming home didn't outweigh that discomfort anymore.

7206	23318	13	bnlib2	en7pbmm	"people who were adults during y2k, what was the most radical action someone you know did to prepare for the ""apocalypse?"""	family was mormon, besides the usual food and water furniture that was popular at the time we all gathered at designated houses so if shit hit the fan we could benefit from our collective hordes. when it struck midnight one gal took all the kids banging pots and pans into the neighborhood while the adults strategized. when the kids came back she reported no power outages and we all decided it must have been a test by the lord. we were relieved and reassured in our righteousness that god changed his mind thanks to our obedience. thankfully i havent seen food and water furniture since, but imagine theyre still used in utah. not-an-edit: food and water furniture is when you have so much shit you pile all the cans into shapes of furniture (beds were popular as those are just flat rectangles), add a sheet of plywood on top of the cans, place a sheet over it, add the mattress and pillows like its a legit bed.
7207	23318	12	bnlib2	en80e13	"people who were adults during y2k, what was the most radical action someone you know did to prepare for the ""apocalypse?"""	i bought a good generator and stockpiled some gasoline, water and food. since i had two very young children, i didn't want to have to go to a shelter if there were any power disruptions. this was in the snowy north of the u.s. i did extensive research online, and i felt that there was enough reasonable doubt and concern to at least take what i felt were the minimal necessary precautions. - generator, i bought a 4000 w generac, with cast iron cylinder sleeve and overhead cam. it was expensive, but i didn't want a cheap one, with a lawnmower engine. i still own it, and it powers the furnace, fridge, microwave and lights when we lose power from storms. - gasoline, it was possible gas supplies could have been interrupted, so i purchased some plastic, 55 gallon barrels. i filled three with gasoline. i also had the 50 gallon tank in my boat filled, and all of my jerry jugs and portable boat gas tanks. all together, i had about 255 gallons of fuel. i estimated we could have had normal electricity for two months with this. in the end, it worked out ok, because gas prices went pretty high early in 2000, so i liked using up my cheap gas over a few months. - water, i had two, 55 gallon plastic barrels filled with water, preserved with the required drops of bleach. - food, we had a modest supply of food. we had a couple shelving units with dried and canned foods. nothing crazy. it was stuff we normally ate, so we used it all up eventually. - misc., i had rechargable batteries, candles, etc., all of the usual storm prep items too. overall, i feel i had adequate preparation, without going overboard. i didn't buy a shotgun, for example. i felt the prep was worth it, even if the risk was small, because i couldn't imagine how bad it would be to have to live in a shelter with an infant and a toddler. the only real expense was the barrels, which i got rid of. the generator was a great investment.

"my ex mother-in-law was living with her college professor, who had recently saved up some money to redo his bathroom. she convinced him that the rollback to 000 would indeed bring about the apocalypse and usher in unimaginable mayhem. he subsequently took the money he had saved for the bathroom refurbish and instead stockpiled food, water, supplies and, of course, a few guns. then they boarded up the windows and waited. ""mother"" was a bit touched in the head and mooched off this poor sap while collecting ssi from the gov't. that really irked me, so i bought her a cooler cup in the days leading up to new year's day that read: ""y2k - let's party"". needless to say, she didn't find it funny and told me i'd be sorry. in a way she was right; i wholly regretted marrying into that hills have eyes of a family. my wife and i divorced shortly thereafter. that's when the party really began."
