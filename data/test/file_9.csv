2431	44253	12244	bkkoq2	emhqc3r	whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	my wife has a friend who studied zoology who once told me that cows can't run or jump. i grew up with them. i - more than once - had to run after or away from them after they had jumped a fence. cows are fucking fast when they want to be.

"wrote software for a large, interactive art piece. it was presented in such a way that it encouraged self-discovery of how it was used, but it wasn't difficult and most people picked up on the main operation of it very, very quickly (as it should have been). there were three stations that interacted together but separated by some distance. i see some guy very flamboyantly operating the device (it created music, lights, and fire) and explaining how it works to a small crowd around him. i'm intrigued so i walk over to hear him. he's ""figured"" it all out and basking in the adulation of those around him. but, he's wrong! like, way off. so, after listening a bit, i gently, and politely, point out how it differs from what he is saying. he looks around at ""his"" crowd, and tells me i'm way off and don't get it; that i just don't understand. this is more perplexing because simple operation and observation contradicted what he was stating. anyway, i again, politely, explained a bit more to further illustrate where he was wrong. he told me i just didn't know what i was talking about. i hesitated and considered just thanking him and walking away but then thought better of it. i looked at him and told him i wrote the software for what he was doing, and had been writing and running it on my laptop at home every night for the last 6 months. the crowds attitude changed, people thanked me, and i wandered off. it was weird how invested that guy was in being right and the center of attention. at least he was polite at the end."
2433	44253	6185	bkkoq2	emhp906	whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	i work in lightning protection here in the states. i do the estimating and the designs for the largest company in the southeast. have for going on 7 years. certified through our industry's certification company. the amount of engineers and architects that love to argue with me about the code is astounding. i live that code. being i estimate and design systems, my main job is to know that code. the worst was the army corps of engineers. we had a project that their designer designed that was in the bid package drawings. pretty standard, pick out the materials requested and ignore the incorrect design. that is how we bid it, won it, and designed it. this would have provided them with a fully certified system. in our business, a u.l. master label certification is as close to a requirement for every job as anything can be. two weeks after we submit our design it comes back with a revise/resubmit stamp and a very snarky demand from the corps that we change our design to the one provided in the bid package. i went back and forth on email and calls with the engineers trying to explain to them that their system would not work, was potentially a dangerous hazard, and ultimately could not be certified or warrantied. the came back basically with we don't care what you say, we know better, do it. so i did. designed exactly like they had and put a disclaimer on the drawing saying there would be issues and we were not responsible. a few months go by, its installed and ready for certification. they call the inspector out and he fails it without even getting on the roof. the army is pissed and tried to come back at us. i politely forward the countless email chains to the officer in charge. now they scramble to get it up to code. as a consequence it resulted in us issuing a change order to bring it up to code that was around 75% of the original cost of the project. edit: this has also now been posted at r/maliciouscompliance. so go show the love over there and thanks for the advice. thank you for the silver!

2436	44253	13569	bkkoq2	emhq35t	whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	a new house gets built next door to mine, and shortly after the owners move in, they knock on my door to complain that my house is built too high. i explain that my house was/is built on flat ground and their builder has built their house lower, and undercut my fence. the guy proceeds to give a long winded spiel about how earthworks are done and my house is too high and i have to fix it. i then explain that i do earthworks for a living, have done the earthworks for 300+ houses in my suburb alone, and around 1200 in the local area. i name his builder, site supervisor, engineer, the exact floor levels in the street, and the law that says that he has to pay to fix my fence. he still hasn't paid, and legal procedures are beginning soon. edit1: earthworks in this case is the removal of topsoil and any mud/clay/organic matter from beneath where the house is going to go, and replacing it with clean compacted sand, trimmed dead flat to within 10mm. edit2: because his block was lowered and leveled to suit his engineer, he is responsible for retaining the land around him, which is now higher than his. edit3: i was prepared to let it slide, because his place being lower now helps my drainage in heavy rain. but when he wanted me to pay for his retaining wall responsibility, and would not pay for his half of the fence, i decided that i had enough bluster and bullshit. time to pay up.

2439	44253	2139	bkkoq2	emhu5xh	whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	my friend and i went to dapper day at disney last weekend, where people dress up in vintage wear. one of disney's photographers asked my friend if she was disney bounding (interpreting a disney character) and she replied that she was simply a generic dress circa 1955. the photographer began telling us how she was really much more late 1940s, and that we may have researched it, but he lived through it, and next time we should look at a picture. we are both professional theatrical costumers whose strengths lie in historical costuming and her dress was taken directly from a 1955 catalogue. further, based on his approximate age, and being generous that he may have aged well, this man was definitely not older than 5 in 1955.

"in the netherlands we have different sized glasses for our pilsner. they all have a different name. the smallest, 0,18l is called a flute (fluitje), the middle a vase (vaasje) and the large, 0,5l we just call ""half a liter"" or pint. sometimes the bar has a medium of 0.33l as well, that doesnt really have a name. anyway, most people drink flutes or vases. you'd order ""a flute, please"" or ""a vase, please"" and you'll always be served the house pilsner (moest well know one is heineken, of course) in the size you ordered. &#x200b; as you might have guessed by now, i am a bartender. i was at work in a bar and had a group of 5 dudes drinking vases, a lot of them too. thing is; is you order ""a beer"", you'll be served a vase of pilsner as a standard. everyone knows this, it's common knowledge (in the netherlands) and noone ever objects to it. these dudes had been ordering ""5 beers, please"" the whole night. they were served vases (so 0,25l) the whole night. when time came to pay, i gave them their bill and it said 35 x vase pf heineken. then they tried to argue with me that the glass i served them, the 0,25l one, is not a vase but a flute, that a flute was 0,25 and not 0,18 and that a vase is 0,33l. i told them dudes i was not going to argue about something as ridiculous as this, as anyone who drinks beer in the netherlands knows what a flute and a vase is, and everyone know what size they are. but they refused to pay, so i told them to google it. they did. they found a website that listed the sizes and names of the glasses, but they wouldnt believe it because ""the website must be owned by heineken"" sure, a flute and vase conspiracy, that's a new one. they told me the bar next door serves a vase of 0,33l for the same price we serve a 0,25l one, so they weren't going to pay. i told them to cut their crap, that i work in that bar too (i do) and that the price of a 0,33 was higher than our 0,25 and that it's not called a vase. he didn't believe me and looked up their drinks menu (as if it would even matter what the prices next door were, even if they would be lower). he found out that, once again, i was right, but had some bullshit excuse as to why i was still wrong. in the end i told them to pay or i'd call the cops, so they paid but said they were going to write a complaint e-mail which i encouraged them to do. at this point even other costumers were telling them to stop being ridiculous cunts. i kindly asked them to never return again. they came back in a week later, but i told them they would not be served, they tried ordering drink from my co-worker but he told them to fuck off too so they just stood at the bar for a while and left. fecking idiots."

"im a teachers aide at a school for deaf kids. one of my students is a completely deaf 5 year old whos parents dont sign at all, so he is very language-delayed (but learning fast!) he often tries to correct my sign language, even though hes been learning less than a year. its pretty cute, actually. edit: first of all, thanks for my first gold! secondly, there's been a lot of hate directed towards parents who don't learn to sign. while i have to agree that it's heartbreaking to know that some of these kids don't have full access to language at home, it's not usually because of neglectful parents. my school is for kids who are referred to as ""deaf plus"", meaning that they often have some other physical or mental disability along with hearing loss. these parents are very overwhelmed. in some cases (like with this student) it's a single parent, low income, with 2 children at home. while my school does offer free classes for parents, these kids come from all over the state, sometimes up to 2 hours away. it's not always easy for parents to make the drive, and arrange for child care (which is expensive!). but please recognize that these parents are doing everything they know how to do. they worked to get their children to my school in the first place. many of these kids have other services involved at home, such as child welfare advocates or dcf, who work with the families to come up with solutions. also, kids are resilient and adaptable. this student in particular doesn't have any other disabilities. there is another deaf school in the state for typical deaf kids and i hope he'll transfer there when he's a little older. he's going to excel. he's incredibly smart, as an awesome sense of humor, and is very strong willed. he'll be just fine! edit 2: if you really want to help, sign language is super fun to learn! there may also be similar schools in your area, or services for deaf adults with special needs. these places are always hiring because the job can be demanding. but if you're interested they can always be very rewarding. and we could use your help!"

"i specialise in mental health, and a friend tried to argue that bulimia is ""the throwing up thing"". after explaining that bulimia consists of the binge purge cycle, and that even though vomiting is a common purge method it's not the only one, she still didn't quite get it. she seemed to think that because it was a common method of purge, it must be present to be diagnosed as bulimia. i've had to make clarifications to many people about many different mental health issues, but that one stuck out, i think because of how certain she was that she was right - wasn't the first time she'd refuse to believe she was anything other than right. edit: a lot of responses have asked about other methods of purging, some include: abusing laxatives and dieting aids, abnormal amounts of exercise, periods of starvation to counter the binge, and using syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. edit: i just wanted to clarify the differences between anorexia and bulimia. someone with bulimia will likely have a very normal diet, but when they experience a depressive or anxious episode, they'll go on an uncontrolled binge. in more severe cases this binge could be higher than 2000 calories, on top of their normal daily intake. following a binge, the individual will feel enormous amounts of regret, anger, and/or fear about the binge, and they'll begin trying to purge it from their body in whatever way they choose. with anorexia, the individual will likely have reduced their daily calory intake to below 1000 calories, they may engage in compulsively checking the calory content of their food, and perhaps weighing foods that otherwise don't need to be weighed out. additionally, an indiviual with anorexia may also purge as an aid to their weight lose intentions."

(i am hoping to someday adopt a korean child [not an infant] and move him/her to the u.s.; therefore, i want to make sure i can fully communicate.) because of this, i was pretty serious about paying the bigger bucks for a private tutor. with her, i studied for an average of 20 hours per week, plus an additional 10 or so on my own time. i dedicated a lot of time to my studies, in addition to practicing newly acquired skills with the locals. i would say i learned a lot. when i returned to the u.s., i discovered my co-worker (who is one of those know-it-all, entitled people) started talking to me about how shed taken up an interest in korean as well. mostly because of that one k-pop group. which is fine and all, cool. i really didnt care. but its when she started going off about how she learned how to read the alphabet but got confused with some of it that ticked me off. i literally took all of my lunch break to sit down and explain it to herbecause i knewbut she kept telling me it didnt seem right. no matter how much i told her, she said it was wrong. shes the type who always has to be right. even if shes wrong, shes right. even her opinions have to be superior. because i hate debating, i would usually just drop the subject. but this time i was so. enraged. which i never get. after a few minutes of listening to her thinking out-loud, i said: look, i went to this country, studied my ass off with a tutor, and youre telling me its not right? sure, go ahead and learn it wrong. if thinking youre right helps you sleep at night. . . we dont talk about it anymore.

2517	44253	46	bkkoq2	emhqvls	whats the worst thing someone tried to correct you about something youre specialized at?	im a teacher. in any given class, i have limited english proficiency (lep) kids, i have 504 kids, and i have special ed kids in addition to regular ed kids. this means that when we take a test or quiz, there are several different versions. some are longer, some are shorter, some are simplified, all sorts of things. i had a parent call and accuse me of giving her kid the harder tests on purpose because i didnt like him. i had to pull in a principal who eventually got her to understand the situation. she wouldnt take my word for it. keep in mind that a students 504/special ed information is very private, so i cant just say, kids who get xyz test are special ed, and your kids not. she was miffed that her child had to share a classroom with different kids and im just like. ?

"was sitting around with some friends at a restaurant when a helicopter flew over pretty low. one of the guys i didn't know too well (and who clearly didn't know me too well) mentioned something about how helicopters work and i politely corrected him. disagreement followed and he was getting pretty adamant he was right until he finally just gave in and said something along the lines of, ""ok well technically yes, but i was just going with a simplified version so you could understand. i promise you i know more about this than you do."" few moments have been as gratifying as the one where i just wordlessly passed him my flight instructor license over the table (and he didn't know what it was)."
