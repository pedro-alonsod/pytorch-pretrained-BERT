7961	18722	2125	bue7cv	epbwpmp	what was your schools huge scandal?	my school district gave all high school students laptops that they could bring home with them to use for school work. they could also remotely activate the webcams and spy on students (although of course they didn't tell us this). one kid got caught smoking weed this way while he was in his room at home and i think was going to get suspended. he sued the district in response for invasion of privacy and won the case. it got national media attention for a little while
7962	18722	7343	bue7cv	epbvkl5	what was your schools huge scandal?	the assistant principal died in a car accident. there was a big, somber school assembly in his honor. his wife said a few words, and then his 14-year-old daughter came to the microphone to say a few words. she sort of snapped and unloaded about how he was not a good guy, he was a monster who had been abusing her and her little sisters and using them for kiddie porn for years - and she was glad he was dead. i've never heard a room full of people grow so silent, so fast.
7963	18722	6545	bue7cv	epb818g	what was your schools huge scandal?	everyones favorite teacher was in fact banging that student he always hung out with, who would sit in his lap and would visit him after she graduated. they could not have been anymore obvious. edit: for everyone asking this was a performing arts high school in san diego, from about 2005-2008. edit: i dont know if this is allowed but [heres](https://m.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/news-ticker/2011/dec/21/failure-to-report-student-teacher-sexual-relations/) a link with pertinent info. she got a $1.25 million settlement because no one acted.
7964	18722	8705	bue7cv	epb8wal	what was your schools huge scandal?	my high school districts's superintendent hired a relative who wasn't qualified for the job, increased the salary of administrators every year, used the district's credit card to buy meals, groceries, gas, personal electronics, and gift cards. when the state audit went through they said that the overpay of administrators and the personal spending cost the school district around 1.1 million dollars. her husband was also an administrator. when she eventually got caught, she just retired and for some reason never faced federal charges. when she retired she had a $260,518 salary. my favorite part is that the state audit discovered that the district's credit card was used to purchase logging equipment the same month the superintendent's husband filed paperwork to open a timber company. everyone knew there was corruption in the school district, but no audits or investigations happened until someone was threatened by the superintendent's husband on facebook.
7965	18722	2262	bue7cv	epbnjla	what was your schools huge scandal?	a year after i graduated hs, a woman was stabbed 40+ times with a pair of scissors while jogging on our track on a sunday. one of the guys in that years senior class wound up hanging around the track over the following days, obsessively pestering investigators with questions and theories, so naturally some suspicion fell on him. when the womans description of her assailant (she survived!) matched him spot-on, he was arrested, and both the scissors used and his bloody clothes were found at his house. dude was sentenced to 10+ years in prison. end of story, right? wrong. two years after the trial, the jailed kid is ordered released after his little brother, one year younger and a dead lookalike for his big bro, is popped for violent sexual assault on a woman, and confesses to the stabbing during questioning. turns out the older brother took the fall for him, falsely confessing so that he could keep his younger sib out of jail. dude never told anyone, but did admit the lie after his younger brothers arrest and confession. i knew both kids when i was a student there. both brothers were definitely thought to be weirdly intense, but their behavior was attributed to their military dads strict style of parenting, and not anything darker.

7971	18722	6494	bue7cv	epba3fc	what was your schools huge scandal?	i went to a small christian high school that also had a middle and elementary school on the grounds. the principal of the high school had a child that was in my grade. one day he comes over the intercom and announces that he's stepping down from his position. he then goes on to talk about how he and the female gym coach had been having an 'emotional affair' for the last few months. this announcement goes through every speaker in all three schools. i remember everyone in my class looking over at his daughter who had a look a complete surprise on her face. from what i gathered this was the first time she was hearing about all of this. &#x200b; shortly after the gym teacher also left her position, but the most interesting part? the gym teacher had no idea this was going on. she was just doing her job and thought she was friends with everyone. the principal read more into their relationship and decided to go to the church with it and they made this decision. the gym teacher left her job out of shame and had to spend a lot of time explaining to her husband what exactly was going on. &#x200b; edit: adding information that others have asked about. the gym teacher's husband took a little time to realize that there was no actual affair that went on. after that they rumors and gossip in the area got to be too much and he ended up getting a different job pretty far away and moved them both to start fresh. &#x200b; the principal and his wife got a divorce within a day or so of the announcement. the wife got custody of all three kids, plus i think eventually their house and a fair amount of money. the former principal took a job selling either cars or furniture, i can't remember which, and pretty much faded from the radar. i don't think his eldest daughter had anything to do with him after all of that. i wanna say that she intentionally made sure he stayed away from her wedding.

7983	18722	6309	bue7cv	epb7wil	what was your schools huge scandal?	there was a male and female high school pe teacher that essentially shared an office. they always got along really well, and kids would always joke that they we were dating. we were just dumb kids, so we never really thought anything of it. after a couple years, they both started acting weird around each other, and there were rumors that he left his wife and kids for this pe teacher. this wasn't actually true though. what actually happened was they added on a bedroom to their house and the pe teacher moved in. the kids pretty much just had two moms and everyone got along wonderfully. it was strange for about a year, and then it was business as usual. i guess they're going on about 15 years strong.
7984	18722	304	bue7cv	epbdarj	what was your schools huge scandal?	"in my sophomore year, a group of seniors decided a good senior prank would be to sneak into the bus garage and slash the tires on buses in order to get out of school. ended up causing over $40,000 in damages and did cancel school one day, and the police came to the school to do interviews all that week. apparently, most of them got away with it because of how the buses were parked at the time (some of them were doubled up, so they only hit the 2nd row of buses, which made camera views ""too far away to positively identify"". after that year, our and the neighboring districts changed their bus lots so that the buses were single row only and beefed up camera systems. also, as per many posts on this thread, found out after i graduated that my chemistry teacher in 10th grade was arrested years later in the neighboring state for trying to meet underage girls for sex. he was at least in his 50's."

7999	18722	3041	bue7cv	epb1d7s	what was your schools huge scandal?	there were two teachers at my school who were in their late 20s early 30s who were married. the husband cheated on her with another teacher in her late 40s. their affair was known by basically everyone, they were even caught in the same car after a school excursion by passing students, they were on the same seat. eventually the wife found out and her office was right next to the mistress apparently and they moved them to opposite ends of the teacher offices. also the husband and wife kept teaching at my school for the entire time i was there and the husband wound up engaged to his mistress. apparently the principal was totally on the wives side and she got days off to prepare for court whilst the husband didn't. how do nearly all the students know all this? apparently teachers like gossiping as much as students.
8000	18722	3678	bue7cv	epb5snu	what was your schools huge scandal?	i recently learned that principal of a school i used to go to got fired. i was kinda glad because he was a dickhead. the reason he got fired? after communism was abolished in poland apparently if you wanted to have administrative job you had to sign a document that said you didn't work with communists. recently it came to light that he in fact did work with communists. &#x200b; edit: since this blew up a bit i did additional reading up on this. you have to declare if you worked with communist police which can mean anything from just being a low rank worker up to being a snitch for them. declaring you did work with the police doesn't disqualify you from the position but you have to be accepted by a public vote for the position. &#x200b; he's still working as a teacher. details about his work with the police are not released but since he's not in jail it wasn't anything bad. punishment for the fact that he decided to lie about this is being banned from administrative work for 3 years (max is 10) and of course instead of his public opinion will be that he probably is a shady person since he lied instead that of an honest person.
8001	18722	3368	bue7cv	epavdvj	what was your schools huge scandal?

8002	18722	2022	bue7cv	epbaqph	what was your schools huge scandal?	ill preface this by saying i went to a private christian school in mississippi which is a scandal in itself. when i was in the 6th or 7th grade, one of our coaches got fired and arrested for sleeping with a girl under age. problem was her mom found the messages from him to her and she denied it all. he is still in jail to my knowledge and she transferred schools. there was another coach doing the same thing and he just left our school. a few years later at a basketball game we were talking to some friends from that school about the whole situation and it turns out the coach that left was now coaching at the school we were playing. we unintentionally got him to leave that school as well. &#x200b; runner up: a girl got pregnant her senior year and was not allowed to come to classes but instead had to sit in the pa room and listen to her classes over the speaker and pa system. it was cruel and unusual and her classmates had a sit in to allow her to walk during graduation.

8009	18722	738	bue7cv	epcebaj	what was your schools huge scandal?	man i wish i wasn't so late to this party. around 1998, someone took a dump in a toilet at my high school. this turd was (no joking) the circumference of a coke can, and the length of a size 13 shoe. it was so big that it couldn't be flushed. this shit made it's way around the school quickly, and there was a line out the door to that bathroom for an hour at least before the facility caught wind. from what we heard, it took the janitor 4 flushes after breaking it down with a plunger. fast forward a couple weeks to the real aftermath. someone managed to take a picture of this turd and created a website dedicated to this mammoth shit. the person that made the site was dumb enough to use his name on the site and the school threatened him with expulsion if he didn't take the site down. he said no. so he had to go in front of the school board to make his case about how it's his right to have a website dedicated to a massive shit. this made the local news and made my junior year extremely funny.

(i live in the deep south btw) long story short, the trip got banned and the teacher wound up stepping down after receiving so much hate for ""trying to make the kids muslim"" even though she was a white, christian woman. i went to a predominantly white high school, and all the white moms basically teamed up to complain to the school about her and tear her to shreds. i think the teacher is doing govt work now, she totally quit teaching after this. god i fucking hate my hometown"

8024	18722	278	bue7cv	epceafe	what was your schools huge scandal?	a 7 year old kid was found dead in the school's washroom, bearing brutal knife slashes on his throat. it was a national news for many many months during which the investigation was ongoing. initially it was claimed by the police that one of the bus drivers was responsible for the murder. he confessed of the same, a day later, claiming that he was going to sexually assault the kid but when he resisted, the driver killed him. but the kid's parents were not convinced that that was the case and claimed that the school was hiding a bigger conspiracy, since many of the evidence in the crime scene were tampered with before the police were notified and arrived on the scene. they pressured the government to involve the cbi and let them investigate instead of the local policemen. later on, giving in to the rising pressure from the whole country, including a supreme court ruling, the cbi was called in to investigate. the cbi are basically the indian equivalent of the fbi. during the investigation, the cbi found out that the driver was just a scapegoat and was forced to confess, which was claimed by other drivers since the very beginning. the driver later said that he was forced under police torture to admit to killing the child. as the investigation continued, it turned out that the murder was committed by a 15 year old kid, who apparently wanted to postpone the upcoming parent-teacher conference since the parents were gonna be notified of his recent bullying attitude towards his classmates. so this guy decided that the best way to get them delayed was for kill someone and cause a police investigation in the school. his name was never publicly announced, but the students obviously knew who the guy was. i knew him personally and i could never have guessed in a thousand years that that guy could do something like that. it's also unbelievably scary to think that he also almost got away with the murder. i don't know how the rules work in regards to this, so i don't know if i should post a link for a news report on this, but i'll do so it anyone asks for it.

8072	18722	55	bue7cv	epc5ham	what was your schools huge scandal?	i got one that made the news. it happened one semester before my first. one of my professors relayed the story to my ootl ass, so i'll try to stick to how she told it. tl;dr at bottom. my university has a faculty union. around 10 years ago, they noticed the spike in university shootings and wanted to do something about it. at the time, all the buildings on campus had outside locks on their classrooms and each professor had a key. in an active shooter setting, professors would have to lock the door. that meant that they would have to step outside the classroom, find the key on their key ring, get it in the lock with their undoubtedly unsteady hands, and step back inside the classroom to close the door and block it. this, of course, is extremely dangerous. it's time consuming, puts the professor in immense amounts of danger, and by extension, puts the students in danger as well. if a shooter sees this, they can shoot the professor and stride in to massacre the students. the union decided that they wanted a solution: installation of simple lockable thumbturn deadbolts on the inside. that way, all they would have to do is close the door and turn the lock. no stepping into the path of a shooter, no fiddling with keys, nothing. the union approached the higher-ups with this idea and they were declined on the basis of expense. they asked the next year; nope, too expensive. they asked the next year. and the next. and the next. over a decade passed. finally, with the parkland shooting earlier in the year, something had to be done. if a shooter comes into a classroom, what would be the best item to use to defend yourself? well, ideally, a weapon, but the university has a no weapons policy. the next best thing? something small, heavy, easy to aim and throw, and guaranteed to stun them. something like a cue ball or.a hockey puck. with the help of some local businesses, the union bought over 2500 hockey pucks and distributed them across campus. students were told to keep them in their backpacks and to use them as a last resort against a shooter. while news outlets quickly picked it up and assumed that they were serious about using them to defend against shooters, there was a deeper purpose to them. each of them had a code on the back that would lead students to a donation page to purchase indoor locks. it was seized within the day. many outlets had articles about it, interviewing students, professors, campus police, etc., who all played along with their initial assumption. the message was clear: because they wouldn't protect us, we had to take our defense into our own hands. here's a couple articles: [https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/us/hockey-pucks-oakland-university-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/us/hockey-pucks-oakland-university-trnd/index.html) [https://www.wxyz.com/news/ou-professors-trained-to-fight-active-shooters-using-hockey-pucks](https://www.wxyz.com/news/ou-professors-trained-to-fight-active-shooters-using-hockey-pucks) and here's the snopes: [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hockey-pucks-shooting-defense/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hockey-pucks-shooting-defense/) the best part? when she found out, the university president was in a meeting with other university presidents across the state. she had no idea that the union's idea had been blocked for so long. the next day, when professors arrived, indoor thumbturn locks were being installed. tl;dr: frustrated union lets the country know that my university apparently doesn't have enough money to protect them from shooters.
