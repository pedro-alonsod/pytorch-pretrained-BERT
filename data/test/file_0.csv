2735	41748	732	bmyv30	en1fdkz	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	not sure if i can call it satisfying, but it's still a good one in 2003 i wrote a thesis on mortgage backed securities. the whole thing did not make sense to me and told my professor as much, but added: 'what do i know? i'm just a student and wall street guys must know what they're doing.' and then 2008 happened.
2736	41748	2393	bmyv30	en20er1	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"late to the party here, but what the hell, 'cause this story is bonkers. back in the early '90s i was in my early twenties and, as people in their early twenties often do, i spent a lot of late nights at my local denny's hanging out with friends and drinking cheap coffee. the late-night wait staff was pretty small, so my friends and i wound up getting to know them pretty well -- socializing with them as well. some of them would hook us up with free fries or sodas, that kind of thing, and every now and again if things were slow, they'd sit at our booth with us. one of the people who would hang out with us was charles. charles was an older guy in his 50s who was very nice to my friends and me, but he was a little. creepy. he would never get overt about it, but he definitely embraced the whole 'creepy uncle' persona, maybe even being a little tongue-in-cheek about it. he'd tell the girls in my group how pretty they were, and how he wished he was still young, that sort of thing. reading between the lines, he was telling them he wished he could have sex with them. but this is not going where you think it is. i'm just setting the stage, y'all. the guy was a little weird, but he *was* a nice guy to us. all the same, i remember telling people ""charles has a secret. he's in his fifties, slinging coffee at an all-night restaurant, but he comes off as educated and sort of worldly. he talks about traveling and living well -- i don't know what it is, but charles is damaged. i bet he killed somebody or something."" i was convinced that the ""nice guy"" bit was a cover for something dark. uh, yeah. so as my group got older, people came and went, some of us fell out with others, some of us got real jobs and couldn't stay up until 4:00am at a denny's, and we eventually stopped hanging out there. never really gave charles much thought after that, for years. then i saw charles on the news. turns out charles was charles rothenberg, a man who, in 1983, was going through a bad divorce. in what i understand was originally intended to be a murder-suicide, he drugged his six-year-old son david, doused the boy in kerosene, and lit him on fire. david survived, but was horribly scarred for the rest of his life. charles continued to get into criminal trouble, and was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison as a result of california's ""three strikes"" law. he's still in prison today, but in the late '90s he changed his name to ""charley charles,"" because sure, why not. in 1988 there was a tv movie based on the incident called ""david,"" which starred bernadette peters as his mother. meanwhile his son david became one of michael jackson's child-friends and eventually an artist. when he was 19, he visited charles in prison, apparently reading a prepared statement to him: ""charles, you are not my father. you are an impostor. parents don't hinder their children from experiencing a normal childhood. i wish that you could experience the trauma and pain that i have gone through."" afterward, david told the press ""he wanted me to know that he loved me. the last thing i said was, 'no you don't.' and i walked out."" in a somewhat bizarre turn, david later legally changed his own name to ""dave dave,"" mirroring the ""charley charles"" name his father adopted. i have no idea if this is coincidental somehow, but the irony is not lost on me, that's for sure. dave dave even appeared on the larry king show to talk about michael jackson when he died. if i recall correctly, he defended jackson against the reports of child molestation and denied he was a victim of jackson's. unfortunately dave dave himself passed away last year, at the age of 42 -- his ongoing medical issues, which were the result of his burn injuries, eventually killed him. and in my opinion, that means charles was ultimately successful in murdering his son. so, yeah. i called it -- charles was harboring something dark when he was getting free fries for my friends and telling the girls how pretty they were. i just had no idea how dark."

"probably too late but i want to share this anyway. the last few months of my wife's pregnancy with my daughter, the little baby would regular as clockwork, around 1030pm, put her feet against my wife's ribs and try to straighten her legs so she could head butt her way out of my wife. bam - headbutt to the inside of your . whatever. my wife would fucking jump up cursing like a sailor every time. it was painful, but also hilarious, reliable, and i guess we knew she'd be an active little kid well before she was born. &nbsp; cut to the evening of her birth - the doctor is telling us around 9pm that things are going well, but he's going to go get dinner because he has't eaten and there's no way this kid is coming out before midnight. i look at my wife, look at the doc, and say ""don't go far, the kid is going to deliver herself around 1030pm, i promise you. you're just going to have to catch her."" he laughed, told us he's been doing this a long time, and he wasn't worried. 1025 he's rushing in and barely gets his gloves and scrubs on before my daughter shoots herself out of mommy like a greased bullet. direct quote from the doctor looking at me as he holds my little darling, ""well, i guess even i can learn things still."" i don't blame him at all - who would believe parents about something like that? but that kid had done so many test runs, on such a regular schedule, i knew there was no stopping her. and fair game, getting headbutted daily for a month or whatever as a trade off to having a *very* short and easy labor? there are worse deals!"

2741	41748	1177	bmyv30	en1wklc	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	i've been practicing law in the same venue for many years with the same judges and attorneys. new hotshot attorney out of law school is opposing counsel. it's a death case. my client was not responsible, but opposing counsel would not listen to reason. on the eve of trial, my client is willing to offer a decent amount to settle the case. i call the attorney and encourage her to take it. i told her that if she didn't accept, when we went to trial the next day i was going to have all her evidence thrown out and strike her witnesses. she thought i was bluffing. i assured her i was not. i told her to call any attorney in the area and ask them if i was a straight shooter. she basically told me to fuck and and that she'd see me at trial. sure enough, the judge excludes her documentary evidence (all hearsay) and strikes her witnesses. she has zero evidence when the judge is through with her. her client was in tears. i think she got sued for malpractice. she wasn't at that firm long after that debacle. but i fucking told her that would happen.

"my wife was watching some tv show. i happened to walk in during some scene in which it was raining out, and a guy and a gal were looking at each other through their car windows as their kid went from one car to the other. i said ""here comes the scene where they make up"" without knowing any of the background of the show. my wife started telling me that it won't happen. they had had a failed relationship years earlier (hence the kid) and the woman was with a great guy. right after she said that, the woman got out and ran to the guy's car basically professing her love for him."

2753	41748	16654	bmyv30	en1k8v8	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	in high school my best friends little sister (16 at the time) brought home her new 18 year old bf from work to meet the family. i was over at the time and talked to him for a while because we were the same age. after meeting him something was off, i got the impression that 1) he was much older than claiming 2) had been in jail. i wound up saying something to my friend, who told his parents and sister. long story short the family freaked out on my for spreading rumors that weren't true, telling me to mind my own business etc. 2 years later the sister comes home from a date with him in tears. he finally came out and admitted to her that 1) he was 30, not the now 20 he was saying 2) he had spent 2 years in prison, but refused to say for what. i was very quick to point out to the family how i called this years earlier and was basically shamed out of their house. edit: rather than responding to everyones comments i figured it was easier to add an edit on a few things. 1) im really not sure how the family didnt immediately pick up he was a lot older. i can only venture to guess and would rather not speculate. also, this was before the time of being able to google someone and look up their records 2) im still close with my friend and his family, there was a point later on where i got a gee, maybe we should have listened to you. 3) i have no clue what he was in jail for, still dont know. 4) for those who called me insensitive for pointing out i was right almost immediately, i was 20 had previously taken a lot of grief for calling this out and it wasnt exactly let go quickly on their end.

2761	41748	13048	bmyv30	en0yp70	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	"when a penny stock i bought around $0.03/share blew up to over $3. my only regret is not buying a lot more shares. edit: for those asking, here's my take based on my very limited experience with penny stocks. you can usually buy penny stock through your typical broker. you must be particularly wary of penny stocks because they can be subject to the phenomenon of ""pump and dump"": one or more people (likely those who have stake in whatever company is offering penny stock) hype it up and hope that people will buy. as the price creeps up, those stakeholders may decide to sell and thus reap the rewards, while those who naively assume going long is best will hold on to that stock with hopes that it'll blow up. the number of penny stock failures i've invested in far outnumbers the successes. like i've bought hundreds of thousands of shares of stock less than $0.01/share and seen it basically become valueless as the stakeholders have presumably sold their stake before the per share price hits the toilet. it's extremely hit-or-miss, to say the least."

"in my 1st year in college, on my level 1 motor vehicle engineering course, we were being taught how to change spark plugs and adjust the timing on engines. so my then friend, we'll call him ryan, is working with me on a 1998 audi a3 1.8 non-turbo. we both agreed that i should do the timing, as i was more confident about it (which makes little sense thinking about it now), and that he wanted to remove the spark plugs. when he was taking out the 1st plug, i noticed that he wasn't very careful about it. for those of you who don't know much about cars, spark plugs are made of ceramic and metal, and the ceramic is easy to snap if you're not careful, and when it does, little pieces of ceramic will end up falling inside the cylinder, which, if the car is started, can cause *serious* damage to your engine. anyways, i tell ryan that he should be careful about taking out the spark plugs. he just says ""nah nah man it's fine, they're made of metal."" i didn't reply as i noticed that he didn't give a shit about the job. so he unscrews the 2nd spark plug and pulls really hard as he can't fully undo it, and right there, i hear the spark plug snap in half. and to top it off, the entire ceramic part of the spark plug fell inside the cylinder. i immediately told him to tell the tutor, which he of course didn't. so then after he moves away from the car, our tutor tells us to move the car to a different spot. i give ryan the keys and say ""go on then"", as i didn't have my license then. so he gets in, and starts the car, and right from the start, me and the tutor can hear that something is knocking inside the engine, and before the tutor could tell ryan to switch it off, we hear a very loud pop, and the engine stops by itself. right there and then, out loud i looked ryan straight in the eyes and said ""i fucking called it you dickhead."" he got kicked off the course since this was *an actual teacher's car* edit: to those of you saying that this could also be my fault for the car getting fucked, you're not wrong. i'm glad i've changed since then."

""hey, i know you are probably sick of hearing this, but i am so very sorry for what i said about your dad, brianna. please forgive me, i still don't know why i'd say such a thing."" she sort of chuckled and said, ""it's no big deal, he molested all of us."" i never questioned my intuition again, because i fucking called it the second i saw that perv. edit: thanks for the gold by ""us,"" i believe she meant all of the daughters in the family, there were three. i don't know if any of my former friends were molested. last i heard, i was still a shit talker about her dad and i wasn't going to correct them and humiliate her again. i figure she can tell who she wants. no, i'm not proud that i called her dad a child molester. it all came out because her younger sister said something to a church minister, but he was never brought into the criminal justice system and brianna moved out of state. she and i remained friendly and kept in touch for several years but lost contact. i still do feel really bad about saying that about her dad to her, it was a shitty thing to say. i could have kept it to myself and just stayed away from their house but drunk me doesn't do that i guess. i'm surprised at all the people who are responding that they have a similar story. i'd like to read them."

2813	41748	52	bmyv30	en1nryc	"whats your greatest most satisfying ""i fucking called it"" moment?"	idk about satisfying, but do yall remember the runaway bride? not the movie, the actual woman? well, there was a woman who was kidnapped before her wedding (maybe a couple days before, if im not mistaken), and the whole world started looking for her. if i remember correctly, she was able to make a phone call to her family and she told them she was kidnapped by some mexicans. as soon as she said that, i knew she was lying. whenever people specify a race when explaining a crime, my ears perk up, but i understand why she did it. people will believe it. either way, my gf at the time got sooo mad at me saying, you always think you know it all! this woman was kidnapped and all you can do is think of something to be right about! have some compassion. couple days later, guess who shows up? apparently she didnt wanna get married and decided to get kidnapped rather than call it off. luckily the state made her pay back all the money they spent to search for her, but of course, no jail time. i never said i fucking told you so to my gf, but i know she was waiting for it by how she was acting, didnt speak much, acted aloof. so we never spoke of it after. and the notebook. as soon as the movie started i was like, oh, so they have alzheimers. am i the only one who saw that coming? and old man that we dont know goes to read to a random woman everyday?

"oh boy do i have a good story for this one. in college i went to a theme park with my then-boyfriend, right before i moved away to california (we had decided to break up as he didn't want to do long-distance, mostly his decision). he had driven us in his suv. he has really bad eyesight and had just gotten brand new glasses, i believe they cost about $400. as we're going up the stairs in line for a roller coaster, i said, ""hey, why don't you give me your glasses and i'll stick them in my purse."" he said, ""nah, it'll be fine."" and i said, ""are you sure? you're making a $400 bet where if you win you just get to keep what you already have."" and he said, ""the forward momentum of the roller coaster will keep them on my face."" so i thought, he's an adult, whatever. literally first drop of the roller coaster i hear him yell over the roar of the wind, ""do you have my glasses???"" so we spent the next hour walking around the base of the roller coaster looking for them and leaving a report at the lost and found booth. i then had to drive us home in his suv, which i had never driven before. he had to attempt to navigate while practically blind. so yeah, still pretty smug about that one."

"co worker didn't like the new boss we had to transition under. from day 1 co-worker was openly being insubordinate, talking shit about new boss behind their back. but the thing that put it over the top for me was the day she came into our breakroom ""bragging"" that new boss had asked her to do something and she'd handed new boss back a sticky note with a number of who to call in order to resolve the situation. co-worker was convinced she was invaluable and wouldn't be let go because all of our clients love her so much (they don't). the worst part was that she hated new boss so much she brought the whole vibe of the workplace down to a hell hole. every day there was something new to bitch about. we were all just venting receptacles to her. even though i consider her a friend i was quietly beginning to pray for the day our boss had enough. i told my good friends that worked with us ""yup she's gonna get fired"" and sure enough, a few months later she was let go. when she told me, she called the office crying on the phone and i could barely muster an ""i'm sorry"" because i was so relieved that i wouldn't have to work with her anymore."

"i would often hear scraping of furniture over the floor in the studio apartment above mine, sometimes in the dead of night. it had kept me up a few times, but as i didn't have anything going on at the time, it didn't bother me that much. i did once knock on her door to ask what was going on, she apologized and stopped that night. however, for about a month i'd have to get up at 7 a.m. during the week, so i knocked on her door politely asked if she could stop doing it after 11 in the evening. she said okay. there was some loud talking going on in the hallway (sign at the bottom floor clearly states absolute silence in the hallways), went upstairs and knocked on the door opposite to hers just after it closed. it was her again, and the guy who owns the room. i didn't approach it too well, she got pissed and brought up an issue she had with me. fine, that was fair enough. but then she proceeded to claim ""i haven't done it in months"", and ""okay, i won't do it again."" both of which where obviously bullshit. i started to think with the insane amount of cleaning going on, that she had some form of ocd. friend came over, told me he used to date her. he didn't want to mention it, but i was able to put it together and ask about the ocd thing, which he confirmed. (and we're not talking ocd the way that people use it, actually diagnosed ocd.) at that point i felt pretty conflicted. i felt completely vindicated and was pissed at her lies. on the other hand, i know how difficult the issue can be and how hard it probably is to be confronted about it by someone who's mostly a stranger."
