6931	23706	1197	bm8dfx	emv81rn	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i was in some business college class and the professor was talking about something related to how celebrities brand themselves. someone in the class brought up shaun white as someone who had great celebrity branding but isn't really talked about a lot. the professor was indian and said he wasn't familiar with who that was. so my genius ass thought it would be perfect to say out loud ""i'm talking about mountain dews baby."" as a joke reference to that news cast where shaun white said he had been drinking all night but was underage and the news person asked him what he meant so he responded with ""i'm talking about mountain dews baby."" and we'll no one seemed to knew about that or at least didn't think it was funny as silence rang through the classroom and professor awkwardly moved on to a new topic. truly the most awkward situation i've been in and also the worst haunting moment of my life."

6933	23706	361	bm8dfx	emvl46p	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	so ive had the same 3 best friends since i was a kid friend 1 has an insanely hot older sister, like absolute smoke show, and me and friend 2 and 3 always thought she was super sexy somehow, friend 2 ends up sleeping with friend 1s said sister, and me and friend 3 know about it, but friend 1 does not one night, we are all drunk in my basement, and friend 1 and friend 2 end up getting in a roasting war. not essentially an argument or anything, just friendly banter and insults. friend 1 (the one with the hot sister) is really digging into friend 2 (the one who fucked the hot sister) and seems to be winning the roasting war. in a last ditch effort to recover from shame, friend 2 proceeds to drunkenly say yeah? well i fucked your sister!! after that, im pretty sure the tension in the room was so thick that it raised the temperature in the room by like 10 degrees. (we are all still best friends btw, friend 1 is still a little mad though but i cant blame him)

6936	23706	2533	bm8dfx	emuzmev	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i dunno if this is really the most awkward, but it was def awkward. i visited my bio dad's old church in mississippi a few years ago and spoke to his old preacher for a moment. one important detail for this story is that my dad died when i was seven, so a pretty good while back. my grandma told the preacher who i was: ""this is pomelo sr.'s daughter, pomelo!"" preacher: ""ohh! pomelo sr! tell him i said hi for me!"" me: ""sure thing!"" my grandma's face was priceless. we agreed the preacher would feel really awkward when he remembered later that my dad was dead."
6937	23706	17172	bm8dfx	emun2vp	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was a kid, we were on holiday and decided to go to a church. while we were there i decided that i would be funny if i would slap my dad's ass with both hands. so i ran in full speed to maximize the impact of the slap. i ended up slapping a stranger who also happend to walk next to a woman with a stroller in his hands which made me think it was my dad. it was even worse that my parents saw it as well. edit: because people are asking what happend afterwards. my parents just laughed at me, which made the guy laugh as well and then we just left the church i think.

6941	23706	14000	bm8dfx	emunwro	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"not awkward for me, but i was the reason for it. i served for a couple years and worked multiple restaurants in that time frame. i worked at a dennys, nightshift, best and worst job for many reasons. anyways there was a regular that came in often, drunk as a skunk and nasty as hell. he tipped really well but was so nasty to us girls. it never phased me so i served him often, he offered many many times to pay for ""extra service"" and tried to get me to leave with him often. of course i never did but a couple months later im working a new place (little more high end) i work mornings here, and this was a sunday morning church rush. guess who was sat in my section, my nasty regular from my last job with his entire family. his wife, kids, parents, the whole group, fresh outta church. the look on this mans face when i walked up and said hello. he was red as a firetruck, and i made it worse by asking if he remembered me. he left me a huge tip, probably because i didn't bring up his nasty mouth and grabby hands from his late drunken nights. ***edit*** i was a waitress, that's what i meant by serving**"
6942	23706	12981	bm8dfx	emur2rw	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was a teenager with a boner. pretty standard so far. i walked downstairs and had to tuck it in my pajamas so the head is sticking strait up and the erection is pinned against the body so the boner isn't noticeable. well, when i put my t-shirt on it fell behind the tip so if you looked at my wasit line you could clearly see the tip of my penis. i was talking to my mom for a few minutes and she was flushed red in the face and quickly trying to kill conversation - *not* something my mom is known for. i walked away, saw what was going on and didn't know what the hell to do. we never discussed it but because things were so awkward at dinner, i'm pretty sure my mom knew that i realized it happened as well.
6943	23706	3642	bm8dfx	emuqp3w	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i was interviewing for a big promotion at my old job. i had put in the time, the hours, and the effort for this promotion, and i had been passed up a few times, so i was sending out resumes while trying to get this promotion. i go through the first interview, and everything seemed great. they invited me for the second interview. i was so excited. flash forward two days, and i go in for the interview. the interview is with the regional and site managers. everything is going great, they are asking me ""what are your priorities, goals, etc"" at the end, the site manager changes his posture and says, ""would you say that you're a loyal employee, nessabessa34?"" taken aback, i say, of course, i've been here almost 2 years, etcetcetc. and like a shark circling his prey, this dude turns his computer monitor around, and shows me my private facebook posts that i posted that i was in the market for a job in the same field. now, there's no way he could have seen this, as it was a friends only post. someone i work with had to have tattled on me here. he then proceeds to read them to me out loud, not only the posts about my job search, but personal posts about my health situation and questions that i didn't bring up to anybody other than personal friends. i look at the regional manager and this guy won't look me in the eyes, he is shifting, obviously uncomfortable. i tried to say that i was looking just in case this promotion didn't work out, as i am a college student paying my way through school, but he kept interrupting me and saying ""loyalty is key"" he then tells me ""we will think about it"" and points toward the door. the regional manager kind of coughs and goes to shake my hand, but by that point i was already out the door. so i said ""thanks anyways"" and then proceed to have the most uncomfortable walk back to my desk, ( i was wearing heels for the first time in like a year so i stumbled on my way out the door) with coworkers asking for the details if i got the promotion. not as uncomfortable as some of you, but this one was definitely a top for me. edit: i've had a lot of messages/comments about what happened after this. -i didn't get the job. i think the whole thing was just an ""in your face"" type deal. i went on to get a promotion in a different department. i worked there for about another year and a half, and then i moved on to work for netflix, actually. so it all worked out! that manager was unfortunately promoted to regional, but the replacement manager was much nicer and not a huge dickwad."

6945	23706	10118	bm8dfx	emv6zdy	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this poor girl walked into my lecture by mistake about halfway through. this particular professor really enjoys talking to all of his students and was super engaging even with 400+ students in his class. when the girl walked in, my professor stopped teaching, looked at the girl and asked if she was in the class. she said she was and began walking towards the front where the open seats were. this is a fairly large lecture hall and all 200 students (approx how many actually show up to class) were now forced to watch this poor girl walk towards a seat because the professor didnt continue talking and just stared at her. she got close to the front and i think the pressure of the whole room got to her and she said, actually no im not, and turned around and we all had to watch this poor girl climb back up the stairs and out of the hall. i was literally watching my worst nightmare.
6946	23706	782	bm8dfx	emviqkl	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i have a regular breakfast place that i had been frequenting on the weekends for about a good 5-6 years. one day i went into work later because of a doctors appointment, so i decided to pick up some breakfast at my regular place. i walk in and i take a look around to find a spot to sit at and i see my dad. hes sitting in a corner spot with some woman i dont recognize. he looked shocked and i decide to walk over. he stands up and gives me a kiss/hug and introduces her as a coworker. it was the most awkward introduction of my life. my dad was an ac repairman and was strictly on the road. no women in his office. i pretended like i believed him, said hello and sat down on my own. definitely one of the most awkward moments of my life that will stand out for a long time. more background: my mom and dad havent been together since before i was born however he was married to another woman when this took place. the waitresses were all my friends and a couple days later when i went for breakfast they proceeded to tell me how he met that lady there every week. i never brought it up to him and pretended it never happened. that was about 14 years ago. i still go to that breakfast place and the girls told me after that day he never came back to that restaurant. in a couple of weeks it will be 1 year since he passed. im glad i got this opportunity to think and talk about him.

6949	23706	16495	bm8dfx	emv01eu	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	one time in college, i snuck into my ra's room and hid under the blanket on his top bunk. my goal was to scare him when he came in and settled down a bit. he ended up coming in with his girlfriend and began making out with her. after a good (lifetime) couple moments, i jumped up and ran out. no saving it. &#x200b; edit: gilded platinum?! thank you so much internet friends. i've said it to a few of you but it makes me legit happy that you have gotten a laugh and a smile out of my awkward story!
6950	23706	256	bm8dfx	emv3li0	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"one time when i was like 12-13 i was hanging out with some friends at a fast food joint in town. this town had a place that housed and employed mentally-challenged individuals, so those individuals would often come to the restaurant for lunch. on this particular day, a group of them was arriving just as we were leaving. one of the guys walked up to us and said ""hey, do you wanna see my weinew?"" and whipped it right out. broad daylight, right there. we were.stunned, and then super embarrassed (being immature 12-13 year olds and all.) his caretaker was mortified, but great. he immediately took control of the situation, reprimanded the individual, apologized profusely to us, made the individual apologize, etc. so yeah, that's right up there as far as awkward situations go."
6951	23706	5218	bm8dfx	emusf4o	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"most george costanza moment of my life: i was flying back home from a business trip in ga. before we all got on the airplane, everyone noticed that we would be flying with three military k9s and their handlers. all good, point being everyone noticed them, and if they hadn't, the pilot was kind enough to point them out when he came over the intercom to give his spiel. a round of applause for our service members and their brave working dogs was given. hours later in the flight, the flight crew had turned off the lights. i needed to take a piss, and moved forward in the cabin toward the restrooms. well, one of the dogs was black and i didn't see his paw sticking into the aisle. queue the dog yelping and crying. have you ever had 150 people hate you before? it was made so much worse by the fact that i am a veteren, and i love dogs. i am the son of a veteran who was a k9 handler when he served. but, how the heck am i going to explain that to a plane load of people giving me the stink eye for being the asshole who stepped on the dog. george: ""it was a black dog jerry!"" jerry: ""and the lights were out?"" george: ""the lights were out jerry!"""
6952	23706	1741	bm8dfx	emv06ta	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my family's not super religious but, when i was about 13, they decided to go to synagogue on purim for some reason. part of purim involves reading from the book of esther, which has a part about esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on his throne in the throne room and when he sees her, he stands up and extends the golden sceptre. when the rabbi got to that part, my 13 year old brain pictured esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on the shitter and burst out laughing. no one else laughed. instead, everyone turned to stare at me and i had to explain myself to an entire room of people. we now celebrate purim in the comfort of my parents' home.
6953	23706	13111	bm8dfx	emuspqg	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"okay i already posted in this thread but i remembered something even worse. when i was in 2nd grade, my brother and i would always be picked up after school by my dad. we had a green van with a red stripe on the side. so my brother grabs my hand and storms us up to the car. he rips open the door, sits us down, buckles me in, and then says ""can we get mcdonalds on the way home?"" we both look up and there is two middle aged adults sitting in the front seat that are obviously not our family. they stare at us, we stare at them. in my little brain we've been staring at eachother for at least ten minutes at this point. my brother unbuckles me, unbuckles himself, we get out and walk away. no words were exchanged. we then checked who was in the car before getting in from that point forward. edit: i've been on reddit for 6 years and this is my highest comment by far! thank you so much for the gold and silver! you're all so nice. i've loved hearing your similar stories! i'm going to ask my brother if he remembers this lol"

6955	23706	4615	bm8dfx	emupez2	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	"i used to run a restaurant and had inherited an employee with a sleigh of mental health issues. she had massive anxiety issues and just couldn't handle the pressure of working in a restaurant. she'd break down and cry over simple mistakes if she felt she was making too many. it was extremely unfortunate, but i was terribly under-prepared to coach someone like that. one day, during down-time, the cooks were shooting the shit and recounting stories of weird ex co-workers. i opened up my yap and said: ""who was the one who kept crying every time they'd screw up?"" she was 2 ft away and literally responded with ""me."" ."

6957	23706	3401	bm8dfx	emur7nz	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i am someone who never feels awkward and doesn't get embarressed, but this moment got me good. i was doing orientation for my college. i wanted to meet the dean of my department and make a good impression. i walk in his office and he is bent over behind his desk looking for something. i introduce myself and stick my hand out to shake his hand. he sits up and he has no arms. i look at him and look at my hand and i am freaking out. it felt like my hand was out there for an eternity and i did the only thing i could think of to do. i ran my hand through my hair and tried to play it off. he never said anything and just started talking to me but i felt like i was actually going to die of embarrassment.

6967	23706	639	bm8dfx	emv5e1j	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	copied from another question i answered cos i'm too lazy to retype. i worked on a deli counter and that meant having to give customers free samples when they wanted to try a product. let me first say i can be very socially awkward sometimes and i am not a very confident person - i was about 22 years old at the time. female btw. guy in his late 40s/early 50s comes to the counter and wants to try some olives - i go to the cupboard behind the counter and get a small plastic shot glass and a cocktail stick and put some olives in and go to offer the guy the glass. he holds up both arms and shows his hands are full with bags - he then proceeds to open his mouth up, indicating he wanted me to feed him the olive. i was kind of shocked and didn't really know what to do, i wanted to avoid conflict with the customer and have him go away so i just used a cocktail stick to get an olive and held it out towards him - he then ate the olive off the stick but let his mouth close round my fingers - it was honestly one of the most disgusting things that has ever happened to me and for ages after i could still feel the wetness of his mouth on my fingers - i must have scrubbed my hands a million times

"oh shit. reading the comments, i remember my by far worst moment. i was at my aunts house for christmas meetup (my whole family from my mother's side is always there) and we were just talking about some stuff, the ""shitty life pro tips"" subreddit came into my mind, and i told her that there are some tips like ""you should drive faster when you are drunk, because driving drunk is dangerous and you get home faster"". i was laughing, she just sat there, looking at me like frozen, and then told me with her voice breaking: ""that would be funny, but did you know that one of my best friends died 2 months ago because he was driving drunk? and he was too fast."" she then started to cry. i really wanted to stop existing at that moment, trust me"

""divorce papers."" well, so much for small talk. so they take out their id's so i can jot down their info. his id was a little older and had a picture from when he was a lot younger. she looks at it and comments ""that's not the same person"". i don't think much of it as i continue to write. then she says: ""that person was nice"". i've never been so uncomfortable in my life. finished up and got them the hell out of there asap."
6975	23706	933	bm8dfx	emuvbbg	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was new to the army, i met some people in airborne school, and they invited me to go to new york city with them on leave. i had never been there before, having grown up in a small town, well south of the mason-dixon, in a family without the money or desire to travel to a place like that. of course, i jumped at the chance. the drive up there was fantastic. we all took turns driving, had all the best cd's (this was early 2000's, so cd's were a thing), and lots of snacks. it was a fun road trip. then we arrived, and as it turned out, we were going to be staying with one guy's parents. um. i had been told about all the friends we were going to see, did not expect we would be staying with the parents, much younger siblings, etc. oh, and i was the only female person on this trip also, so i got instant suspicion from the mom of the guy who coordinated the whole thing. i'm just there, like, 19 years old and wanted to see nyc on leave after learning how to jump out of airplanes, ok?? the worst part was that we were stuck there for like four days, staying at this guy's parents' house, and they would have huge arguments, some of which were about why he brought me there, and i really wanted it to be over after about the first couple hours. it was easily the most awkward experience of my life.

6991	23706	653	bm8dfx	emv3uzf	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i've told this story once before, but when i was around 10 years old i was sleeping over at my best friend juan's house. we usually stayed up really late playing and would sleep in until like 11 or 12, which i loved because i rarely got to do that at my house. at about 8 am his dad comes into the room and tells me to get dressed because he needed my help. his dad was a big drinker, so either his breath reeked of beer from last night or he had one for breakfast, either way he was a bit buzzed. he tells me he needs my help picking out a toy for juan as a surprise and we were going to drive to walmart. so we get in the car and drive down to the wal-mart which was like 10 minutes away from his house. it was a pretty awkward ride and he starts asking me questions to make small talk, like how i was like school and if i had a girlfriend yet. we get to the walmart and he takes me to the you section and asks me what toy i think juan would like. i walk around and see darth vader's tie fighter. juan and i were huge star wars fans and even went to go see empire strikes back in theaters when it was re-released, so i knew he would like it. he buys the toy and then we have another awkward car ride back. he thanks me for helping and asks me to keep it a secret. i changed into my pajamas again and tried to go back to sleep, but about 10 minutes later his dad comes in and surprises him with the toy and gives me a wink. i found out a few years later that the reason he had me go on this mission to get the toy was because he had been really drunk a couple of nights ago and hit juan and he wanted to make it up to him. as far as i know that was the only time that ever happened, but i don't really know since we lost touch after 8th grade. it was just a such a strange and awkward morning.

6996	23706	56	bm8dfx	emw0ngk	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my wife and i decided to go on a date night with my brother and sister-in-law. this was our first time really hanging out as a foursome, and i was looking forward to build the relationship, since i didnt really know my sister-in-law that well. we decided to go have dinner about an hour away. my brother drove, and we all rode together and had a nice meal. not wanting the night to end, we decided to go to a club near the restaurant. the club was not what we expected, which ended up being sort of a plus. we were definitely all out of our element and it gave us something to experience together. we were all laughing and joking around and having a good time. some stranger (female), who also was out of her element, made a passing comment to me and my brother like this is pretty interesting and my brother responded with something benign like for sure. wow. never in my life would i expect to see a single, polite response to a strangers passing comment launch the rage of a thousand burning suns, but let me tell you. it did. it was a pretty low-key place, so every head turned when my sister-in-law came charging at my brother in the middle of the place, raining down a barrage of insanity that i could barely comprehend. why dont you go sleep with that girl?, who is she? a girlfriend of yours?, whats her name? huh? whats that girls name?, etc. laced with way more profanity and vulgarity. now, afterwards it seemed clear that there were some deeper problems there. clearly some trust issues. maybe some past issues? who knows. what i do know is this. two hours. they fought in the middle of this place for two hours. they were our ride home. this was before uber, in a small town without taxis. we were an hour away from where we live and there was no one to call to come get us. it was the middle of the night. it wasnt until the establishment finally called the cops, and the police came and told her that she had to leave, that we finally left. and rode home. in silence. for an eternity-long hour. i saw my brother a few days later and he was all bruised and cut up. she drove them home from our house and my brother legit jumped out of the moving car because he couldnt listen to it anymore. that was like 10 years ago, and they are still married and i hear this is a pretty common sort of thing for them. good times.

(not real name) me: yeah what do you need? dad: what the hell is this? (holding box with cum guzzling teen porno clearly showing) me: *crickets* dying inside vision tunneling dad: well? me: its not mine i swear i have no idea dad: no father should have to catch their daughter with disgusting material like this (holding up dvd titled daddys little girl) me: immediately grabbed said box and pitched in dumpster. blacked out memory of rest of the day packing. edit: wow silver! thanks awesome stranger!

7012	23706	38	bm8dfx	emvwcp8	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was in college we used to hide in a friends bathroom when everyone was leaving the pregame. once they left wed all go back and rearrange their furniture. this time i was picked to hide in the shower while everyone left. then a chick walks in and proceeds to shart all up in the toilet. then 2 of her friends come in, one of whom sits on the edge of the bathtub, with me behind a curtain. they then opened the curtain and saw me, ran out screaming. i was fucked

7014	23706	44	bm8dfx	emw0bhu	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	when i was in the army and deployed to afghanistan we had an overnight mission to march through the mountains to this isolated village that hadn't seen a military patrol pass through in years and years. we'd gotten intel that a platoon-sized group of taliban were hiding there, so we had to go do a sweep through the village to be sure. we leave in mraps just before dark, pile out on the closest stretch of road to the village and hike the entire night. we get there maybe an hour after the sun comes up and decide to drop our packs and set up our machine gun teams before going into the village, in case there are actually bad guys there and shit goes down. i go to sit down for a minute after dropping my pack and the second i plop down my pants rip all the way from my right knee up almost to my belt. i didn't wear underwear on patrol because it always bunched up, got soaked in sweat and chaffed me like crazy. so now my dick and balls are just hanging completely out in the open as we patrol through this mountain village. the first americans they've seen since the initial invasion back in 2001 and i'm flashing my junk to everyone while their kids are running around. turns out the intel had been complete bullshit and we went out there for no reason, to boot. which was kind of evident when the first guy whose house my fireteam stopped outside of offered us tea despite my balls hanging out right in front of him.
7015	23706	113	bm8dfx	emuzpp2	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	this was like 7 years ago. we were dancing at my summer camp and i had very loose shorts on. i tried to do the worm and failed miserably, everyone laughed at me. i grunted then i charged at 30 people thinking i was john wick and my pants fell down.
7016	23706	34	bm8dfx	emvh71e	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	yesterday, one of my classmates went to high five one of our fellow students, who is blind. she just walked up to him and held her hand out for an awkwardly long amount of time, before taking her hand back and saying, ill high five myself then. the other student then realised what had happened and he said, i cant see. im blind. everyone was kind of dumbfounded that she: a) hadnt picked up that hes blind (he uses a stick to get around, has been featured in the schools newsletter, and also has a seeing eye dog) and b) just walked up and expected a high five without knowing or speaking to the guy first. watching, we honestly had no idea what to do. like, do you slap her hand down and tell her hes blind? were we supposed to tell her hes blind or were we supposed to let him say something? it was so awkward, but i still chuckle when i think about it because part of me is evil and it seemed like something out of a comedy movie.

7018	23706	34	bm8dfx	emvn99k	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	my parents and i walked into an open house. they had a sign out front and even a sign in the house telling you to take your shoes off before entering. we slowly wonder why no one is inside. the owner finally sees us and gets startled. the open house was for the day after. we were casually walking in some person's house. so embarrassing.
7019	23706	36	bm8dfx	emw2ur0	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i started getting erections really young, like 10 years old or so. as a kid i thought nothing of it, i didn't even know what erections were so i assumed it was standard procedure. on weekends my morning routine was pretty standard, i'd wake up around 730, and head into the kitchen to eat breakfast with my mom and my brother. around the same time as my newfound morning erections started happening, we also happened to adopt a dog that my mom's coworker didn't have the time to properly care for. he was a pretty chill dog, a black lab/chow mix, he was only 6 months when we got him. one sunday morning i walked out into the kitchen in my pajamas, which were essentially a pair of insulated underwear since it gets cold af in the midwest. i'm sporting some pretty vicious morning wood, and my brother instantly starts cracking up, he's 5 years older than me. my mom is trying to hold back laughter while simultaneously trying to get my brother to stop teasing me. i'm standing there confused and sleepy, when this fucking dog walks right up to me, sniffs my cock, and chomps down like it was a fucking sausage link we dropped on accident. i spent the next few hours in the doctor's office, with some stranger examining my package and reassuring my mother that morning wood is totally normal for boys my age. i had never been so embarrassed in my life.
7020	23706	474	bm8dfx	emuq7p3	what's the most awkward situation you've ever been in?	i was hitchhiking across the us. which is awkward enough. some guy picked me up and half way through about a 20 minute drive down the road he decided to start talking about religion. okay cool, happens enough, most people try to convert you and such while hitching. this guy took another route by telling me about how everyone thinks islam is a religion of violence and what have you. no, he wanted me to know it was a religion of peace. by yelling it to me at the top of his lungs for 10 minutes.
