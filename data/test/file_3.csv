7423	21751	511	bmhwr8	emwp49m	gamers of reddit, if you could remaster any game so it had today's graphics, which game would you choose?	fallout 2 on 4's engine, morrowind, or star fox 64 e. no doubt fo4's engine wasn't great, but a solid fps remaster would still be a lot of fun.
7424	21751	21	bmhwr8	emxk7vo	gamers of reddit, if you could remaster any game so it had today's graphics, which game would you choose?	"fallout 3. why? it's quite simple. i'm german. when fallout 3 was released, our government had several massive sticks up their collective asses about ""killerspiele"" ruining our children with all of the violence. as such, fallout 3 was censored before the german release. unlike literally every other censored german release ever, they somehow decided ""hey if this is just going to be released on the german market, obviously every single buyer will be happy with german voices and text"". so fallout 3 is 100% german, and i can't even fix it, because technically speaking i don't own the english voice files, so downloading them separately would count as piracy. new vegas had the same problem, but when it got rereleased as a goty edition, it was fixed. fallout 3 just needs a re-release and i can finally enjoy it properly!"

7434	21751	169	bmhwr8	emx04w4	gamers of reddit, if you could remaster any game so it had today's graphics, which game would you choose?	two games come to mind: 1. star wars battlefront ii. the original from 2005. change nothing but the graphics and remaster the audio. fix the bugs. add some new maps and classes. alter none of the physics engine because the game handled like a dream. jedi combat was absurdly great and that game is lightyears better than the newer version. 2. perfect dark. goldeneye was great, but perfect dark challenges were so hard and great. the weapons, like the farsight, were way more fun than anything in goldeneye.
