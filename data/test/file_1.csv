1627	48921	7585	bsg50t	eonilqe	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	you can only do this once in a while, but when you need a break for a bit you could use http://fakeupdate.net/ to throw up a fake update screen. that's an excuse to do some other stuff like be on your phone or whatever. just seriously don't overdo it. edit: this is my most upvoted comment ever now. rip website. i'll add another one that is nice. https://pcottle.github.io/msoutlookit/ allows you to browse reddit but makes it look like some generic email service. be careful with that as well though.

1644	48921	25318	bsg50t	eon8dru	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	"teach yourself to do crazy stuff in excel! i taught myself how to do crazy stuff in excel. my last job was in purchasing and we used a lot of spreadsheets. i started out learning formulas to do things quicker. then i moved to more in-depth formulas like vlookup, then index-match. i would just look at a process that i was doing in excel, wonder if it could be done quicker or automatically, then google how to do it. eventually this lead to automating things in excel using vba. i have literally no background in technology but it wasn't hard to figure out! before i left that job, i had multiple reports in excel that would open themselves up at scheduled points in the day, update themselves, then email themselves to the correct people. i'm an attorney now, but i run my day through a schedule i made in excel. it has all my cases and times/dates. it has a data entry form that i can use to quickly update the schedule or add to it. if i click on the cell with the opposing counsel's name, it brings up their full contact info plus an option to draft an email to them. the email auto fills the subject line with the case number and defendant's name, automatically has my signature, and starts the email off with ""(attorney name),"". when i add a new case, the schedule creates a new folder for it in a designated location and autofills that folder with templates of word documents that i use for notes and trial prep. if i click on the cell with the next hearing's date, it pulls up a little calendar with that date circled and tells me how many work days i have to prepare. it also tracks how my cases are resolved. i'm working on that today, actually. the goal is to be able to click a button and get a report that breaks down cases by outcome, judge, opposing attorney, and crime. then i can use it to look for places i need improvement. edit: to clear up some confusion, we do have case management software and i do use it religiously. but when i started, i was bouncing between that software, physical calendars, emailed calendars in excel, physical notes on legal pads/sticky notes, business cards, etc. etc. it was a pain in the ass, so i made this as a kind of hub to keep me organized. it basically shows me what cases need worked on in the management software and when that work needs done. and it organizes it all in chronological order while giving me a centralized area that has quick access to things like my notes or contact information. as far as learning how to do things in excel, i found that you will almost always learn more and retain information better if you have a goal in mind. if you go into this wanting to learn how to automate a weekly sales forecast, it will be so much easier than if you go in just wanting to know more about excel in general. i'm trying to reply to comments and questions, but there are a lot! i'm not great at explaining how things work, because i'm still learning. but seriously, if i can figure this out, anyone can."
1645	48921	15112	bsg50t	eon5xml	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	i drink a lot of water. i walk to the water cooler constantly and to the bathroom just as often. the best part - it's good for you!

1647	48921	6615	bsg50t	eon1ya7	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	get good at chess (three or more days per move so you can walk away from the app). the rules never change, and tactics puzzles are the way to go. listen to great literature/minds. most (if not all) public domain books are posted on youtube. listen at 2x speed for bonus points. find new music. spotify's radio feature is great for this because it allows you to find tracks by similar artists, songs, albums, etc. practice meditation. concentration and mindfulness are skills that need to be actively developed. learn new skills. youtube is indispensable for learning coding, new languages, and anything under the sun. start with things you imagined would be interesting as a kid. better yourself. you spend most of your waking life at work, and you'll never achieve happiness by twiddling your thumbs. when all else fails, browse reddit. edit: hi reddit! just wanted to say that life is good! don't get lost in the trip.
1648	48921	3505	bsg50t	eon3yua	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	"**send inflammatory emails to addresses picked at random from the company directory.** will it be a superior? a subordinate? that suspicious-looking guy with the nervous tic whom everyone suspected of bringing a hooker to the holiday party? what repercussions could you expect? will deborah file another sexual harassment lawsuit? will dan go on another breakroom bender? will you be fired for inappropriate behavior? *promoted* for being ""just the right amount of crazy?"" regardless of what happens, you'll be in for an adventure. and what's more, you'll get some exercise out of it, too! granted, it won't do much if you're trying to bulk up, but it's a *great* way to get your heart going!"

1653	48921	429	bsg50t	eonm5gy	what's the best way to pass the time at a boring desk job?	i got good at my job and was lucky enough to have a wall behind my desk. so i just got 95% of my work done in the first hour and then browsed reddit/watched youtube whilst doing the last 5% over the course of the day when someone was nearby. i eventually realised i was wasting my life, quit my job, and moved to the other side of the planet to become an english teacher. fuck desk jobs.
