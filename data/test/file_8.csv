5810	30729	2313	blna2q	emqmxqo	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my high school gf worked there way back in the day. she said the worst part of the day was having to collect merchandise from the fitting rooms and cleaning the fitting rooms. apparently, all sorts of nasty women would go in there and try on the panties, not use a liner and just generally leave them all crusty and bad smelling. they would also leave pads and tampons all over. she said they had to throw away so much merchandise that was left in that condition. i feel like this may be a problem anywhere they sell clothes but then again hot topic may attract a different type of customer so it might have happened more often?
5811	30729	773	blna2q	emqtabw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at a hot topic in '99-'00. we used to get a fair amount of strippers that came in because we were the only place around that sold see-through vinyl bikini tops and 6 inch stack boots and shit like that. anyway, our fitting room was basically a hole cut in a wall with a mirror and a thick curtain that had to be pulled close just right. this one day, a stripper came in to try on a bunch of stuff and really didn't even bother with the curtain. apparently, she was so used to people seeing her naked that it wasn't a big deal for her. granted, this was a weekday morning and she and her boyfriend/manager/bodyguard or whatever were the only people in the store besides my manager and me. at one point she just stopped using the fitting room altogether and was just using the full length mirror on the door to the stockroom/office. my manager and i really had no idea what to do, because at this point she's got about $1500-$2000 worth of merchandise that she's probably buying, and this lady is good for both business *and* morale. she didn't seem to be worried at the prospect of anyone seeing her, and the way our store was set up was really narrow and long, and the display fixtures were tall and bulky. it was very difficult to see into and out of the store unless you were standing in the center aisle. it made loss prevention a nightmare, but really allowed this lady to let her freak flag fly. she finally puts her clothes on at the cash wrap as she's checking out. my manager gave me so much shit after that because i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact with the customer while i rang her up. that was the largest transaction i ever rang up in my time there, and paid for it with the largest wad of cash i'd ever seen in my life up to that point. **tl;dr a stripper came in on a slow day and treated the store like her own private dressing room.**
5812	30729	1935	blna2q	emqsb8s	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at hot topic about 8 years ago. for the most part, the gig was the best part-time job i ever had. great managers, great coworkers, great customers. only 2 instances stand out in my mind. 1. this was around when twilight was big. middle-aged women would come in and ask where the edward/jacob merch was and then just start fawning over them in the most uncomfortable way. 2. my actual interview. it was a group interview. one of the questions was something about either a difficult customer service moment or something. this one guy (obvious ht scene type) proudly talks about the time he worked at a bookstore and sucker-punched a female customer in the face for calling his style weird/freaky/something. i never saw that guy again so i dont think he got the job.
5813	30729	5258	blna2q	emqlur6	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"i worked for 2 years at my local hot topic and the worst stories both involved the fitting room. our fitting room used to be a self-service room in the back of the store with a red curtain in front of it. an employee noticed 4 feet in the room and opened it to find two people having sex in it and had to clean up the remnants. a second incident came when a smell wafted from the same room. it was later discovered that someone had actually taken a dump in the room when they went in to ""try on clothes"". we ended up fitted the room with a galvanized piece of chain and a masterlock to keep the curtain open. luckily, shortly thereafter, we got a full store overhaul that put in actual fitting rooms."
5814	30729	6258	blna2q	emqlm8l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my current boss was a former store manager at a hot topic and he told me that he caught one of his employees stealing a shirt he had stuffed into a sonic cup. from then on out everyone had to check bags and beverages for merchandise.
5815	30729	6705	blna2q	emqn6an	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	a petite friend is currently a manager at one and her issue is always a customer that become too-often repeat customer obsessed with her or another female employee. currently it's a guy that swears they would have everything in common because he likes all the things in the store too, as if she curated it, and now has to stay 500 feet from the store.
5816	30729	11265	blna2q	emqmbsn	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a horror story but a ridiculous short one. i had a woman come in with her sleeping infant and screamed at me to turn off the music while she strolled around the store. i mean if your baby is sleeping and you want them to continue, maybe dont come to browse the store that you can hear music blasting from the other side of the mall, idk what to tell ya haha.
5817	30729	1044	blna2q	emqt8cz	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	thursday is actually my last day with hot topic after 4 years! in general the company is amazing to its employees and ive met some incredible people. but boy do i have stories!! 1. i once found a condom on our anime section. it was open and filled with.something. 2. we had a girl who i am positive had some mental issue because she would get into the fitting room and try to lure anyone in there to help her then try and seduce them. she was actually pretty but young and filled to the brim with crazy. 3. alice cooper came into the store once. totally unannounced and brought a teacup pig. absolutely wonderful person. gave our metalhead associate tickets to his show and this dude about lost it. 4. also met machine gun kelly, mayday parade, we the kings, and max green of escape the fate. mgk and the vocalist for wtk were assholes. 5. we had a guy get thrown against the front gate on the morning of a funko pop release. in general the job has taught me some pop collectors are grads a assholes. 6. had a woman ask me if she should go back to stripping after her c section, then lifted her shirt to show me the scar and her tits. 7. we found out there was a group of mallrats who wrote fan fiction about the staff at our store. i never got to see any and im glad for that.
5818	30729	2594	blna2q	emqofea	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was working on the sales floor and this guyat least in his 30s and pretty highstarts making sexual comments to me about this 15ish girl that was checking out. i asked him to leave and nothing more came of it but ich it was chilling. also had a co-worker get fired because they were selling weed out of the back room. shed sneak it into their bag while they were checking out. also had a different, off-duty, co-worker come in hammered late one night to tell everyone working how great we were. that was actually kinda nice. besides that, it was a lot of kicking out vaping teenagers and letting the quiet girls from my school try on skimpy harley quinn bikinis in the dressing room. edit:grammar
5819	30729	15062	blna2q	emql2r3	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked there for 13 years. soooo much weird, but that's just retail in general. caught a guy masturbating into women's shoes in the dressing room. people had sex in there more often than you'd be comfortable with. i worked for them when columbine happened. we carried a brand of clothing back then called serial killer, which featured pop culture pics/references and some edgy saying, like a pic of bruce lee that said ""revenge"" or something like that. the morning after columbine happened, we got an email to pull all the serial killer clothing line off the sales floor, as well as every trenchcoat in the store. by the end of the day i'd already had to call security twice due to people showing up at the store and harassing me for 'supporting those psychos' and 'training the next ones'. then the tv networks showed up and pretty much camped the front of our store, harassing every customer as they walked in/out, asking them why this 'dark lifestyle' attracted them. the mall ended up having security just hang out in front of our store and walking our employees to their cars for a week afterward. honestly, it was the best job i ever had. the company was really supportive at the corporate level. i still have friends that work there. they pretty much left me alone so long as i made sales, so i had carte blanche to set up my stores the way i wanted even if it didn't look like the planned merchandising setups they sent out. i had direct access with every dept, so if i felt my stores couldn't sell something they sent us, they'd let me transfer it somewhere else, and vice versa, get more best sellers in. honestly, if it wasn't for the working every weekend and closing a lot stuff, i would have continued working there."
5820	30729	4211	blna2q	emqku1l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee. i worked a whole 3 months in summer, so all the kids were out and about. i was stocking disney merchandise and i couldn't help but notice a kid underneath one of our clearance racks. i heard some strange noise coming from there too so i crouch under and look at the kid. he had a button, needle and all, in his mouth. i asked him where his parents were and before i knew it he swallowed the pin and ran out of the store. i couldn't leave and go search for the child so i let security know about the button kid. never knew what happened after that. i can't seem to forget button kid though.
5821	30729	5353	blna2q	emqprnc	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"spent almost 5 years working at one in the early 2000's. being in the midwest, we had a ton of juggalos but they were actually pretty nice people in general. i had a group of kids ask what i would do if they ""set some clothes on fire"" and flicked a lighter multiple times. we mostly got weirdos who wanted to bang in the dressing room or lifted up their shirts to ask me what gauge their nipple ring is. we had this one girl who came in weekly and i dont think she was all there. she would sit at the listening station for way too long and then leave. one day she sat down and put the headphones on. she had a plastic bag with her filled with empty glass bottles and peaches (yes, the fruit). we noticed it was leaking onto the floor but just let her do her thing. she put the headphones back and looked at her leaking bag. she had a mildly disappointed look on her face but immediately looked at her watch and yelled ""i'm going to miss my bus!"". she ran out of the store and up to a trash can outside the store. she held the bag up high and yelled ""peaches meet your fate!!!"", threw the bag in the trash, and sprinted off. that job was weird."
5822	30729	5277	blna2q	emqfs4l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee of a couple years in high school. i loved that job. the biggest horror story that sticks out in my mind was this guy that would always come in with his kids. he was a huge icp fan, and from the looks of it, he let his kids (both boys, they were i'd guess maybe 7 and 8 at the time) listen as well. they always had hatchet man stuff on and pretty bitchin' haircuts. they always misbehaved, just running around the store screaming, sometimes crashing into stuff, and the dad gave no fucks. he was often pretty rude to us in the store about not having specific merch or being out of stuff in his size (he was a large guy.) i had and still have no business in what that guy does with his kids, but i always felt a little bad that there was a good chance they would end up in a bad way. other than that reoccurring instance, for the most part our store was really fun.
5823	30729	6882	blna2q	emqjxie	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked for hot topic for about 7 years. my store was apparently the juggalo store of the district, and i think the state. working for that company as long as i did, i was pretty used to ignoring people's crappy taste, but the juggalos were different. this is in central florida, so it's on average about 90 degrees most days and always humid as hell. these kids were always very overweight, wearing a massive black icp tee, those ridiculous 30 pound black tripp pants with huge pockets and all the hardware (chains and straps) hanging from them, and they were drenched in sweat (their hygiene was almost always awful). they always seemed to show whenever a new icp shirt or collectible would arrive, and would smell up the store and pay in wadded up, sweat soaked money. it was just all around unpleasant. the smell would linger for a bit after they left. it was not pleasant.

5825	30729	13148	blna2q	emqif06	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this is my time to shine. i was helping a lady at the disney section. she was pretty particular about the things she wanted and was asking if they looked okay enough for her. being my first job i was really enthusiastic about being a sales person and i really do love disney. so i was hyping her up the best i could and were laughing together, getting along really well. then she says, yeah i wanted to get all the same things my boyfriends baby mama has, is that weird? literally did not know how to respond. i said it wasnt and cashed her out quick.
5826	30729	15765	blna2q	emqk09k	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this was my first job in my college town, and generally, i absolutely loved it. youre treated like some super cool mini-celebrity by all the little mall rats, the management was generally great to their employees, and the work wasnt too hard in my small, low volume store. however, there was the issue of valentines day. that year they were promoting all these different corsets and lingerie, as well as the get in our pants campaign for the skinny jeans. management wanted the employees to try and show the corsets not just as lingerie, but as fashion items, maybe paired with the skinny jeans. increase sales and all. so there i am, valentines day, in a black corset and tight black skinny jeans and boots. waaay more sexy than 18-year old me with a still-developing body was comfortable with. in comes creepy mccreeper, a 50+ something dude who says he wants to buy something for his wife, but wants some help picking it out. not once did his eyes look at my face. the entire time im helping him, hes staring at my ass or chest and making weird comments about how i remind him of his daughter, or being uncomfortably comfortable telling me explicit details about his wifes body. he then asks me to try it on and show him, so he could see how it would look on his wife. luckily, shy 18-year old me awkwardly laughed it off and got him past the register and out of the store. i loved that job but jesus, did it draw some weirdos.
5827	30729	5620	blna2q	emqk0wq	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"maybe not so much horror, but just terribly annoying/cringy. 1. i was wearing a hellblazer shirt that had a cover of the new 52 revamp on it. i had two neckbeards come up and start trying to gatekeep me on if i was ""really"" a fan of hellblazer/john constantine. it included the actual questions of ""well, what's your favorite arc?"" ""who is your favorite writer/artist?"" 2. halloween is coming up. it's the halloween season after suicide squad came out, so we have both versions of the joker's outfits (the other from the dark knight). both versions were unreasonably expensive. in total for the dark knight costume, if i remember correctly was about $200 all together. because you had to buy the coat, the undershirt, the pants etc. the fabric of the costume was just a little bit better quality then the $50 version you get at any halloween setup store. we had a guy come in about 30 minutes before we closed for the night and wanted to try on the dark knight version of the joker's outfit. the costume was hanging up on the tallest rack so it required me getting a pole and pulling down each one because the size he needed was a large and each component of the costume. he tried it on, enjoyed it, and wanted to buy it. i went ahead to go ring him up and then when he saw the price of it he started flipping out. he started complaining that he could find this costume in anywhere else that he wanted at a cheaper price. he wanted to know if there's any coupons or if i could give him my employee discount. i told him there's no way i could do that. he starts flipping out and says he needs his costume tomorrow and he doesn't have that money now. he took me about 45 minutes after closing to finally leave. he did not buy the costume. even before suicide squad came out working halloween around hot topic was always cringey with all the joker and harley quinn people. edited to correct minor errors - was using speech to text to tell the story while feeding the baby. sorry!"
5828	30729	10291	blna2q	emqhkvb	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	finally one of these where i have an actual personal story. i worked at one for about a year. you would see a lot of cringy stuff just because of the base it attracts, but nothing terrible horrible usually besides one time. i was working a saturday afternoon shift, it was about 3:30 pm and the store wasnt busy at all. there were only two weaboo looking guys in their 20s in the store. then, a group of four teens walked in giggling and looking suspicious. they go up to the weaboos and start singing the nyan cat song nyannyanyannyanyannyanyanyannyanyanyan!!!! me and my coworker are like what the fuck. one of the weaboos gets aggressive and is like step the fuck back! step the fuck back! he then fucking grabs a chain wallet and starts swinging it at them. i call security and my coworker is just screaming hey hey hey!!! trying to stop it. one of the kids calls the weaboos fat asses as hes still trying to hit them with the wallet, and responds to their insult by calling them daddys cum stain bitch asses. by now 3 security guards come in and break it up, while the silent weaboo is saying the kids started it. both parties are escorted out different exits while we give a report on what happened. never saw any of them again.
5829	30729	5207	blna2q	emqdlee	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this would also be a good question for spencer's employees since they're very similar but more adult oriented
5830	30729	9359	blna2q	emq6tyt	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my sister worked at one for a little while. one day two grown men were fighting over a pop (it's like a collectible figure). like a legit fight. she said it was like the comic book guy from the simpsons fighting another comic book guy from the simpsons. my sister called mall security and noped the hell out of their way. neither one of them got the pop. my sister had to put all the stuff back that they knocked over.
5831	30729	170	blna2q	emqsqk7	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked at one seasonally for about 6 years through high school and college. absolutely loved working there. we had a customer come in who claimed he was a vampire. he dressed like an extra from interview with the vampire on a tight budget and went out of his way to insist that he was truly a vampire. he would occasionally corner employees to berate them about this. it happened to me while i was helping him find a new pair of boots. he cornered me by the changing rooms, told me all about the women he enthralls, and spoke in metaphors at me for about 15 minutes. i tried to be as polite as possible and feigned interest, but eventually he must have noticed i wasn't falling prey to his glamor so he switched to complaining about how he has two different sized feet and finding footwear is hard. outside of customers, we once had an absolute idiot as a manager. dude would come in and fall asleep on the tables in the stock room, or spend hours at a time in the bathroom and have us tell anyone looking for him that he's on a conference call. he'd also occasionally try to find ways to get mos'd merch out to his car. once, back when we had a cd changer for the in-store music, he brought in a bunch of cds from his car to play. one was blink-182's take off your pants and jacket. none of the album's he brought in we're censored, which we didn't actually think about until the intro the the bonus track ""fuck a dog"" came on. the store was pretty full, we both panicked, and i ended up jumping over the counter to get to the cd changer in time to hit skip. my toe caught the counter on my way over, throwing me off balance and causing me to drill my other foot toes-first into the floor. still skipped before anyone knew what was playing, though. edit: typo"
5832	30729	993	blna2q	emqnpku	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	well i worked at the pac sun two stores down but knew the ht people pretty well as they were the only ones who also smoked cigarettes; if either were out of smokes we could get one from the other. hung out with the manager a few times at his place to smoke out etc. he was super into coheed and cambria and we'd jam out to that. had a wife and kid who were super nice and cooked dinner for me when i was there. end up moving and on a trip back home, i stop in to see if anyone i knew was still there. ask about manager dude and the person's face just drops. turns out dude was in prison for fucking a 14yo.
5833	30729	7843	blna2q	emqgoao	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"former ht store manager here. at the height of the twilight craze, and when i was still a sales associate, we had a midnight release party for the first movie's dvd. people legitimately camped out in the mall to be at this event. generic twilight fans: 12-16 year old girls, their mothers, and the odd sprinkling of adults that were wildly out of place. employees were encouraged to dress up in twi merch, but me being 17 and engrossed in the suburban punk rock lifestyle, i did not participate. my sm was not pleased about this, so she mos'd (marked out of stock) an outfit for me. girls size small ""i  boys who sparkle"" tee that rode up like a crop top, the tightest jeans i've ever worn, and to top it all off, she aggressively applied eyeliner, sparkly eye shadow, and body glitter all over me. and before anyone asks or makes the whole process into something sexy, she was in her mid forties, overweight, and generally the most unpleasant person ever. it was humiliating, but the only saving grace is that i got so. many. phone. numbers that night. i was drowning in high school girls who thought i was amazing. nothing ever came from it though. i've got other stories, but i'm headed into my adult job now. if i remember, l will post a few more tonight. edit: rip my inbox. also, for clarity's sake, i am a dude."
5834	30729	452	blna2q	emqpuyt	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i didn't work there very long, but i remember on my second day of the job a lady came in looking for something to buy her daughter. told me she was a fan of janis joplin, jimi hendrix, that kind of stuff. so i walked around with her for maybe an hour showing her all sorts of things she might like (this was back when hot topic was more music oriented in the early 2000's). we picked out a few really awesome things i thought she might like.and then the mom spotted a marilyn manson mini skirt. after hearing how her daughter dressed and what kind of music she listened to for upwards of an hour, i tried to tell the mom that her daughter probably wouldn't like that skirt. but she insisted and ended up getting only the skirt. it was my first retail job. something inside me died a little that day.
5835	30729	19882	blna2q	emq5wtp	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was there for 4 years, so ill have to think about this for a bit. first story that comes to mind was my first halloween. corporate sent out calendars that were only on the shelf for maybe 3 hours. each month was a different serial killer. it had a picture, stats and sayings from each one. for instance, one month (june i believe) was ed gein. it had his kill count listed, and then basic bullet point facts about him. this was the first and only time i ever saw corporate had us field destroy merchandise. to this day i wish i had kept a copy. edit: it was 2007. i was only part time and i had only been there a few months. had i known how cool it wouldve been i wouldve taken one. or five. i had planned on buying one the second we unboxed them. thanks for all the likes!

"i managed 3 different hot topics in the late 90's/early 2000s. mostly i had a great time working there. i don't know that i have any horror stories, per se, but there was a lot of crazy shit that went on. in the main store i worked in, people (including staff) were constantly fucking in the changing room. teenagers would come in reeking of weed so strongly that you could smell them across the store. people were always coming in in bondage gear, on leashes, etc. which was pretty hilarious, because the store i was at was in a really suburban area. there was one guy that came for about a year, every weekend, asking about stiletto boots in a particular size that was really hard to find. finally, i managed to find a pair and got it shipped to our store. turns out they were for him. he was like maybe 5'5"" and 300lbs. probably the most memorable experiences was the time that a bunch of the raver kids (i say kids, i was like 21 at the time) convinced me to go out to a rave with them. the store manager was going (i was assistant), along with like 3 staff. the staffers were over 18, but still living at home, and at the end of they were too high to go home. so the manager (also still rolling) decided we could all just crash in the back of the store, since we had a bunch of bean bag chairs back there. ended up with lots of oral sex being exchanged."
5839	30729	5737	blna2q	emqe8zu	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	didnt work there but i can bet your butt a hot topic employee cringed and laughed at me. when i was 10ish, i really loved to write. i was also going through that edgy phase (i think avril lavigne was getting big right around then). i was looking around the store, not really knowing what half the stuff was. they always had awesome bumper stickers, and i picked one up that said inkaholic. because i liked to write, you know, with ink. and i told the cashier as much when he asked me what the sticker meant. that was one of those things that i completely forgot about until several years later when it randomly popped in my head, and i realized how wrong i was. i hope he got a good laugh over me.

"we had a regular we called ""body pillow kid"" because he would always ask if we sold waifu body pillows. he usually came in with his dad who was a huge gross nasty pervert. something was clearly up with bpk mentally but his dad's behavior was just totally over the line unacceptable. they never bought anything and just came in to harass our staff. it was a bunch of ""i'm not paid enough to deal with this bullshit"" fuckery. list of things body pillow kid and his dad did to me while i was working there: 1: tell me they would pay me to ""just exist"" in swimwear at their house 2: show me a sketch book made up of self drawn hentai 3: made me get up on a ladder because they ""wanted one of the pop's at the top"" only for me to grab one, come down, and them tell me they just wanted to ""look at my ass at eye level"" 4: stalked me out of the store to my car 5: cornered me in the cash wrap while i was alone in the store so i couldn't get away from them 6: told two of my associates ""lesbians are nasty but if you wanted to make out for us we wouldn't complain"" or something along those lines 7: said to me ""i'd like to choke you like a bitch, doll face"" we eventually had to go off and beg our store manager to ban them. she didn't (and made it clear we weren't allowed to) but we eventually were so cold and ignored the dad so much that they stopped showing up. i regularly had to call my store manager or security about them and felt so unsafe/gross at our store. gotta love a store manager who would risk the safety of her team for a potential sale! :d i worked there for over 2 years and every moment seemed like an absolute horror fest. i probably have a million stories. met my best friend there so i guess i can't be too upset. :/"
5848	30729	232	blna2q	emqne6b	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at hot topic for 2 years as a manager. the worst we would get were bored stay at home moms with their bratty children. this one particular mom came in with her twins. they wreaked havoc in my store, pulled tees out of the baskets, make up out of the displays. anything they could get their hands on the pulled out and left on the ground. the mom was off in her own little world. she didn't even buy anything. i was the only employee in the store that morning. edit: spelling

5852	30729	354	blna2q	emqqam9	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh buddy. i have 8 years of stories that i can tell. mostly, the job was great. i loved most of my customers and my employees. my managers would vary on the years. one customer liked to get too friendly with the girls (most of which were under 18 and he was nearing 50) and id have to send them to the back so he wouldnt try to touch them. another guy that was known to be a shoplifter around the mall came in one day and stole from me. one of my cool customers chased after him and didnt get the stuff back, but did yell at security at being awful. i also got into yelling matches with the lazy mall security because they wouldnt do shit about this guy because they didnt see him steal. even though everyone else did. my first district manager was flat out cruel. when she left the company and came to the store to shop, i started having an anxiety attack because the backroom was a mess (it was the holiday, we were understaffed) and i thought she would write me up for it. i had men tell me about their jacobs ladder piercings and had them ask if i could size that jewelry which i quickly shot down. there was one guy who smelled so bad that wed have to febreeze the store after he left and it would still smell like death. there are so many more. people fighting on black friday, women telling me i had child bearing hips and i should have kids already. and the one time some lady came in to return a christmas gift for her daughter and i asked if her kid would like something else. her response? my daughter passed away on christmas. which was heartbreaking.
5853	30729	1239	blna2q	emqmhfh	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was a horrible customer there. i was shitty insecure teenager and i tried every fucking dress in there. i cried a lot. i ended up buying nothing, so a poor employee just wasted a whole afternoon on my mental breakdown. if i go back to the states (the store was near calabasas i think) im gonna bring this guy a chocolate or something. he really had the patience of a saint. so, said employee, if you remember a crying, scared girl from chile, who cried over plaid dresses, im really sorry and you deserve a raise

"i worked there for over two years. was the the stock guy dealing with all the new product my store had. 1. we had a chase funko pop come out and unfortunately i didn't get to till way later, late enough that the person first in line left. and everyone moved up in the line. when i got to said funko pops and put them out, i heard a lot of angry words, swears and a threat on my life. since he didn't get the funko pop and left the line, there was no way for him to get a chase pop. so he started threatening me and my store. 2. when we got new shipment, it was my job to process it and put it out on the floor. i opened this box up and out popped a tekashi 69 shirt. i immediately emailed my dm, corporate, and our company guy that deals with shirts. literally saying, ""because of what this man has done, i don't feel comfortable putting them out, they'll be locked up till you tell me otherwise."" in the next 3 days, we got an email to destroy and discard them after ""a lot of employees brought it to our attention that tekashi 69 isn't someone we should support at hot topic"" i have more if yall want them. fucking retail."

(these were snakebites.) so i told them i couldn't know for sure, but generally they're the smallest size we carry. things were pretty normal, getting them out of the case, the transaction, whatever. then she asks me to change them for her daughter. she was around 16 or so, quiet girl who seemed pretty embarassed by her mother. i had to explain how it was unsanitary for me to basically stick my fingers in her daughter's mouth to change them for her. she flipped out and wanted a refund. technically, since the package hadn't been opened/left the store, i got management approval to refund her. manager walks away after approving it, i put my hand out to grab the pack of piercings. this lady opens the pack and tells her daughter to switch out the rings she had in her mouth with the brand new ones, telling me, ""you can just clean and resell these. it's not a big deal."" &#x200b; lady could no longer get her refund. security had to be called."

5861	30729	214	blna2q	emqq9wa	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh man its my time to shine. i worked at hot topic for 4 years, so i have several. 1. this one happened when they first released their jean brand. they had sent us all sorts of signage for the promo sale and were holding a store contest among the districts for who could sell the most jeans for the month, i dont remember what the prize was but my manager was really determined to win so he made it so we all had to wear the jeans during our shift, ok fine not a problem, the catch was he picked them out and he always chose super skinny tight ones (all of us employees were underage girls, oldest being 18) and on top of that he made stickers and buttons for the promotion on his own dime, that said : ask me how to get into my pants! :| you can imagine how that turned out. 2. had a chick straight up take a shit in the dressing room. our store is one of the smallest, and theres never a point at which someone could be out of your sight and there was only one dressing room so i knew exactly who did it. i let her in to try on halloween costumes and noticed she didnt bring anything out with her, so as per protocol i went in to see if the merchandise was in there and i walked into a huge pile of shit smeared all over the merchandise and mirror/walls. it was fucking gross. my manager tried to make me clean it up. we couldnt even really do anything about it either. we asked her about it and she insisted she didnt do it. 3. a couple and their baby came in one day, it was a busy day, but i recognized the chick because she was a well known local stripper who would frequently come in an hour before closing and spend hundreds of dollars on random shit while she was strung out and then try to return it- clearly worn and used- a few days later. anyways this time, she was there with her boyfriend (im assuming) and they were walking around arguing and fighting about something. she ended up leaving and shortly after he followed. not too long after that the store is empty and i start hearing a baby. sure enough, these people left their infant in his car seat on the damn floor. we called the police obviously, but they returned not long after that for the baby.
5862	30729	2387	blna2q	emq69k3	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i modelled for them a while ago. all i remember is the food at the canteen in the headquarters was super good. and also they had beers and candy on fridays which made me wish i was part of the crew. the modelling however was kind of cringe, i didnt really want anyone to see me in wonder woman garb. but the rates were good and i wanted to make money to pay rent.
5863	30729	751	blna2q	emqkozw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	last summer in the evening three guys came in to harass me. im a female and i was working alone because we werent expected to make enough that day to justify having more than one person working. one of the three guys who came in stood back by our jewelry thing and claimed that someone from spencers had sent them there to ask for our advice for peeing on a girl during sex. at this point the other two were laughing their asses off. and i was immensely uncomfortable but because who knows what their intentions were i had to try to be polite because the last thing i needed was for them to call corporate and make a complaint. all the while there were two other guys up by the front counter who were looking at the new pop releases for the day who watched the entire thing go down and not say anything but expressed that the situation was messed up after those three left. the whole night i was paranoid to do my bank deposit because i wasnt sure of those three would still be in the mall and i called up an old coworker of mine to walk with me. honestly i dont have a problem when customers are genuinely looking for some weird shit, but that was straight up harassment.
5864	30729	187	blna2q	emr2afj	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i actually have mostly good stories about the time i worked at ht. i took the position as an asm when i was between jobs and ended up staying almost three years. one thing i havent seen mentioned often in this thread is how many strippers shop at ht. its like a one stop shop for dancers. we sold body glitter, scented body spray, decent makeup in non traditional colors, crazy platforms and spike heels, a ton of lingerie at a relatively cheap price, accessories, body jewelry, cheap hair dye, and colored wigs/hair extensions. i absolutely could not tell you how many of my regulars were local dancers, maybe 50? lets just say whatever bank teller processed our cash deposits probably wondered why so many of the one and five dollar bills sparkled and smelled like cotton candy. the sm when i was hired was a woman, and she seemed to favor hiring other women, so most of my staff was girls. i did have a few male sales associates, and b was my favorite. he was a straight edge christian metalcore kid fresh out of high school and obsessed with girls. he was a good kid, and i would always try to schedule us together, because he was genuinely nice and great at customer service, he was a hard worker, and we would talk about girls, music, and video games while we worked. one day, these two dancers come in together, and lets just say they are on. most of the dancers who came in would be in sweats and sunglasses, carrying an iced coffee, like the exact opposite of what they were by night. super low key. not these two. they were dressed super provocatively, and when i approached to help them, they immediately made it apparent they were there to put on a little show and tease the guys at ht. girls flirt with you at ht, not constantly but waaaaay more than other traditional retail, but this was way beyond that. one of the girls asked the second if her ass was too fat to fit in the skinny jeans she had picked out, to which the second responded with some lewd remark about not wearing pants at all and slapping the first girl on the butt. they asked to get into the body jewelry case to see some pieces, which requires a key and supervision. as soon as they asked, i called for b, chucked him my keys, and told the girls, i have to go to my break, but b here will be more than happy to see to your every need, at which point i walked my ass out and sat down on the bench directly in front of our store to watch the show. i have never seen human flesh turn that shade of red in my entire life. b stood there talking to these girls with this look on his face that could only be described as panic mixed with terror doused in teenaged hormones. from my seat, i could tell the girls immediately picked up on it. they started stroking his arm while speaking to him. one of them held up some lingerie against her body and looked at him as if to ask him what he thought. i was having the time of my life. 15 minutes later, i decide to put b out of his misery and walk back in. the girls decide they have what they need and approach the register. b steps up to the register. the two of them start to do this bit where theyre fighting over who gets to pay for their purchase. each of them asks b to take their debit card. no, no, i insist! finally, b just snags the closest card and runs it. the loser of the game turns to the other girl, who just paid for their purchases, and says, well, i guess i have to thank you proper, and proceeds to shove her tongue in her friends mouth. now ive been around the block and seen some shit, but at this point even i was put back on my heels a bit. but b, his eyes were so wide he looked like a cartoon character and his mouth was wide fucking open. gathering myself, i was just about to gently ask the girls to kindly not in my family establishment when they stopped, turned to b, and blew him kisses with winks. they left and i fucking lost it. i couldnt stop laughing or grinning the rest of the night. poor b couldnt think straight the rest of the shift and just wandered around in a daze until we left for the night.
5865	30729	270	blna2q	emqq8mx	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a hot topic employee, but i am sure one or two would have a story about me and my friends in high school. i was a sophomore in high school at the peak of the scene queen movement and my friends and i partook in it all. right around this time hot topic opened up in our small town and suddenly other people had access to band merch, skinny jeans, etc. i was wandering around the store shortly after it opened with my posse and in walk some cheerleaders from our high school (our town only had one high school) and my friend loudly screams, i guess theyll just let anyone in here!. yes because hot topic is the ultra exclusive store for tru fannzzzzz.
5866	30729	62	blna2q	emr19on	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	tldr at the bottom, lmao this got way longer than i thought it would be. so theres a certain amount of dealing with creeps that i feel like most ppl go through as retail employees, but at my store we have a customer that we all know as the hot topic predator. my first interaction with the predator was very odd. he was obviously hitting on me, and i was obviously uncomfortable. he traps you there by asking you more and more personal questions and seeming very interested in your answers, so i almost felt guilty trying to pull away from the conversation. i felt like he was a nice guy, he just didnt understand boundaries, and i have a boyfriend anyways. so i survive an uncomfortable first interaction, but he kept on coming back. he was always alone, and he never bought anything. sometimes hed try to talk to me, but id just act like i was too busy with the job to chat. then he took another victim. i was helping out a really sweet girl while he was in the store, and he trapped her in the jewelry section asking really similar things that he asked me. she didnt seem uncomfortable by it, so i wasnt too worried. they talked for probably 15 mins before she left. and then literally five minutes later he starts hitting on another girl. at this point im like really grossed out, and after the second victim finally escaped i let her know he had just gotten another girls number, and she agreed with me that it was pretty douchey of him to try for two in one night. so here i am thinking this guy literally just comes in my store to find goth gfs and im like real mad about it lmao. come on dude, go find some other breeding grounds that arent you loitering around a store bothering employees and customers. but wait it gets even weirder. i got a text from a coworker saying there was a guy talking to a girl in the store for literally over an hour, and he managed to catch him name. it wasnt the name the predator had told me, so i figured it was just someone else oddly spending that much time in hot topic. then, i catch him talking to one of my female coworkers one day, and she tells me he had given her a different name too. she got really creeped out. she let me know that she had met up with him once to talk about his small business and he was basically interviewing her, asking quite personal questions and wouldnt tell her what the business was?????? so now weve gone from your average overly friendly dude, to please stop hitting on girls in my store, to this guy is definitely hiding something and i never want him stepping foot in my store again. and that was the last ive seen of the hot topic predator, but im sure hell come back, and you know damn well ill be kicking him out when he does. tldr: a customer went from annoying guy that hits on every girl in hot topic to this guys hiding something and im very worried by giving us all different names and interviewing a coworker of mine for his business, but wouldnt tell her what his business was.
5867	30729	225	blna2q	emqneov	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	one i can actually answer! i worked there for a short time over christmas as a second job to earn extra cash. hours were shit though, maybe 15 hours a week split into 3 shifts. anyways, the first one was when i was helping someone grab something off the bottom shelf. an older man and his still too old to be shopping at hot topic son were cashing out after i finished helping them. super rude, music snobs who hates everything but the classic rock shirts we sold. as i was bent over grabbing something for an older woman, the older man walks by on his way out, points to my ass and says thats what i want for christmas! while him and his 40 years old son leave laughing. i almost cried. secondly was the insane amount of girls coming in for billie eilish stuff. this was before she was super big so i didnt know who they were talking about. i got some of the worst death glares from those 15 year olds i ever have working in retail.
5868	30729	113	blna2q	emqs0kj	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes! my time to chime in! ill never forget this because it still disgusts me to this day. this chick (i went to high school with her) tried to return a tongue piercing. its against company policy not to accept piercings back if the package has been opened, for very obvious health reasons. i could tell straight from the get go that the packing had been opened and i flat out asked her have you worn these? she answered yes. and got immediately defensive when i wouldnt take them back. after calmly explaining the company policy multiple times, i finally said would you wanna wear a complete strangers used tongue piercing in your mouth?! she huffed and left and 7 years later i catch myself wondering about her one brain cell.

5870	30729	53	blna2q	emqt7lt	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	so i have too many great stories. one of my favorites is there was a time this older lady came up to me and asked excuse me sir, is there any way you could help my granddaughter get into the fitting room, shes apparently too afraid to ask anyone in here for help. and the girl, maybe 14 or 15 just screams its called social anxiety!! then throws the stuff she had in her hands in the air and runs out of the store. the grandmother just rolled her eyes apologized, and slowly walked out.
5871	30729	437	blna2q	emqhvcv	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i'm willing to bet it always was. i worked in a spencer's for a while and it was a good set up for high schoolers/young college students to pretend they weren't drinking as they were buying beer bongs and beer pong tables or drinking games

(like black friday, but its the day after christmas) and this lady is getting so upset that she cant get a better deal on some graphic tees (the deal was $15 tees instead of the usual deal which was buy 2 get 1 free) she wanted both deals, and the cashier was explaining to her how deals werent combinable. so my manager stepped in to try and explain it. she starts yelling and getting so angry. a customer behind her pipes up and said something along the lines of why are you being so difficult? im sure theyre (us staff) having a hard enough day, so just let it go. and that first customer did not want to hear that, and she turned around and decked the other woman. it turned into a full blown fist fight, and mall security had to be called.

5878	30729	90	blna2q	emqx2kd	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes finally a question i'm an expert in answering!! i started as a seasonal employee and made my way up to assistant store manager. worked there for a little over 5 years, too! (would have been store manager but i decided to switch to something with holidays off, lol yay banking.iregreteverything.) anyway. * most customers were *really* awesome, even parents of kids just coming in for the holidays. but of course we had some strange birds, what retail store doesn't?! this is my fav story, and though horror, it is still wholesome ;) i had one customer who was looking for earrings for her son. i was showing her different kinds of earrings and smaller gauged plugs, explaining the process of stretching. in the middle of this, she calls her son over and asks him to show me his ears - *that he pops off his head and hands to me b/c they are prosthetic ears!!* inside i freaked the f*ck out b/c i wasn't expecting that, but i somehow managed to keep it together and ended up not only making the sale but also helping that little boy feel better about himself; he said that having a real earring would help make his ears look more real. at the end of the entire thing there was a tear in my eye. * had a customer who called and told me a story about how there was another worker there who, when she would bend over, he could see her thong and he said he made a joke to her about it but felt really bad and he wanted to apologize so if he could just have that girl call him so he could say he was sorry. told my store manager about that one before i talked to the person i thought he may have meant and turns out this weirdo was calling all the stores saying the same thing. * had a customer who wanted a couple of the women employees to try on shoes for him so he could pick something out for his wife. he was aroused. (but i mean hey he bought a couple pairs soooo win? idk.) * had a customer who would come in every sunday to give the entire working staff a hug. * had a customer who would come in every couple of weeks and ask if we had kermit the frog merchandise. (wow this list is getting long, lol. but man i used to love this job so much.)
5879	30729	89	blna2q	emr03b5	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"my roommate worked at one, here's what she texted me. ""one time i was literally just folding shirts at the front of the store, the side that faces out toward the mall and and some white woman in her 40s just screamed and then i looked at her and she did the sign of the cross at me one time i had a juggalo, in full clown paint, pay me for a t shirt in quarters a brony got pissed at me because we didn't have some sort of rainbow dash key chain or some stupid shit like that a lady called the store to ask about hair dye. she wanted purple and we had a lot of different ones. so i told her we had royal purple, lavender etc. and she asked me to describe the colors in depth to her over the phone and she got pissed at me because she couldn't visual what it looked like and then asked me what it would look like if she put it in her brown hair without bleaching it and i told her it wouldn't turn out and she got even more mad"""
5880	30729	42	blna2q	emqqobx	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i never worked there but a girl that worked at my local hot topic had real big colorful braids. and lots of piercings and make up. ive seen her have to throw multiple people out for trying to take pictures of her without her permission.
5881	30729	195	blna2q	emqq95u	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"wow this question was made for me! i've worked in hot topic for 3 years! i'm 8 time employee of the month and really well liked by most customers at my location, so much so that i'll be eating in the food court and people will come up to me and ask if i'm the hot topic girl. anyways, one day i was working a shift with one of the assistant store managers. it was an incredibly slow day and we were just tidying up the store while chatting about our pets. since there wasn't much to do, my boss thought it was a perfect time for a break, so i had the floor to myself. our location is small and usually this is fun for me because i get to help all customers that come in. however right as he leaves, we have the nastiest, rudest two women come in. they charge right up to me and begin screaming at me in a chinese language, i'm unsure if it was mandarin or cantonese. note, i'm half japanese half white but people often think i'm just white. so cut back to the story, these two women are screaming at me. i calmly tell them i have no idea what they're trying to tell me as i only speak english and the tiniest bit of french. the one woman just starts shouting return as close to my face as possible. so i ask for her receipt. no receipt. if they don't have a receipt we have to ask if they have a points account so we can see previous purchases and make sure they did buy this shirt within the last 30 days. so i ask if they have a phone number or email with us. one is still screaming in her language at me and the other woman says i'm trying to steal her information. i explain that i just want to see when the shirt was purchased. the absolutely no english speaking woman pulled a different receipt from her purse and shoved it into my hands. the shirt in question wasn't even on the receipt and the receipt was from october, this happened in february. i explain this to them and say they have 30 days, not multiple months and the woman decides to say i don't know how the store works and she's done it before. i decide to at least take a look at the shirt she was trying to return. it was a pickle rick shirt that had no tag, not one but multiple stains on it and was oddly warm. i explained it needs to be unwashed, unworn and have the tags still on it to be able to be returned and the woman says ""yeah, no washed,"" as if i couldn't tell from all the stains. i tell them i won't be doing the return as if i had returned it i'd get some serious questioning from the store manager and the asm's. they leave and come back in about 10 minutes. right after the asm comes back from his break. they begin to scream at him in their language too. he is white, doesn't look remotely asian at all so at this point we were both kind of like, ""what the heck?"" i explain to him the situation and he agrees that we can't return the shirt. the woman then smacks me with the receipt she had and begins screaming in my face in her language. the other woman says we are too rude, and should be fired. i decide enough's enough and we'll call security. i'm waiting for them to pick up and my boss says, let's just do the return. then he retracts that idea once he sees the shirt. it was honestly gross. so he explains that the shirt needs to be unworn, unwashed and have the tags still on, the woman again says it wasn't washed. the other woman who spoke no english shoves my boss and screams more. my boss is the nicest person. like people are rude to him all the time and he still gives them service with a smile but will tell us his tale of woe afterwards. so he just kindly refuses to do their transaction. at this point i call security again but nobody was answering the phone. so we ask them to leave the store. they do, surprisingly. then, maybe 5 minutes later, they come back with a woman from michael hill, a fancy jewelry store who basically was trying to act as their translator with some obviously made up story that they were vacationing in canada and there was no way she could be bought the shirt in october because they had only been there a week. i asked how she had a receipt from our location from october and she ignored my question and just argued with the store manager over the return in question. after guilt tripping him and offering him a discount on rings if he ever needed one, she convinced him to do the return. at this point i walked away from the cash because we had other customers. as i was talking to one of our regulars, they were leaving. the one woman who didn't speak a word of english pushed me on her way out. had i not been at work, i seriously would've considered punching her. but this customer, who happens to think i'm one of the kindest and most helpful associates we have, gets fired up from this and begins telling them how rude it was and how they can't go around shoving people. the make the rude blah blah blah hand motion to him and smirk at me. nice customer feels badly for me and says he doesn't know how i deal with stuff like that. nice customer also tells customer service about what happened and that i'm great so if there's any complaints he wants to cancel them out. luckily there was no complaint but i'd be happy if i never saw those woman again."
5882	30729	71	blna2q	emqqbhb	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i never worked there but in my youth hanging at the mall was like totally the thing to do and hot topic was in my price range for shopping. the time in question i was super hung over and aimlessly browsing while waiting for a friend at the pager store when some dude asked me if i wanted to see something cool. i hate being approached in public so i just said yes. he proceeded to whip out his ber-pierced cock. i nearly beer-shat my pants.
5883	30729	2906	blna2q	empymbu	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my first job was at a hot topic in a dying mall. i was 16. one of the worst parts of the job was folding t-shirts. it seemed like every person who touched a t-shirt would ball it up and throw it somewhere out of place. i probably folded thousands of t-shirts. but whatever, just part of the job. i started there when they first began their rewards program. my manager was always on my ass trying to get me to sell this membership. nobody wanted a damn membership, or maybe i was a bad salesman, but either way, i rarely signed anyone up. this was reflected on the weekly report sent to the district manager, and i even got written up over it. i started working there because i loved music, and their album rack was always down my alley. they're a musically oriented company, so they had this sound system integrated with a central server that played a selection of maybe 10 songs, to be updated every month. well it didn't update for close to 3 months. every day i would hear the same songs 5 or 6 times over, for months, and it *drove me insane*. to this day i still get burnt out on music faster than anyone i know. during my breaks i would hang out in the run down, barely open mall and grab a bite at the auntie ann's. their pizza pretzel was my shit, and the cute cashier would hook me up with free marinara. we would flirt and chat all the time. i eventually got her number, i texted her (with my flip motorola) and we planned to hang out. i had my older friend buy me a four loco, when they still had caffeine, and i drove to her place at 10pm to pick her up. we shared the drink in the car on the way back to my house. we barely talked, unlike at the mall. very awkward. i took her to my sparsely furnished, unfinished basement and immediately we went at it. when we were done we kind of awkwardly sat there and i took her home just after midnight. from then on she would come into the hot topic to look for me and i would hide in the back while my manager covered for me. i totally ghosted her texts too. soon after i got fired for showing up hungover too many times, and i started to work at the pac sun right next door. that place is a whole other story.
5884	30729	145	blna2q	emqqm3b	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	super late to this party, but i worked at ht for about 3 months. it was, and still is the worst job ive ever had. the management was just atrocious and the micromanaging was on a level i didnt know was even possible. so, i guess my horror story is just working there, with their pos system straight outa 1990. i purposely got fired by spending an entire open to close shift giving my employee discount to everyone that came in on a busy saturday though.
5885	30729	36	blna2q	emqs43m	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	ah yes, my time to shine. a personal favorite of mine was a weeknight that i was working alone, seeing as we didnt get a lot of customers that late unless it was a friday or saturday. i had pretty much taken care of all the organizing and cleaning up that needed done on the floor, everything that had to go out the next day was out. so i was just strolling around the floor looking for stuff to fold and this lady comes in. she looked young but i honestly thought she was older than me (i was 19 at the time). she strikes up a conversation with me almost immediately and i rattle off my retail manager jargon, asking if i can help her find anything and letting her know the sales. after she looks around for a minute, she asks if we sell any nipple rings. we did have a few, so i told her yes and opened up the cabinet that held that particular style of body jewelry. the rule was that we had to stand with the customer and be near them when those cases were open so they didnt steal. as she looked, she asked me to get down with her and look give my opinions on what she was looking at. i felt a little awkward, and honestly i thought nipple rings were a little much, but i tried my best to be friendly and told her yeah, that ones cool. and let her know we had more on our clearance shelves. eventually, while she was looking, she decided to dive into the story of how she got it, and how she thought the size of her current piercing was different than it should be. i nodded along and said whatever oh, dang. or yeeeah. it whatever to make sure she didnt think i was ignoring her. then she asked me if i wanted to see it. oh, no thank you. i believe you no, no, really! [her current ring] looks bigger than it should be. thats weird, but no you dont have to show me. she accepts is and moves on to looking at hair dye. now, she asks me to join her in sitting on the floor and seeing what hair color she should get. i obliged her until more customers finally came in (thank god), but before that happened, she once again asked me if i wanted to see her nipple piercing. again, i declined. she acted like i was missing out on something. oh yeah, and i also had a pair of 40-yr. old moms come in and flirt with me at the register when they checked out. one asked if they could take me and get me a drink for being so helpful and i told her no, im too young. and she said no one needs to know!, so i told her i was a straightedge, she asked if that included sex, and mentioned her friend was interested before they left. what a store.
5886	30729	77	blna2q	emqo5hw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i know im late to the game and no one will see this but i worked at hot topic for a year, these are my experiences. white teenage girls yelling at the top of their lungs at there parents about something and dropping all of the curse words; we tell them to leave because familys are around and they look at you like wtf. teenagers coming in asking for razors to cut themself with and then laughing with their friends; no joke that happened twice. during the time, 2006, everyone buying misfits shirts and then look at you weird when you ask them their favorite song buy them; mine still is last caress. people stealing shit. fun fact, if youre a girl, put your stolen stuff in your purse because staff cant look in there. i have learned that people forget how to fold a shirt when they try to put a shirt back and just shut it into the shirt stack. working the christmas holidays suck because it takes over an hour or two to put everything in the store back when youre closing. lastly, this isnt bad but when i worked there, they had the biggest storage of mp3s i had seen at that time. millions of songs to choose from when working and that was pretty cool. nothing to crazy but that was my experience with working at hot topic.
5887	30729	56	blna2q	emqv8n0	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"not hot topic, but i used to be a manager at pacsun which is very hot topic adjacent, usually the same clientele, in my case the stores were literally next to each other. this was in 2013 before kendall and kylie jenner were known for uh. what they ""do"" today. they had a fashion line that was sold through pacsun and were just instagram stars. well teenage girls fucking ate all their clothes up and every time there was a release they would line up outside of the store and go wild. one of the major and (pretty fucked up if you ask me) issues was the sizing. all of the sizing was extremely distorted from ""normal"". i know that womens clothing sizes often vary from brand to brand but this was just insane. what would normally do a size 4 was a 0 in their jean shorts. it was almost like it was designed to make teenage girls feel bad. needless to say we had a fuck ton of returns. also, there was one instance where kendall and kylie tweeted that they were in a pacsun doing a meet and great, they tagged the pacsun which was literally on the opposite side of the country but apparently no one read that because about 400 people called the store asking for them (i thought they were prank calls at first) and another 1000 showed up to mob us and left angry when they weren't there. so yeah, i fucking hate kendall and kylie."
