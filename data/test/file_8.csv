6863	25561	6070	bltmmq	emssohy	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	not sure if this happens elsewhere but in the uk, you lose your title as a doctor when you become a surgeon because historically surgeons were butchers and barbers rather than qualified health professionals. i know you shouldnt be a doctor if your only goal is to achieve that title but after all those years in medical school and surgical training (which is really long too), losing your title as a doctor for no reason other than history is pretty dumb

"the stigma against expressing your feelings (especially if they're negative, and especially if you're a guy) and the idea that seeking help for mental or emotional problems is weakness. this might not be as prominent as it once was, since people have become more aware and accepting of mental health issues, but i have to wonder how much less suffering there would be if people didn't feel like they had to bottle up their feelings all the time and ""tough it out""."

6876	25561	7751	bltmmq	emsdqq8	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	"maybe not ""tradition"", but not including tax in prices and needing to tip. i was in australia recently and the price they say is the price you pay. the price seems higher but if you remember that it includes taxes and tip it's actually about the same."
6877	25561	13531	bltmmq	emrnmfe	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	before we got married, my wife's mother continued to demand that she wear an apron in the ceremony over her wedding dress. this was to signify her new role as a housewife, and to allow a place for men to put money in exchange for dances. both of these reasons made both my wife and i feel skeevy. mil claimed it was a tradition from poland (whether this is true or not i'm not actually sure) and that it was demanded of us during the wedding. so we just eloped at the courthouse and avoided the drama.

6899	25561	4929	bltmmq	emrf8w2	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	*that family is so important that if they treat you like shit you can't cut them out of your life* (since everyone seems to be focused on a quote where literally no one knows the origin instead of the actual belief that needs to 'go away'). ~~the belief that 'blood is thicker than water.'~~ no. if your family is toxic, boot them out of your life. edit: ~~~~so i stop getting the same reply, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_is_thicker_than_water) which i don't 100% believe ever, the origins are based on an old english proverb that family ties are stronger than others. it's just a quote i was using to explain what i think needs to go away. ~~~~ the main point is of course that if your family treat you like shit you have zero obligation to continue having anything to do with them. **no one deserves to be mentally, physically or emotionally abused by anyone.**
6900	25561	3912	bltmmq	ems3xzy	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	"during (straight) weddings, there is supposed to be a sentiment that the groom is ""trapped"". he doesn't want to be there, his wife has ""won"", etc. this will manifest in pictures, signage, invitations, and more. it's ridiculous - marriage is a partnership between two people who both decide they want it."

6907	25561	839	bltmmq	emsju9o	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	declawing cats. imagine having not just your finger but your whole knuckle taken out of your hand? thats what they do to cats. i know its banned in some places but idk where exactly, and if youre afraid of your cat attacking your child bc the child might aggravate it then dont get a cat or teach the child to be gentle or leave it alone (i know how hard that can be with a 3 y/o though). also, claw trimming is acceptable as long as you dont trim the pink of their nails or get too close to the pink.

6912	25561	157	bltmmq	emsqkvf	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	having to wear a suit and tie in finance roles. im positive it makes us less productive and definitely makes is more uncomfortable. sweating all day every day. can never be cold enough in the office. and they think its required for when older clients come in. 95 percent of these rich clients come in an make a comment on how you dont have to get dressed up because they sure as hell are not. i can understand like golf shirts and maybe khakis or something. but full suit and tie with jacket is just over the top. plus you have to get everything tailored to make it look presentable. shit is expensive as fuck. plus dry cleaning. luckily the trend will likely die off in the next ten to fifteen years as the old fashioned management and client base ages out.
6913	25561	3173	bltmmq	ems40k5	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	asking people about their plans to have children. i'm only 21 and i am sick to death of being asked 'what will you do when you have your own kids?' or 'you'll understand when you have a baby'. nobody ever considers that i never want children, and god forbid i mention that fact to anyone because then i'm a monster. if people want kids, great, good luck to them, they'll make amazing parents i'm sure. but i won't - i don't want kids and i don't see how that is anyone else's business, or why people feel the need to try and change my mind. it's also incredibly intrusive and insensitive too. edit - wow this blew up while i was asleep, thanks for the silvers!
6914	25561	65	bltmmq	emru68c	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	giant expensive weddings. why do people stress out and spend tens of thousands of dollars on one day, when that money could go to savings or a house for the two of them? buying an engagement ring that costs 3 months worth of your salary also seems ridiculous. i am impressed that these ever became normal expectations. maybe i'm just not romantic enough to understand.
6915	25561	1597	bltmmq	emrf1v6	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	gerrymandering and voter suppression. over time these went from new ideas people were still figuring out, to something everyone knows about, and knows its wrong, but we feel powerless and apathetic because thats the way its always been.
6916	25561	66	bltmmq	emsrzto	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	arranged marriage, to many victim of rape and pedophilia forced to marry and live woth their rapist and abuser? its totally disgusting and need to be illegal everywhere. children as young as 9 have grown men as husbands set for them.

6920	25561	3073	bltmmq	emrbev7	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	i don't think it should go away for those that genuinely prefer it, but not taking your husband's last name should not have a stigma attached to it.
6921	25561	1052	bltmmq	ems7oj5	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	tipping. it's a broken system that's unfair to servers and customers.
6922	25561	96	bltmmq	emsstqo	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	paper money. in australia we have plastic money and its fucking lit. lasts forever, doesnt tear, and you can accidentally leave it in your pants when they go through the wash
6923	25561	27	bltmmq	emsdfzf	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	5-day school routines. when i went to community college, i had tons of paperwork and studying. it was ati hcp and was extremely dense amounts of material. we had fridays off to study, tested on monday, clinical/hospital all day on thursday. really, lecture was only tuesday and wednesday. the more i think about it, the more energy i had to go to class & participate because i *actually* felt rested and prepared. the semesters *flew* by. it went sooo quickly! i loved it. i didnt have boredom because the lectures moved fast. i enjoyed taking my time all weekend and still having time for church. it was great. im not sure what the public school system believes what exactly they need to pull off anymore. everything is changing so much, that i dont know how much time they need in a week. but, the older you get, the more it seems to be this: priorities fall back on your own free time, anyways. you dont really learn in class as much as write/type or something like that. my opinion in college was that they simply read the lecture & ask if theres questions. they also point out priorities for people to learn and explain assignments. as soon as you get home, you have to start teaching it to yourself, really. sometimes time in class feels like a waste because. ultimately, you have to learn it on your own through memorization. it also made me think that really there are a lot of students who struggle with applying themselves with homework. if monday through thursday moves that fast with that heavy of material. theres not really a choice but to be responsible on friday. it actually totally teaches self-discipline and accountability. its amazing what you can pull off when you just dont have any choice but to pull it off.
6924	25561	28	bltmmq	emsyncg	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	staying married to an incompatible partner. you see this mostly in older folks and couples with kids. prime example, my exs parents. they dont openly argue in front of us but its clear they dont love or respect each other. and yet year after year, they stay married because its easier than divorcing. i also have a friend for whom all 3 children were conceived because they thought it could fix their marriage. nope, hes still utterly miserable and with 3 young kids is getting laid even less than he was before (which wasnt much back then either). he hasnt left her because he doesnt think its fair to the kids.
6925	25561	1762	bltmmq	emr9vs0	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	weddings and all the associated shit that goes with it.
6926	25561	260	bltmmq	ems3zr4	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	the american work culture. in lots of places around the world, people will get 7, 8 weeks of vacation. not allowed to be there past 5. dont take their work home on the weekends. but we do it so much differently. it's pointless and stupid and it needs to stop
6927	25561	424	bltmmq	emrgdx0	"what really needs to go away but still exists only because of ""tradition""?"	"making little kids hug or kiss people they don't want to because it's ""polite"". unless you *want* to teach your kid that they don't have bodily autonomy and should tolerate unwanted touches from people. because it's *such* a good life lesson and *definitely* doesn't lead to silence on the part of children facing abuse."
