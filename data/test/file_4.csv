136	61851	1404	bri3ja	eoeab8o	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	when i came out of surgery at 14 i told everyone i was fine and just felt like a gatorade. mum got it for me, opened the lid and handed it over, i took it and maintaining direct eye contact with her i tipped it upside down no where near my mouth. got gatorade all over me and was super confused, that's where my memory ends. mum tells me after looking briefly confused i just shrugged and settled back down to fall asleep.
137	61851	2528	bri3ja	eoea8kw	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"i had surgery last year and when waking up they had a communal room where around 7-8 people would all be waking up at the same time before being sent to individual rooms for some reason. i remember waking up slowly and hearing someone else being asked if they wanted some water. for some reason this *really* excited me. like, there was nothing more in the entire world i wanted than to be asked if i wanted water. i practically yelled (or as much as i could yell in that state) ""hey, ask me if i want water!"", and i'm pretty sure it came out in a ""let me speak to your manager tone"", but i was just so excited about the water."

141	61851	2613	bri3ja	eoe9qsc	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"backstory: i have epilepsy and a vegal nerve stimulator to control the seizures. it works wonders. from 3 to 4 seizures a week to almost none a year. i went in for the replacement of my device. going under i looked at my mother and started laughing hysterically. she asked what was funny. i said she had horns. and as i was coming out of all the drugs the nurse was kind of a jackass to me so i said, ""oh man the next time i puke i'm gonna puke on you"". i did. he said, ""man your aim is good, i'm not even mad at you"". edit: dude silver! thank you whoever you are that's awesome!!!"

145	61851	19516	bri3ja	eoe8s5r	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"in high school i had a reconstructive surgery on my knee as i tore my acl and meniscus in a sports injury. after the surgery i woke up in post op, which was a fairly large room with probably 6 to 7 other patients in beds waiting to become conscious again. i was lying there all groggy and confused when two nurses walked over pushing one of those carts with a computer on it. they stood over me and were typing into the computer when one nurse said to the other in a sort of frantic whisper ""we've got to plug this thing in or this one is going to die!"". naturally, semi conscious me thought that the ""thing"" was me and i started to incoherently yell for the nurses to unplug whatever they needed to in order to find an outlet to keep me alive. turns out it was the battery on the laptop that was going to die. apparently the death rate for an acl repair is pretty low."

150	61851	3424	bri3ja	eoecor1	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"me after getting my wisdom teeth taken out. nurse warned my mom that i'd probably be saying some crazy shit until i came down fully, which i thought was total bullshit, as i was super lucid. felt like i could walk around fine, and was slightly annoyed, but understood when they loaded me in the wheelchair. they clearly told me that i couldn't eat solid food, how to treat the massive holes in my gums, etc. however- i was craving a poptart, like needed one asap, mouth drooling (probably actually bleeding, but whatever), and having in depth fantasies of going to town on the largest pack i could find. quite conveniently in the car on the way home, i discovered nothing else, but a cookies and cream poptart pack. i'm seriously making sweet mouth love to this pastry, never happier, until i remember- i'm not supposed to eat solid foods. i shamefully tell my mom the news, and that she has to take my brief, but delicious love away from me. i specifically remember saying, ""it's for the greater good"". so i'm trying to hand her my poptart from the back seat, while she's driving on the highway no less, when i realise the poptart isn't there. the poptart never existed, besides in my mind. she says, ""okay, tolkien, i got it honey"", and i reply "". the poptart was fake, wasn't it?"". i giggled for a bit, then went back to doing whatever the hell i wanted in my head fun times, 10/10 would do again"

153	61851	33682	bri3ja	eoe7d0w	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	my husband went under last year, and once he woke up, by a appearances he was as sober as a church mouse. walking, asking serious questions of the doctor, apparently no issues are all. he remembered the procedure and described it to me in detail. i figured he just never went completely under. he was craving chinese food, and nothing would do except for buffet, so we headed down and loaded up our first load of plates. evidently, he actually woke up from the anesthesia at the buffet. as far as he remembers, he was put under and woke up in front of a plate of chicken teriyaki on a stick.

158	61851	30552	bri3ja	eoe7ftf	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	last year they were knocking me out for a colonoscopy. it was the third time i had been put under in a year. as such i had a curiosity: i had heard that when they knock you out you are still awake for awhile, you just dont remember. so in the spirit of science i proposed a test with the anesthesiologist: when she started the medicine i would begin counting backward. when i would wake up we would compare what i remembered to what she observed. plunger down - 99, 98, 97 - i remembered nothing more. minutes later i awoke. the anesthesiologist espied me and came over quickly. what did you remember? she asked. 97 she began laughing. you got down to 7!

162	61851	3893	bri3ja	eoe6fdw	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"not an anesthesiologist, but i knew a guy who had surgery and afterwards wanted to go home. just. he wasn't recovered enough to and the nurse wasn't gonna let him get up yet. he turned to the nurse and said: ""you may not realize this, but i'm a ninja and we heal three times faster than normal people."" at that the nurse stopped trying to keep him in bed, he stood and immediately ate the floor."

171	61851	12314	bri3ja	eoeajkm	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"my fiance and i had broken up within the last week and was still dealing with that horribly. i was on pain meds for my shoulder and was scheduled for surgery in the current week. the day of the surgery, i was to get a nerve block, the anesthesiologist was the one performing the nerve block. he and i were chit-chatting, and he was just a really comforting person. he was telling me about everything that was going to go on during the surgery. then we were just chit-chatting about life when the topic of the break-up came up. he was even comforting with that. so after that, i was wheeled into surgery. he was there to put me under, which for some reason put me at great ease. as i was going under, i guess i started talking through the mask and he lifted the mask to hear what i was trying to say. when i boldly stated ""i still love you <fiance's name>"" while holding direct eye contact with him. i didn't know i did it. not until he visited me in recovery. he said ""thanks for the nickname."" then told me what i said. i guess the entire surgical staff referred to him by my fiance's name for the duration of the surgery. so not only did i call this poor guy a woman's name that stuck with him for the duration for the surgery, i stated how much i loved him to boot. when i went back for the second surgery, guess who my anesthesiologist was? regardless of my foul-ups, he is an awesome anesthesiologist and really good at his job."

"my wife couldn't take me for my first colonoscopy due to work so my mother did, and apparently coming out of anesthesia, when they were removing my iv, i told the nurse, ""oh, that's neat. i've taken a lot of those out, but i've never had it done to me, and my patients are always dead."" apparently she looked very concerned by this information and my mother had to explain that i've been a licensed funeral director for many years and hospitals and other facilities often do not remove tubing. apparently i then followed that up by telling the (young) nurse she had a nice butt, but not as nice as my wife's. my mother felt free to share that with everyone. so yeah. i creeped out a nurse by talking about my occupation, and then even more by commenting on her butt in a backhanded compliment. edit: thank you for the silver!"

241	61851	118	bri3ja	eoeaal3	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	when i went under getting my wisdom teeth removed, i awoke mid removal but all i remember is seeing the bright light the dentist was using. being under the influence of the gas, i was fascinated by the bright shiny light and reached for it. the doctor put my hand back down and kept working in my mouth. i laid there still staring at the light. i just wanted to touch it! i attempt to grab it again and the dentist again puts my hand back down and kind of chuckled. this aggravated me. who was he to say i couldnt grab the light?? i lay still for a second watching the dentist work. i decide i have to be quick and sneaky. i counted to three and bolted up and grabbed the light. the dentist guided my hand back down and asked me to be still, he turned around i think he turned the gas up or something because then i crashed again. the next time i awoke i was in the car with my mom in the passenger seat. still loopy as hell, i heard nikki minajs super bass on the radio, turned it way up, and (according to my moms retelling and my partial memory) started head banging yelling niiiikkkkkkiiii!!! lets go. after 18 seconds of that, i crash again and wake up in my bed several hours later regretting how i acted and being thankful of my dentists patience.
