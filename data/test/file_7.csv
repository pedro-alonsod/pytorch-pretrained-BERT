6507	28060	9087	bqltzq	eo62qkp	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i posted to my local subreddit for a few weeks that i was going to play trivia every so often, looking for new friends. one time a guy comments sure, sounds like fun. so we're at trivia (with 2 other friends of mine) and i just immediately like him. i get him to follow us to karaoke after that. i messaged him a few times, found out he was on okcupid and was single and asked him out about a week or two later. been together almost 7 years now and married for almost 3! 
6508	28060	18597	bqltzq	eo62ec0	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"right after college i moved to a new city by myself and i was having trouble meeting people. i ventured onto the city's subreddit and saw a meetup posted for a halloween pub crawl, so i decided to go. i told the group what costume i would be wearing and headed out. i got to the first bar a bit late, so i assumed the group had moved to the next one. the group saw me from the line for the next bar and called me over, but just as they did two very shady-looking guys who had apparently been following me since the last bar popped up from behind me and told me they were here to ""take me to the party."" one of the members of the reddit group i was going to meet stepped forward and said ""no, this is our friend, she's with us, you two can leave."" so, essentially a group of reddit strangers saved me from real-life strangers. that was five years ago, and the group i met that night and i are still super close even though only about half of the original group still lives in the same city. we groupchat and/or roast each other every day. i also met my so of 3+ years through the group, so thanks to reddit not only did i not get kidnapped but i also met most of my favorite people in the world."
6509	28060	5901	bqltzq	eo5tjuu	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"my now-husband and i both responded to a thread looking for players for a particular roleplaying game, and time and commitments worked out so that we both ended up in the same group playing this game. we got to chatting outside the game when i'd mentioned something about my ex husband, who i still lived with at the time despite being divorced. my now-husband was confused about my living situation, so he asked me a few questions, we started chatting more and ended up playing in another game together. at the time i was single, but not really looking. and i'd told myself i wasn't going to do a long-distance relationship again (my first marriage had started long-distance as well), and in chatting about this, my now-husband joked and said ""i'm going to make you love me."" it went on for a few months after that, and in early 2014 we had a long chat by email and through skype, a lot of back and forth and eventually decided that okay, yeah, we'd try this thing. he was in the uk, i was in australia. i went to the uk for the first time ever to visit him at the end of 2015. i went back again at the end of 2016 and in january 2017 he asked me to marry him. that was also the weekend my ex husband died, so it was a very happy moment followed by several of the most traumatic weeks of my life. but my partner was so supportive and caring through the whole thing, i knew i'd made the right decision. i'd already sold my house in australia back at the beginning of 2016, and unfortunately shortly after my ex passed away, our dog also died. so there was very little tying me back to my home country. we prepared all the documents and requirements for planning a wedding and a fiancee visa for the uk, and in august 2018 my visa was granted. i quit my job of 10 years, got on a plane and arrived in the uk in september 2018. we were married in october, and my temporary residence was approved in january 2019. we've been living together since september. things aren't always perfect, but i'm happier than i'd been in a very long time. he's a very sweet man, i adore him to the ends of the earth, and i'm so happy that i get to spend (hopefully!) the rest of my life with him."
6510	28060	4301	bqltzq	eo62m77	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had just moved to nz and the auckland sub was having semi regular meet ups. i decided to go and meet some new people. my partner was a local but had broken up with his girlfriend a few months prior and decided to go to the meet up for similar reasons. we made a good group of friends and ended up at a few outings together and started flirting. we started dating a couple months before my visa was up but could tell this had potential to be something special. we decided to move in together so that i would be eligible for a partnership visa and stay in the county. it made the relationship move pretty fast, but 5+ years later, were married, bought a house in auckland (a huge feat these days!), have a lovely 2 year old pupper, and just welcomed our baby girl into the world in march. we are so in love and have a wonderful, happy life together. all thanks to r/auckland having some meet ups at the local pub.
6511	28060	7334	bqltzq	eo5rzht	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on a friend making subreddit after a really bad break up. long distance for 3 years, together 5 years this october. he lived a couple states over from me. we would skype every day for hours. we started off as friends but it turned into something more. still love him edit: the sub was /r/needafriend
6512	28060	1208	bqltzq	eo61mnc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i moved to another country to be an au pair after college and didnt know anyone who had ever been there. a boy in the city i was moving to asked if any americans wanted to get coffee or beer so he could practice his english. he shared his twitter profile so he seemed normal. i also read about how hard it was to make friends in norway so i was all over the idea of my first possible friend. he gave me a lot of good advice before i moved. he studied in the us as a college student so had some good points of help. three weeks after i moved he invited me to a party, i got pretty wasted, and he let me sleep in his bed while he slept on the couch. a month later we were dating and six months later we were engaged. a year later he moved to the us and a week after that we got married. now, four years later, we have a cute puppy with a heart shaped nose and we will go back to norway for his 30th this summer. i only started using reddit to ask questions before i moved to another country but since it brought me to meet my person i figured its worth sticking around on. major shoutout to r/norway *edit: meet bandit here: https://imgur.com/d2zoavb
6513	28060	26720	bqltzq	eo5y4yz	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	someone posted a photo of jamaican patties that hit the front page. i commented that amazing patties were sold at a plaza near me (a rather obscure suburban one). i got replies saying i never thought id see ___ plaza mentioned on reddit! one user sent me a message asking for other takeout suggestions as hed just moved near the plaza i wrote about. he mentioned his first name and the big box shop he works at, asking if i knew any good places near there as well. fast forward two years and im shopping at the aforementioned big box shop, unable to find the item i need. i ask for help, and this cute guy starts looking up the item. i notice his name tag and the memory just clicks for some reason. me: is your name ___? him: uh. yep. me: do you go on reddit? him: uh.yes. me: we chatted two years ago about food. him (relieved): oh! weve been together over two years and are moving in together this july. :)
6514	28060	8669	bqltzq	eo61lj6	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my ex-gf now best friend on reddit. she uploaded the picture of one of the cats in my college campus, i identified it, texted, and eventually we met up in college. best relationship ever however while being with me she learned that she wasnt into men. so we stayed as friends and hang out almost everyday.

6517	28060	8567	bqltzq	eo655wj	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	was going through a depressive time. july 16th, 2017 was the death date i decided for myself. i purchased a lot of drugs. i was gonna od myself. i was addicted to oxycontin. i also self harmed july 15th, 2017, i decided to go do something that i loved for my last day on earth. play some video games i got into a lobby of 4 people. usually id mute the players and play music instead but for some reason something told me to listen. there was a woman in the lobby. she tried including me on the conversations she was having with her 3 friends. so i joined in and it was all great and fun. the next day, my death date, we chatted all day and played video games all night. she made me feel happy and totally made me forget about wanting to kill my self and made the loud voice in my head quiet. to this day, weve almost known each other for 2 years. shes my girlfriend and soon-to-be fiance. she has two amazing kids and i love them both. they call me dad. she saved my life and gave me a family and lots of love. i owe her the world.
6518	28060	2387	bqltzq	eo5r5qs	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"never on reddit, though i'd consider there are a couple of people i've interacted with on here enough that i actually care about them. i met one girl on a message board a long time ago though. not like, ""met a girl and wanted to bang"" but someone who liked the same bands as me and was actually interesting to talk to. i've been talking to her for 25 years and never met her. she knows all about my life, family, ups / downs etc - and i about hers. i'd say it's a truly pure and amazing friendship. outside my immediate family the most important to me. she literally is a best friend who doesn't really judge and actually cannot judge, and i know i truly care about and cares about me. it's one of my few constants in this world."
6519	28060	2345	bqltzq	eo5yv5z	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on a writing subreddit. started talking, and talking turned into getting to know each other. i wasnt 100% sure i wanted to really start a relationship, and i honestly tried to end things and just walk away, but he sent me a really sweet, heartfelt message (on valentines, of all days) and i realized, huh, maybe this guy does like me, and hes actually been paying attention/learning about me. fast forward 2 months, and after weeks of asking, i tell him he can take me out on a date. he drives 7 hours to come see me. god, we were both so nervous. he could barely talk and i couldnt shut up. he kissed me in the parking lot (my first kiss!) and spent the weekend with me. that was over 2 years ago- weve been living together nearly a year, have 2 fur babies, and im more in love with him now than ever. hes the best choice i ever made. best little orange envelope ever. 
6520	28060	1671	bqltzq	eo5qti7	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	**edit:** sorry if this reads kind of funny i'm using voice to text. we met on the organic chemistry subreddit i used to post there a lot when i was a tutor and help people work through problems and reaction mechanisms. she asked me a lot of really good questions and i enjoyed it explaining them to her. her curriculum was relatively hard for being in o-chem i, so i asked which school she went to. turns out we went to the same school and figured it would be easier to meet in person for tutoring. instantly knew i really liked her she was smart funny loved to workout and had huge ambitions. i told her as soon as i knew my feelings about her and she replied in a text saying i really like you too. but that was it she didn't say anything else which really confuse me. after like four or five hours of neither person saying anything i texted her saying so do you like me enough to date me? she said that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend but that she liked me more then just a friend. after telling her that i liked her i stopped charging her for our tutoring session and just did it because i enjoyed teaching her and the conversations that we would have throughout. after about four months towards the end of the semester she finally told me that she thought she really liked me too and wanted to give this relationship thing a chance. it's been an amazing 3 years and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with his girl. **edit:** also, before people start making puns. yes, i know we have chemistry.
6521	28060	354	bqltzq	eo65u8p	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	posted on /r/r4r looking for an nfl watching buddy. since im a woman, i received upwards of 100 messages (any woman thats ever posted on that sub knows how it is, but i made it harder on myself posting about a male-dominated hobby). for some reason one guy in particular stuck out. we messaged on and off and for brief periods of time for about four months. from then on we started chatting a lot more consistently. i had already developed a thing for him. and then i found out he lived in my dream city on top of it! 2100 miles apart and somehow we made long distance work for three years. after ten visits back and forth, this past december my dog and i moved in with him. hes sitting beside me right now. :)
6522	28060	460	bqltzq	eo5rrew	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	not through reddit but i saw reddit in the bookmarks of a now really good friend, when we met not long ago, so i started talk about it, now joke about reddit and memes. it's cool, it's the only guy who understands my irl memes references. but we don't know each other's username.
6523	28060	716	bqltzq	eo614nf	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was a high school graduate and extremely bored so i decided to stay up all night and get donuts at stupid early in the morning. i really wanted someone to talk to to keep me awake, so i browsed r/r4r for people around my age (let's be honest, i was looking for guys around my age lol). i messaged a handful of people and talked to the first ones who messaged back. there were about 3, one guy i talked to all night until i realized he was a frat boy douche, and 2 others who didn't really interest me because we didn't have the same, well, interests. i ended up messaging one of them back anyway, since i still had a couple hours to kill. he lived in pa and i lived in co. we got along just fine, but i still wasn't very interested. he asked if we could skype later that day, and i almost completely blew him off again. but i decided to give him a chance, and we skyped while playing minecraft together later that night. we had a blast and we talked for hours and hours and hours for several days. after a week or so, he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes. we met in person a couple months later and clicked instantly. we would visit each other a couple times a year until about 2 1/2 years ago, when we finally moved in together! our 5 year anniversary is in about a week. :)
6524	28060	189	bqltzq	eo649dg	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my best mommy friend on reddit! i was in a due date subreddit for pregnant women who were due in the same month and that spun off into a facebook group. at some point i realized that one of the girls lived less than a mile from our house so we decided to meet up. our little girls were born a week apart and now they will grow up together.
6525	28060	323	bqltzq	eo5uiuu	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my boyfriend on the /r/meetpeople subreddit 2 years ago we became friends and became officially a couple 1,5 year ago. its amazing to me how someone can become such an important part of your daily life. even though he is so far away i have never felt this close to anyone before. something that i really like is that we communicate in a respectful way even if there is conflict. we try and always be open and honest, and i believe we are both very empathetic to each others feelings and struggles :)
6526	28060	90	bqltzq	eo6a6s0	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"i found the woman that took care of my father before he died. i had never met nor seen a photo of my father my entire adult life. long story short, i knew his name, his social security number and that he was born in marseille, france. posted something to reddit private investigators - a few days later, a fellow redditor on that forum gave me a name and phone number of someone that was listed as relative or close friend (he did this for free). i called her and she returned my call. thanks to that great man / redditor i later exchanged letters with ""rose"", she told me how my father died of dementia, how they met, sent me photos of my father and my distant sister (i never knew i had). it was closure of not knowing him, not ever seeing photos and details on a chapter of my life i never thought i would know. so, yes, reddit can be a great and powerful tool thanks to a great community."
6527	28060	438	bqltzq	eo620rd	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met a kid my age on r/teenagers (yes i am a teen too). he is a closeted gay and i have depression so we both have someone to talk about our problems with. we play games together and weve introduced each other to our other friends. we talk all the time when we arent playing games and hes just a cool guy.
6528	28060	364	bqltzq	eo5zl27	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	ill keep it short. i ended up with 2 different girls (users) from r/uruguay. first one. didnt end so well. .at all. im still dating the second one, shes beautiful and very similar to me. our first date was at night, and it was raining like it never had in the past year at least, classic romcom clich.
6529	28060	157	bqltzq	eo61uvs	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"""what do you call a sad computer?.adele."" apparently one terrible joke is all it took for us to start a conversation, followed by more talking, video chats, and him buying a plane ticket after a month and flying over 3000 miles to see me. we started dating as soon as we met, have been together a year, and are moving in together soon :)"
6530	28060	401	bqltzq	eo62pek	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	she flirted with me using the reddits dms and i went over to her house, it was a guy with no pants
6531	28060	246	bqltzq	eo60hfj	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"met on a subreddit's discord server during a strange time in my life. we and a few others branched off into our own group, played video games together and some nights there'd just be three of us sat up late at night talking about anything. sometimes the other guy went to bed, other times we all went off at the same time. i fell for this guy on his voice and personality at first - as odd as that sounds, he was such a *nice* person to be around and talk to, and he had a nice voice. when he sent me a photo of himself he was also very much my type. a short while later, i get tired of dropping hints hoping he'd ask me or initiate the ""romance talk"", so i took the bull by the horns and told him how i felt. he admitted he'd never actually considered an ldr, took a few days to process and then he got back to me and admitted i'd been on his mind a lot and he felt he was starting to feel the same way about me. we've been together for nearly two years now, in an ldr that's about 400 miles apart. we're closing the distance in less than 7 weeks time now, though. i can't wait :)"
6532	28060	335	bqltzq	eo60fdq	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?

6533	28060	184	bqltzq	eo63m9t	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so at a reddit meet up 4 years ago, i wanted to make some new friends but i was not looking for a relationship. he got very drunk and told me he liked me and asked me on a date, i thought he was cute and seemed funny and interesting (i was right). the past 4 years have been amazing, challenging and i would not have been able to predict my life would turn out this way.
6534	28060	63	bqltzq	eo63bm2	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my husband because of reddit! we were both a part of our city's local subreddit, and there was a post about favorite local food and bands, so i commented on it indicating my favorite local band was mustard plug. turns out his cousin is in the band, and he mentioned that. he came over to hang out and drink beers/smoke weed and our relationship developed over the next 6 months. 2 years later our son was born. 3 years after that and we were married.
6535	28060	100	bqltzq	eo656xa	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i'm disabled and have no friends, thanks to reddit i met a person a month ago after years of chatting. feels good, i hope to meet this person again and again, but we live in distant cities so it's hard. this made me more self-confident and happy, i can't explain to you how i felt that day.

6538	28060	45	bqltzq	eo621u1	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i actually met my so on reddit while posting in r4r specifically for a platonic friend! &#x200b; i did talk to some cool people who responded, one or two for even a couple of months after, but with my fiancee it was like an instant click. i've been married before and had various other long term and meaningful relationships, but nothing like this at all. the kind of person who makes you feel dumb for thinking anyone else you'd ever been with could have worked out, and i knew i was going to want more than friendship after just a couple of hours. &#x200b; we live 2200 miles apart (3540km), but she bought a plane ticket to come see me after 48 hours of (almost constant) talking (shes the adventurous one)! within a month i was picking her up at the airport! we've been together for 19 months now and usually see each other about every 6 to 10 weeks. &#x200b; still, by an incredible lead, the best relationship i've ever been in or experienced.
6539	28060	41	bqltzq	eo65f4a	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met on a mutual subreddit and then realized we frequented other subs. we moved the conversation to snapchat, then whatsapp, then face to face. he was in england, i was in america. over five years later and a shit ton of paperwork, we celebrate our one year anniversary next month! sometimes you just click.
6540	28060	106	bqltzq	eo63an3	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was a really really lonely bi guy who had given up on girls, and so i always browsed new on lgbt subreddits hoping i'd meet someone. well. one day someone posted that they were lonely and wanted to talk. i sent them a pm, got his snap, and we talked. all night long. and then all of the next day until our phones died in school. and the next day and the next day and the next day etc. found out we lived in the same state--close enough to drive too--and now i've been his for a little under 13 months
6541	28060	138	bqltzq	eo60isw	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my life coach on reddit. my ~nascent~early comments made me sound like a poster boy for /r/iamverysmart . he pm'd, diagnosed my obvious insecurity and over the course of several years helped me stop giving a fuck what people think of me.
6542	28060	38	bqltzq	eo6b0d6	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	my fiancee and i met through an r4r post i made on a throwaway account. we were starting to click , but then i sent a picture of myself and didn't hear back from her for over a week. considering we we're sending messages back and forth a few times a day, i was pretty certain i scared her off with how i looked. so i sorta gave up and didn't log back into that account for almost a month. if it weren't for me just checking to see if i ever got any messages, i don't think we ever would've met. turns out she was just really late sending a response and picture back to me. in a panic i messaged her immediately. after our near-miss with each other, we slowly built up to meeting in person and it's been awesome ever since. that was over 5 years ago and we're getting married next winter :)
6543	28060	115	bqltzq	eo62cul	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	it took me 4 minutes to figure out what so means. yes i am a certified idiot. it means significant other wth

6547	28060	26	bqltzq	eo6e23l	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	wasnt on reddit, but i had a friend i met on myspace around 2005, and we kept in touch for a decade or so, sharing band recommendations and chatting. since we lived across the country from each other, neither of us sought any kind of relationship with the other. we tried to meet whenever one of us would be in or around the others neck of the woods, but it just never happened. i was diagnosed with cancer about five years ago, and he determined that he had to do whatever it took to meet me before it was too late. my mom and i were vacationing a few states away, and he drove several hours to hang out. we all had a great time and it was hard for us to say goodbye, especially after the short visit wed planned ended up extending all the way into the next morning (with encouragement from mom and even our airbnb host). we planned a longer visit after i flew home, and spent a wonderful ten days together, after which he asked if i wanted to be in a relationship with him. i declined because i was afraid that, if my cancer killed me in a few years, he wouldve wasted his time when he couldve been with someone in better health. my ex felt that i shouldve been grateful he stuck around after my diagnosis, so i wanted to spare anyone else the burden of being with me. to my surprise, this wonderful man insisted he wanted to be with me no matter what challenges lay ahead. weve been together almost three years, and not once has he made me feel unworthy or unloved despite all my flaws (hair loss, surgery scars, er visits, and other fun problems caused by the cancer or medication). we got married last december and im currently in the process of selling my place and moving to the new house he bought for us. we may have met on myspace, but reddit is one of the main things we bond over now.
6548	28060	47	bqltzq	eo60la6	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my boyfriend on a video game subreddit looking for people to play with. i made a post and got a solid handful of replies but for some reason, his was the only one i responded to. we ended up playing and talking that night and it didn't stop until the early morning. it felt so easy and so. right. i never vibed with someone like that before. i felt like he was my other half. in fact, he (thankfully) felt the same way and we've been dating ever since! it's been 1.5 years and i'm still just as giddy over him as that first night. i've never been happier. i love him so much. 
6549	28060	23	bqltzq	eo69887	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"i'm a subscriber to /r/c25k, despite not ever completing the couch-to-5k program or running on a consistent basis. it's a pretty small sub, and most posts are post-run selfies, i like to see people try to better themselves and i'd like to think i'll complete the program someday. one day on that sub i saw a before and after pic of this guy who lost almost 100 lbs. the comments were full of op answering people's questions and giving really kind, thoughtful advice - and honestly, i thought he was really cute. in a few comments he also mentioned striking out on okcupid, so i thought ""fuck it"" and sent him a message with a link to my okcupid profile. turns out he was super interested, and a few weeks later his favorite band happened to be playing a show in my city and he flew out from texas to california to see them and meet me. we hit it off amazingly and were long distance for about a year - 2000 miles away from each other. three weeks ago he moved to california to be with me. i couldn't be happier or more in love, i honestly thought love like this was a myth before i met him. we both talk all the time about how lucky we are to have found each other. /u/trenta_is_not_enough i love you!"
6550	28060	67	bqltzq	eo5ssvc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met someone on r4r that i dated for a few months. we have since broken up, but it was nice while it lasted. i talked to a lot of interesting people on r4r. it's kind of a bummer when the conversation just fades away though.
6551	28060	85	bqltzq	eo60p7w	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	no story i just wanted to post and say it's nice reading all these good stories thanks for warning my heart a little today reddit.
6552	28060	21	bqltzq	eo659pp	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i started playing a video game called digital paintball 2 around 2006 (i was around 12/13) and happened to play and team with mainly people in na (am eu), which lead to several years of awkwardly timed gaming sessions. met a group on that game i got on with very well, and eventually (in 2010ish) one of their girlfriends. theyd ask me if i had any plans to be in their cities or states at some point, as we became very good friends playing games for so many years. i told the couple id come to their wedding if they ever got married, which at the time they kinda brushed off. &#x200b; a few months ago they told me about their engagement and told me theyd love it if i could come. so, im all booked to go to their wedding in boston in july. its wild, i played games with and just generally spent a huge amount of time with these people, and now i finally get to keep my promise and see these two people i have a great deal of love for get married. they invited me to their pre and post wedding family celebrations, so im super excited to share in their special time.

6554	28060	20	bqltzq	eo62mar	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	dont give me hope, i want to be hopeless.
6555	28060	42	bqltzq	eo63sv0	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	honestly this would be great platform to meet your so. we share a lot of life struggles that people have also been through. ive been on reddit for a few months and people on here are really nice and give good input. ive been really comfortable reading through some subreddits because ive seen some people who are going through the same shit i am.
6556	28060	17	bqltzq	eo5udjn	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met some former roommates on reddit. they were cool guys. left a bong on the porch a lot which made me paranoid. but cool guys.
6557	28060	18	bqltzq	eo6cpxc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my husband in r/loseit and we both lost it and gained each other
6558	28060	17	bqltzq	eo6h6qz	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	the simple story: we were both in relationships with other people who were absolutely horrible. i made a post on an r4r subreddit specifically looking for a hookup. his genuineness was just so tangible in his message and we were in the same (ethically non-monogamous, the fact that we were with shitty people became apparent later) situation that i felt drawn to him right away. this was strange for me because i was also posting on other subreddits (r/gonewild[fill in the blank], which i met my ex on)that had me interacting with tons of guys on the daily due to the explicit stuff i was posting. so i was desensitized and kinda disillusioned by guys pickup lines (even the ones that seemed polite and nice) we meet. we hookup. i stay the night, mostly because we lost track of time and connected right away. were *very* different people but also extremely the same. we get breakfast the next day. i go home and think about him the entire week. the next week he breaks up with his girlfriend. the week after that, i break up with my boyfriend. we dont have a talk about being official right away because it just doesnt seem important. he says i love you very soon and i say it back because i feel it and i mean it. two months later, and i had drawers of things at his place. a little more time and we meet each others families. we just got married today.
6559	28060	60	bqltzq	eo65bhx	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was drunk one night and decided to look up the subreddit asainladyboners i scrolled down and the third picture caught my eye. this super attractive dude with a black suit on and long hair made my jaw drop. i had to send him a message even though i knew i would never hear back he was way out of my league. not only did he message back but weve been dating for almost a year and he treats me like a queen. im so lucky.
6560	28060	70	bqltzq	eo69q2h	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	well my story may be the weirdest one among all these. i was going through a phase where i was hitting the gym very often and getting some really good results, combine this the fact that i have a small ego that needs confirmation through posting pics of myself online.eventually i am posting myself to the r/guysgonewild sub with full body showing but nothing too explicit (genitals are covered). next thing i know i am on the front page of the sub and an inbox full of messages from females and males alike (50-50 ratio), a lot of them just wanted to sext and as a straight male i obliged and had some fun with the girls over snapchat or what have you. however i should note that i never respond to these messages asking for sexts or anything, i simply have genuine conversations with most of them and it ends in sexting in most cases. one girl however never got to the point of asking me for sexual favors and instead we spoke a lot about the meaning of life and how crazy this reality of a universe we live in is, we even got into deeper quantum mechanics than i have with any other person before. i was very much falling for her and she reciprocated the same feelings for me, we exchanged numbers and ended up texting each other daily and eventually calling each other every night for months. a year or so later i move out of my parents place and decided to rent an apartment with her. today we are still together going on 2 years soon and feel like we are each others soul mates lol
6561	28060	14	bqltzq	eo65en4	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met playing with the same guild in everquest. played together as friends for somewhere around 3 years with the guild and in groups. a handful of us met for a weekend and just hung out. my guy and i end up really clicking. a little later a bunch of us decided to meet irl, so we planned this big guild meeting in vegas. there were like 30 or so of us. he and i both stayed an extra day and walked around, talked, just enjoyed each other's company. after that we were seldom apart for more than a few days. he moved to my state,i moved to the city he moved to. we've been together just short of 20 years now, and 4 kids(2 from a previous marriage)are still crazy in love and i couldn't imagine anyone more perfect for me and our kids.
6562	28060	41	bqltzq	eo60vp9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	hmmm. my queer platonic partner met me in the comments of a youtube video because she recognized my username from reddit, does that count?
6563	28060	43	bqltzq	eo6186j	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	how do you even meet people on reddit? arent you all bots?
6564	28060	29	bqltzq	eo65r3n	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we are getting married tomorrow! we met when we were both going through a challenging time and became friends. eventually it evolved and i moved to be with him. we both thank our lucky stars for that chance encounter! we have been together for three years now and also just purchased a home! things are great right now!
6565	28060	13	bqltzq	eo66mtq	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met a very good friend on a small cancer sub about a year ago. we both had the same cancer and a lot of other uncannily coincidental things in common. talk every day now. /u/justpickedaname
6566	28060	11	bqltzq	eo6c8la	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on /r/r4r. i was looking to meet a girl and my so responded. she was local which was pretty cool and we sent long messages back and forth for a few days. i had not been having great experiences with my dates from okcupid and she mentioned she had some bad experiences dating too and she was just really looking for friends. i was kind of tired of the whole dating thing myself (it's super exuasting mentally and emotionally) so the just friends thing sounded pretty good to me. we started hanging out pretty regularly pretty soon after we met up. her best friend came along a lot too. we had a bunch of fun and where hanging out several times a week (which is a lot when you're a full time college student with a job and they live 50 minutes away). after about 3 or 4 months of casually hanging out we decided to go take a trip to a place 4 hours outside the city to go try out astrophotography. we did it twice within 2 weeks for a total of 16 hours of driving so we got to just talk a lot. we opened up with each other and shared a lot of personal stuff during the drives and really got to know each other on a more real level. i just remember on the way back from one of the trips after conversation had died down just sitting there and thinking how awesome she was and how much i liked her. about 2 or 3 weeks later we ended up officially dating and have been going strong for almost 3 years now. come to find out she was thinking the same thing during our star gazing trip. it was the moment we both knew we wanted each other. i just moved states for a job this weekend and she put in her 2 weeks notice last week and will be joining me in my new apartment very soon :).
6567	28060	12	bqltzq	eo759kn	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"a few years ago i was a moderator for a national subreddit. a most excellent dude (hi /u/jorgander ) posted a message saying ""i will be visiting your beautiful country later this year, do you guys want anything from the states?"" people made their requests, and some time later, the most excellent dude posts again, saying ""ok, i had a great time here, i am leaving today, and i want to drop off all the goodies you guys asked for."" the girlfriend of another mod and myself went there, let the most excellent dude know he was, in fact, a most excellent dude, picked up the loot (a huge bag, nearly broke my skinny back carrying it), divvied it up (we have a saying, he who shares gets a bigger share), and then i set up a meet to get everybody their stuff. as the meet began, it was the sausage party you'd expect from a reddit meet, and then *she* walks in. she had red hair and wore a star trek shirt. those were the first things i noticed about her. she noticed my dr who t-shirt. more people show up, beer is drunk, shit is shot, good times are had by all. the girl tells me she has to go, and i, despite being in a drunken stupor, go ""well it's raining, i have an umbrella, i'll walk you to a cab."" on the way to the cab, i tell her ""okay, gonna need to kiss you like, right now."" she goes ""damn, i've been dropping hints all evening."" lol wat. i haven't trained for this. anyway, that was seven years ago yesterday. two years ago today we were in church saying ""i do"", and today she's making french toast for the kid. that reddit meet led directly to the best days of my life."
6568	28060	10	bqltzq	eo63phv	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	its long distance, we met in a destiny lobby and she shouted at me for being a horrible warlock but then friended me afterwards. weve been a couple ever since. shes always part of my fire team. i still suck at warlock
6569	28060	39	bqltzq	eo65ap9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my bf of 5+ years on reddit through r/gonewild. i posted naughty pics (on a throw away account, so don't bother trying to scroll back in my post history, you'll be disappointed because its mostly animal crossing and pics of succulents) and he responded being funny and nice instead of ~~with a dick pic~~ sleazy/gross/objectifying. i replied back, and we chatted all night, learned we lived about an hour away from each other, eventually shared face pictures. in the morning i sent a video to his kik or whatsapp or whatever was the texting app of choice at the time saying my name, his name, and some specific detail we mentioned the night before to prove i wasn't a catfish. after two weeks of texting, we met up in person and have been dating ever since. moved in together two years ago. we had a friend who worked at reddit hq for a while, and he mentioned this story to alexis ohanian at some point, which he loved. we met him at a talk he did a while ago and asked if he would officiate our wedding and he agreed depending on his availability. i told him we're not engaged yet so our calendar is pretty flexible haha
6570	28060	12	bqltzq	eo6008i	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	upvoted cause im curious about this!
6571	28060	9	bqltzq	eo63ar3	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my girlfriend through a friend making subreddit roughly 2 years ago. we talked on and off again for about a year and then this past december we really got to know each other while we were both going through some shit. we met up irl at the end of april and started dating a few days later.
6572	28060	9	bqltzq	eo63f25	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met a guy on reddit that was looking for someone to play games with. we played some games and got along so we kept playing and chatting here and there. he always seemed a little off but it didn't affect anything as far as what we were doing so it was whatever. well one day we get to talking about our pets somehow and he just starts casually talking about how he adopts cats and if they aren't good enough for him he kills them for fun, survival of the fittest and all that. i told him he was fucked up and haven't talked to him since.
6573	28060	10	bqltzq	eo66h9h	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	almost a year ago i was in one of the darkest depressions of my life. i told the guy i was sort of dating at the time (he never called me his girlfriend because he wasnt ready) i was thinking pretty seriously about killing myself. i wasnt trying to play him for sympathy, but i was very afraid and never had such obsessive thoughts about it before. he was worried for maybe a day, then blew it off. one night i felt particularly low, and for the first time ever looked for someone online. i went through dozens of posts on a sub for people meeting each other and chatting using the app kik. i chose the one i felt was the most sincere, albeit a little sad, downloaded the app, and sent that person a message. 258 days later, that guy who didnt care about me has dumped me twice, and ive cut him out of my life. this stranger i met on reddit and started chatting with on kik is my whole support system. we talk everyday and all night. last week he flew across the country to meet me and my cats, and we had a blast together. when im sad, he always knows just what to say and i am no longer in that dark frightening pit. were there for each other. im there when he is sad too. we plays lots of games together, and now weve even done that in person! he reads to me sometimes (because hes very eloquent) and i can tell him all my secret. he likes to watch me draw sometimes when i work up the courage to do so. now i can say i have a boyfriend who loves me!
6574	28060	9	bqltzq	eo66ji5	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had a really terrible 2012 and in january 2013 thought fuck it, let's try online dating. tried match.com, eharmony, all of the basics. kept hitting steep paywalls or questionnaires that were unnecessary and uncomfortable. so i said fuck it, reddit's got to have an answer to this. and i found /r/r4r . i typed a quick post, exchanged messages with a lot of really weird people, and one stuck out. messaging on reddit turned into texting turned into skype turned into him driving 16 hours to northern minnesota in the dead of winter so we could meet. met on reddit in january, in person in march, i moved to him in september and we married in october. he is amazing. i don't want to embarrass him so i can't brag too much but i have an incredible husband and we have a great life together.
6575	28060	8	bqltzq	eo6r1h3	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	in december 2011, i got out of a. sub-optimal relationship, and i was looking for a new adventure. i posted on /r/idliketobeatree, a smallish community i'd found refuge in, saying i was taking a road trip from wichita to nyc, and that i'd like to meet up with people from the sub along the way. one person responded, and we met just outside of st. louis, mo. he was a mod of the subreddit, and we skyped a few times beforehand, so i found myself trusting him. found out he was moving to a town in kansas only a half hour away from me, and barely a month later we started a beautiful relationship, the best five years i've ever known. he showed me what it means to be truly good and kind. i'm so grateful i took a chance on a random sub.
6576	28060	8	bqltzq	eo5ugax	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i have met and made friends with multiple people on this website but never dated, sadly
6577	28060	7	bqltzq	eo69mgt	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we didn't exactly meet on reddit but i have gotten her on reddit now! we met on a site called emerald chat, she thought i was this young girl because of my personality. but our talk on the website was great, added each other in there, talked more. now we exchanged skypes and within 1 week of having each other on skype i told her that i loved her because i didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell my feelings for her, especially when you don't know what the next day entails for such a distance. i'm in the us and she's in malaysia so the time difference was massive and she's busy with university. we've had our ups and downs but we keep pushing through it. a year in i had the weird idea of giving her a middle name as malay's typically don't have middle names. so we went through some names and picked out one she likes, and she's absolutely in love with it now. the way she smiles when i refer to her as that name just makes my heart tick faster. i fall asleep in calls with her all the time and she puts up with it and finds it calming just watching me sleep, hell. before we were dating we fell asleep together in a voice call on skype. i can't say i regret because i don't. i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her. thanks for putting up with the flow of my short story. i know it's a bit chaotic.
6578	28060	8	bqltzq	eo6ae33	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	it was the midnight premier of the first avengers movie. a bunch of friends and i went to go see it. my theater was having a marathon of the movies before it, i decided i wanted to sneak in to see them. my friends did not so i went in to watch captain america alone. after a while they started texting me telling me that there was a girl sitting in front of them who had the exact same interests as me, doctor who, mlp, etc and i should come meet her. i was reluctant at first, but then they started calling me and i had to leave the theater. i met this girl, she was lovely, we traded numbers, and we've been together for 7 years now, got married almost two years ago
6579	28060	7	bqltzq	eo6ay8x	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was going to a university far away and posted on reddit about the hall i would be staying in. someone commented they were also staying in that hall. we chatted for a bit and then said we would see each other there. 4 months later after completely forgetting about this interaction i started dating this girl and about 2 weeks in she was talking about someone she has been trying to find in our hall who she talked to on reddit a few months ago. i connected the dots, brought up my comment history and asked her if that was her. so turns out, out of all 300 people i could have got with, i chose the one that i chatted to on a unanynous website without even knowing.

6582	28060	6	bqltzq	eo6p7cl	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i came across a comment where someone was talking about having published their book on amazon. since i'm always looking for book suggestions, i asked them if they could pm me their book link so i could check it out. after about a year of us spending time long distance and making trips to each other, she moved to where i live. i just proposed to her earlier this year and we get married in a few months!
6583	28060	7	bqltzq	eo77yf4	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"dec 2017, i moved in a new city, a university town in the middle of proverbial nowhere. it's a small city by my standards (population of 300k here vs the 5m tourist city where i just was vs the 13m capital city where i grew up). i don't speak the local language(s), the pocket community that does speak english are families and religious people, and had a hard time looking for my own crowd. i saw a thread talking about the city, someone said that ""so-and-so city is dank"" and i jumped ""where is the dankness,"" because the city is nothing but bars and sand and bars and more sand and sometimes camels (it's in the edge of the desert). before i arrived, i also made a similar post in the same sub before about what to do in the city. this guy pops in and suggests places to go to, then he messages me if we could hang out sometime. i've hung out with people from reddit before, they were mostly cool, so i was like, sure. he didn't know i was a girl. been dating ever since, moved in october last year, and he's a sweet, wonderful man who's probably reading this post in a few hours because we openly stalk each other's reddit profiles. ^^^^hey. ^^^^get ^^^^to ^^^^work."
6584	28060	26	bqltzq	eo5ymld	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	he messaged me after i posted something on a religious dating subreddit. we met up the next time he was in town and the rest is history! never met a guy like him in my life, let alone with the same values and stuff. its been about 8 months of long distance, but that will hopefully be changing really soon!
6585	28060	8	bqltzq	eo5ueoy	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met her after she moved away from my high school, how convenient right? we actually learned we had a lot in common and skyped and facetimed everyday and always talked about thing in life. that was freshman and sophomore year. finally she moved back because her dad found a new job here and we have officially started to be together. i couldnt think a week we havent spent together.
6586	28060	6	bqltzq	eo64fpc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my partner of five years here, i made a post looking for friends on r4r and he responded. we texted for a month or two then i went to seattle to meet him. at that point we started hanging out every so often as friends. eventually we moved to dating after we both realized we wanted more and now it's been over five years since we started officially dating. not a fairy tale love story but we work well together and he's the best thing to happen to me :)

6589	28060	6	bqltzq	eo68i8a	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	6 months ago, i went on a date with a girl i met on a dating app. she tells me that i remind her of one of her friends. she tells me that this friend is armenian, like me. she tells me her friend is into classic cars, like me. she sent me a photo of this beautiful 1967 chevy impala that belonged to her friend. she tells me ive got the same sense of humor as her friend. heck, she says if we dont work out, maybe ill set you up with her!. long story short, we didnt work out. one day, weeks after that date, im scrolling through r/classiccars. low and behold i see a photo of this gorgeous blue 1967 impala get posted. something about the photo sticks with me. it hits me that this is the exact same photo the girl sent me. im thinking no way! this has to be her armenian friend. i take a chance and send a pm to her. i was right, it was the same person i thought it was. she sent me her number to talk cars, and talk we did! turns out we have almost everything in common. we made each other laugh like crazy. we have the same sense of humor. were both artists in our own way. we both love classic muscle cars. we both love 90s music. we both basically have the same train of thought. she used to work at the company i work at now. were both in tech. we both struggled with past relationships. we send each other the exact same gifs at the same time. her weird is my kinda weird. we also both have insanely bushy armenian eyebrows (but she takes care of hers). we went on a date and within an hour, we were saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. seriously, at least once a day we say the same thing at the same time. weve been together ever since. i found my soul mate on reddit. i found my life partner. i found someone i never knew could be so incredible (and real) on reddit. so thank you reddit! and more importantly thank you u/youllregreddit for responding to a spontaneous, weird, anonymous message on reddit 6 months ago, and i cant wait for the rest of our lifetimes together!

(well, it was sunday 17th may 2015) i posted in our local sub in the april about a meetup and we ended up doing our own instead. 4 years later, we are amazingly happy. he lives with me and we just had a lovely day today with our blended family - my daughter, his son, his mum, and the two of us all sat outside in the garden having tea. we are so happy and grateful to reddit for bringing us together.
6591	28060	6	bqltzq	eo69hc9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my now husband on r/loseit in 2012. i was in the chat talking to everyone and happened to mention i was australian. husband said he loved utes and was obsesssed with holden cars. we struck up a friendship and spoke almost every day for years. i moved instate and the communication kinda died off. i was so upset by it but life was crazy for me and i was isolated from family and friends. in 2016 our communication started up again and i realised that what i had been feeling was more than just friendly feelings towards him. but how would it work? he was in florida and i was in australia. it seemed impossible. one night, we were having a deep and meaningful conversation and he told me he had feelings for me. i was so happy! i told him i absolutely felt the same and we decided we would do whatever it took to make this work. i met him in person in march 2017 when i flew over and spent a month with him. we were exactly the same in person as we were on skype/chat. he came to australia last year for two weeks and i got to show him the now closed holden factory and he got to hold a koala and feed kangaroos. it was so much fun. in july he proposed to me via video chat (which was perfect for my introverted self) and of course i said yes. we were married when i flew there for xmas last year and have now filed for the cr1 visa. the 16 month wait until we close the gap as begun!!!
6592	28060	6	bqltzq	eo6aedx	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met on /r/ohior4r. no lie, i was cruising for booty, she was looking for a hookup and casual dating. she made a post, i noticed it about a week after she posted but i figured i would try anyways. i pmed her and asked if she was still looking, she wrote back about an hour later saying she was. we got to texting, things got flirty, we exchanged some pictures and decided wed go out to dinner that night. dinner was great, full of great conversation. then we get done and i walk her to her car. we starting making out pretty hard and then she says, i guess i can take you home. we get to her place and instantly get into some hot and heavy sex. we ended up having sex four times that night, and we kept it up for the next month. after a month of wild sex and hanging out, we found out we had a ton of things in common. we started officially dating in may of 2015, and were still together now. in fact im going to propose to her this year.
