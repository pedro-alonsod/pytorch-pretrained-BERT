41759	616	bqg2xi	eo4anpx	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	there's nothing wrong with not liking to talk to people as long as you're friendly. don't force yourself to be talkative just because others want you to be. you'll still need to learn social skills like gauging trustworthiness, effective communication, and helpfulness. however, you don't need to force yourself to be talkative to be socially adept; you juat have to be mindful.
41759	26624	bqg2xi	eo49iqv	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	learn to say no, if a request makes you uncomfortable you can say no, even it's to family or friends! it's healthy to set boundaries and learn to respect others people's too :)

41759	25974	bqg2xi	eo47r35	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	if your parents are good people, you should try talking to them about your problems. don't let embarassment get in the way.

41759	6409	bqg2xi	eo49r29	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	delete your internet profiles every few years. your boss in 5 years does not want to see your shit from today, and we all post dumb shit. google yourself and make sure those accounts are deleted as well.
41759	8336	bqg2xi	eo470cq	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	that we love and care about them, i think we often get caught up in day-to-day life and forget to tell them this.
41759	1484	bqg2xi	eo4eeul	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	1. your emotions wont be this intense forever. but they are real and valid. my parents always invalidated my feelings  too dramatic, its just your hormones, youll grow out of it, you dont know how good you have it  while on some base level they possibly were right, it didnt mean my feelings werent real and intense in that moment. allow yourself to feel what you feel. but dont wallow or feed the depression kitty. it does get better. 2. if social media makes you feel shitty, just stop. it makes everyone feel shitty  even the people whose lives seem so much better and glamorous than yours. chances are, theyre posting that stuff to not feel shitty too. remember, everyone is posting their greatest hits. remember, everybody poops  even the girl posting glam pics from greece, she probably pooped right before or after the pic. point is, dont get wrapped up in that. take a month or two break from social media and see how you feel. 3. you dont have to go to college. and you also dont have to not go if you dont know what to do with your life. youll figure it out, maybe get inspired by your classes. and, as long as it will not launch you into a huge debt, it is ok to major in something you might not end up getting a career in. (to an extent). college is more than career training. its a much bigger learning experience about. everything! people, the world, yourself. dont dig a debt, work very hard, have lots of fun, and try to keep your eyes on a career path, but also absorb everything like a sponge. 4. i hated when people told me, you wont even miss high school when youre older. i did, for a little bit. and now, i really dont. as important as it is as a state of your pre-adulthood, in the big scheme of things, its just a tiny chapter. so dont get hung up on the mistakes you made or the drama you had. appreciate the experience for what it gave you, and move on. 5. lastly, and where i go all old lady, please put your phone away in the car. even at stoplights. just wait until you arrive. you may be super used to it, but it only takes one second of inattention to become potentially fatal. someone just died in my neighborhood for this very reason. sending a snap. it can wait. 6. (edit to add #6) teach yourself personal finance basics. your school and maybe parents probably neglected this, if times havent changed all that much. but. the internet is wonderful! you can teach yourself. take an edx or kahn or itunesu course. learn the basics and start saving. really truly understand student loans before taking them. and save. saving sounds like something you have plenty of time for later. when you make more money. but tomorrow never comes. learn and save now.

41759	10604	bqg2xi	eo47gpr	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	a lot of people try to glamorize high school and make you think your high school years are the best years of your life. for a lot of people, this just isn't true. it's okay not to like high school or to feel like you don't belong. you are not alone. it gets better. high schoolers deal with a lot of heavy shit. a lot of mental illness comes to light at this age, including depression and anxiety but also heavier stuff. many who struggle with these issues won't get help until years later. high school kids also deal with a lot of issues, like identity issues, bullying, pressure to conform, disputes with parents, the pressure associated with juggling work, school and life that often get better once high school is done. hang in there, it does get better.
41759	5920	bqg2xi	eo49ny3	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	that we miss you & we actually want to spend time with you, not because of how you were (our little boy/girl) but because we are in awe of who you are and want to get to know you better, so you know we love you unconditionally but also that its ok and fun to hang out sometimes; soon youll be leaving home, time passes quickly, and we want to create as many good memories as we can for you so you can use them for when the world is not so kind and im not around to give you a hug. youre amazing, youve always been and i know your life will be filled with ups and downs but i hope the love we share reminds you that youll always have a soft spot to land edit: note: thank you so much for your comments, i wish i could hug you all. thank you to those who granted me awards, i never thought an open letter to my son would move so many.i actually showed this to him, we both cried, hugged and laughed but most importantly and thanks to all of you i just became way cooler! im sorry for those of you who did not have a great upbringing, i didnt either, thats why youll be, just like me, especially careful with your kids emotional well-being, because after all, its their story in the making. edit 2: wow. dear reddit community, i want to share something with you: my son and i have read each one of your comments, i cannot express how this has been a deeply moving experience and that your words mean a lot to us. if you didnt have love and support growing up, i hear you, i do; its up to you now to give it, itll free you from the constrains of being hurt by the lacking. you dont have to be a parent, sometimes we choose our family, and love knows no titles, i have learned that by constantly feeling that love above all, hard moments and little (or big) grudges have the space to be felt and transform themselves into growing opportunities so we can, of course, love ourselves and others. my son sits here with me and we have had so many conversations because of your words, all of you are important in my book, youve made a huge difference today to this random family, irl.

41759	604	bqg2xi	eo4e4dh	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	be calm when arguing your point of view. accept criticism, shrug off the type of personal attacks and ad hominems that don't contribute to the debate. and don't measure how right you are by number of upvotes or downvotes.
41759	22090	bqg2xi	eo48uev	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	just because you pop out a baby doesn't mean it'll keep your so around and at times it'll make them break up with you. to that part, just because you have the kid doesn't mean it'll unconditionally love you, especially when you're a shitty parent. these are things my idiotic friends had made when we were young, choosing to get knocked up at a wrong time in life has shaken lives to rubble at points.
41759	8859	bqg2xi	eo48b59	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	build good health habits now. if you're not already active, find a simple active hobby you can do. take up pokemon go or take up bike riding or something. also, learn how to cook some basic and healthy meals like chicken pesto pasta or fried rice. the healthier you are as a teen the easier it is to stay healthy as an adult. edit: my food options seem super controversial, like portion control and different recipes aren't a thing. but here's a recipe that's super simple, fairly healthy, takes about 5-10 minutes and anyone can do. buy some bagged lettuce, or like 2-3 different kinds of lettuce if you can get the fresh stuff. take a cucumber grab some olives or carrots or whatever else you like. snag some feta cheese. fry up a small amount of minced turkey (i get that everyone hates fried food, but again, proportions are key). put lettuce in bowl, slice up as much cucumber as you want, add that to bowl, cut up carrots, add to bowl, same with olives and extra veggies. put in the small amount of turkey (like 100g is enough) and crumble a small amount of feta on top (feta has a strong flavor so you always need less than you think you do). it makes a really delicious salad that fills you up for hours. turkey is also naturally flavorful when fried like that so you can add spices or not and it's still fine.
41759	12673	bqg2xi	eo47127	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	1) work on improving yourself and your interests now, it will set you up for more success later and likely will attract others to you.2) none of social-structure/drama shit is going to matter once you're out of school so don't worry about what others think, you just do you. 3) . . its completely legal for a teenager to buy all the equipment and ingredients to make beer, just saying.
41759	440	bqg2xi	eo4ctdy	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	go ahead and be rebellious, it's part of growing up. but please be safe while you are doing it! use the condom, don't depend on your date for transportation until you know them, tell someone where you are so we know how to get to you in an emergency, keep your phone charged, ask for help if needed.

41759	1250	bqg2xi	eo464e4	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	**it's okay to not have a plan yet.** *edit, to clarify, i think you should have at least loose goals, something (anything) you're working toward, otherwise you'll go nowhere. but the plan to get there doesn't have to be well thought out yet, you definitely don't have to have to know all the details at this point, and you certainly shouldn't beat yourself up or stress out. **edit: thanks to /u/drgrabass for making me make this at least moderately more useful advice.
41759	600	bqg2xi	eo46raa	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	right now you have options, figure out what you want, every bill you get, every responsibility you add to you life takes away options. eventually people have all these bills and kids and marriages or whatever, but its all responsibilitys that you are going to have. it might take a few years to figure out , no big deal. just dont go buy that new car because you want to be cool, you just took away a little bit of freedom. live free now, you have very few responsibilities. do all the crazy dumb shit, fail at business. we need more entrepreneurs, do it and fail now. because when your 30 with a family and career and you didnt take that chance when you were a teen (early 20s) it will dig at you every day.
41759	1869	bqg2xi	eo46gst	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"when i was teenager i was going through a really rough patch where i felt i might have depression. i didn't know who to talk to, so i thought i'd ask my doctor about it. i told him i thought i might be depressed and asked if he had any suggestions on what to do. he laughed at me and said, ""you're not depressed, you're just a teenager."" i never went back to that doctor again, but i also didn't open up to anyone about the way i felt again. i went though a really self-destructive peoriod following that using drugs, alcohol, and self-harm to cope and about to flunk out my school, which was one of the best private schools in the city. i was at a real low point and one night when i was set on killing myself, my dog snoopy convinced me not to and made me want to try and get better. i finally decided to try and get some help again and after i did i wished i had done it sooner. my point is don't be afraid to ask others for help. wanting to better your mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, even if it might feel that way."
41759	982	bqg2xi	eo48se5	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	calm down. you don't need to know what you want to do with the rest of your life right now. take your time and look at many different avenues

41759	419	bqg2xi	eo49rwn	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	gain more life experience before considering children.(or even chancing it for that matter.) having a child when you're too young or inexperienced robs the baby of much needed stability and direction. an education, halfway decent job and a general understanding of life is highly recommend. source: became a father at a young age, no formal education, had a 17k/year job(at the time) and was in an otherwise unhappy relationship with the mother. note: she wasn't planned nor is she regretted, she forced me to grow tf up, step out of my comfort zone and land an actual job that can pay the bills.
41759	518	bqg2xi	eo4dtf3	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	wear sunscreen. im not a parent but im 24 and ive always worn sunscreen, and its crazy how my friends the same age who didnt wear all have wrinkles already and look much older than they are

41759	219	bqg2xi	eo4hnzg	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	if you want to go to college, see about getting it done with just as little debt as possible. two years in community college is a good if not ideal start.

41759	425	bqg2xi	eo4a2ey	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	as a mom, and a former teen, sometimes life just sucks, and it feels like it will never get better, but often times the suckiness is temporary. it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but maybe there is a bend in the path that is keeping the light from you. keep going till you get some agency and can make your own decisions and choices for what your life looks like. when i was 14 i really wanted to die. i was bullied and i felt unimportant in my family. i was ready to commit suicide, but i somehow talked myself into waiting until i was an adult. thank goodness i waited, life has been 1000% better and different from how i expected. i still occasionally get twinges of depression, but i get through in increments of 15 minutes at a time. you have value. you are worthy. you are loved.

41759	67	bqg2xi	eo4qc4t	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	disclaimer: not a parent. * don't smoke cigarettes. holy shit, i started at 15 and couldn't come to a full stop until i was 24. it might take some stress off or seem like a really easy way to socialize with people, but it's just a crutch. * use moderation in everything; don't get mixed up in addictive substances. there is absolutely such a thing as a psychological addition to substances that aren't physically addictive. just because weed won't kill you and doesn't create physical addiction, doesn't mean you can't become psychologically addicted to it. what do you think is the hardest part about quitting cigarettes? from my experience, most addicts will tell you that it's the routine. same thing applies to pot. if you're going to smoke pot, use moderation. is what you're considering taking physically addictive? pull your shit together and don't get involved in it. * fuck who you want (you know, with mutual consent and all), but use condoms. use condoms. use condoms you daft shit. * she/you is/are on birth control? congrats, use a condom. 100% of post-nut clarity will tell you that you're not at a time in your life to even risk having kids. * he/she's totally clean? definitely use a condom. guess what? they tell everyone they're clean, which means they're not using condoms with other people and probably have no fucking idea whether they're actually clean. the only exception to this should be long-term relationships after extremely careful consideration by both you and your partner. still, ymmv. be warned. * also, condoms don't fully protect against herpes. * actually pay attention in class. i spent so much time dicking around and looking for ways to burn time before the bell; i missed out on so much as a result. i'll never give a fuck about the memes i was browsing in my dc calculus class, but i definitely gave a fuck when i was in college level calculus classes and didn't remember the subject foundations that i should have established earlier on. additionally, paying attention is just a good habit. you might not give a fuck about the subject, but high school is most important in teaching you *how* to learn complex(ish) topics. it's a skill that you'll need no matter where you go in life. * don't make life decisions based on your high school paramore. for fucks sake, neither of your brains have fully developed. neither of you have any idea how the other will turn out in two, five, or ten years. i went from being some burnout stoner in the bottom third of my high school class to a law student who graduated with honors and an academic publication. some of the smartest people i knew fell off the deep end and never left their parents' houses, despite having every opportunity in the world to do so. * learn how to cut out the toxic people in your life. it might take time and patience, and a little finesse, but it's a thing i wish i'd learned to do before my early-mid twenties. you'll be a hundred times happier for it. * if you go to college, major in something marketable. minor in whatever the fuck you enjoy. don't flush 100k down the drain for an art history degree. * on that note, if you're planning on going to college, start applying for scholarships early. even if you're extremely fortunate and your family is covering your tuition, start applying for scholarships. student loans may seem like some distant problem, but you'll curse the ever loving fuck out of your past (current) self if you don't start taking some steps to mitigate needing loans. * if your family is covering your tuition through a 529 plan, whatever is leftover goes to you at the end of college. build a huge cushion with scholarships and be ahead of the curve in savings when you graduate. * finally, you're about to learn that time flies. you think you know now? it gets worse. it feels like last month that i left home to start college. that was seven years ago. enjoy every day. enjoy living with your parents and having stupid rules to follow. enjoy riding your crappy bike and working at that crappy pizza joint. enjoy that boring day with your friends where you're all sitting around with no idea what to do. one day, that's all going to go away. it's all going to be a memory as you shuffle through the increasingly complex and challenging world of adulthood. make no mistake, it's still exciting and you'll have more memories to make, but the ones you make today? make them fond.

"learn the art of conversation. before you are an adult embarrassing yourself in front of smart, considerate adults conversation skills include: 1. stop with the constant ""facts"". unless what you are quoting is a paper with cited sources and you are talking with other experts in said field. otherwise you come off as a fake know it all who knows nothing but what they read on the internet. people see through that shit and it's annoying to say the least. 2. it is not a conversation if you are not asking questions. it's just you talking and holding another hostage. also, they aren't listening 3. take time to think about what is being said by someone other than you. waiting for your turn to talk is also not a conversation 4. interrupting. it's okay to be excited and some people's conversation is more interrupty than other's, but be mindful 5. know your audience. conversation can quickly turn into arguing. so if it's conversation you're going for, read the crowd and avoid escalation to sum it up don't be a dick"

41759	52	bqg2xi	eo4hvkx	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	you're not imagining it -- being a teenager is really f***ing hard, and a lot of adults forget that. but that does not give you an excuse to be such a little sh*t
41759	16	bqg2xi	eo4f304	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"independence is a natural and desirable outcome of growing up. my job as a parent in my opinion is in large part to make my daughters gradually more independent so that by the time they leave the nest they can take care of themselves. you don't have to ""rebel"" to achieve this, unless your parents are stalling your normal development. as an aside i don't really get helicopter or smothering parents who micromanage their kids. things are far easier when kids can take care of themselves, less work for the parent and also in the long run its far better for the kid. them taking care of themselves and making there own decisions is kind of the idea behind raising them in the first place, so i don't really get overbearing parents who drive themselves and often their kids nuts with all that nervous controlling energy."
41759	46	bqg2xi	eo4ff7l	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	you guys are awesome. ive been in education for 24 years and overall, teenagers today are so much more accepting, affirming, and supportive than theyve ever been. im so proud of how you guys stick up for kids with disabilities, kids who are different, or just the underdog. your generation gets so much undeserved crap, but you just keep on being great.
41759	49	bqg2xi	eo4gx78	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	don't be afraid to approach and talk to someone you find attractive. they're most likely just as shy as you. it's also a numbers game. the more you put yourself out there, the more you'll get comfortable and great at starting small talk (which is also helpful later during job interviews) leading to more dates. or hook-ups ;) one last thing, fake confidence works. you may be dying on the inside but keep your poker face and no one will ever know!!
47462	7538	brzuwa	eohvxz4	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	as someone who struggles with ptsd, i would like to say that i don't choose to be as repetitive and exhausting as i can be. i will react the same way to the same situation because that is an association that has been with me for half my life. it's very difficult to keep opening up to friends without feeling like a burden because you cannot cope with the same thing as last week. they have heard me talk about it so often and given me several pieces of advice on it and i hate feeling like this broken record, but to me that is a core part of this disorder. edit: obligatory thanks for the first reddit gold! also, thank you so much for your responses. i've been reading all of them during breaks and try to respond here and there.
47462	12549	brzuwa	eohv7cx	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	we know we are acting irrational, but its not something we could help. especially if its something like ptsd or anxiety. somedays are just harder than others, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying. just being their for us is enough and we appreciate it so much.
47462	34601	brzuwa	eohv74z	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	something to help with the stigma? most people don't see mental illness until it has manifested itself outwardly. you know, the homeless guy yelling at a trash can type of thing. realize that you are looking at the extreme end, thinking that is what mental illness is, is like thinking someone with 90% of their skin scorched off is what a burn looks like.
47462	611	brzuwa	eohvp69	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	physical therapy is seen as a regular part of recovery from of any serious injury. theres no stigma attached for someone in a cast or a wheelchair to see a physical therapist. mental health counseling should be considered in the same light.
47462	9932	brzuwa	eohvbiv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	as someone with bipolar, i always compare it to diabetes. it's a lifelong condition, usually managed by medication though occasionally people manage without. the medication isn't always perfect, so you have to let those around you know the warning signs. if you ignore / stop taking your meds suddenly, you will have serious problems and may embarrass yourself in public. sadly, i've recently had to add an extra section to my explanation as part of an apology. if you're a diabetic in hospital waiting for your foot to be amputated, even if you took your meds perfectly, you get limited sympathy if you spent every weekend stuffing yourself with cake. for bipolar, the equivalent tends to be booze / drugs, and god damn is the level of substance abuse high amongst us.
47462	2289	brzuwa	eohv2ny	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	adhd exist. its not just being hyper or a condition therapists invented. if i was diagnosed as a kid i might have gotten on my meds sooner and finish high school.
47462	5904	brzuwa	eohuzdv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	we know that sometimes you don't understand us, but please consider that sometimes we don't understand either. as hard as it is for you, imagine how hard it is for the person suffering through it. i don't know why i have to flatten out every single wrinkle in the sheet before i sleep, and i know my boyfriend is tired and wants to go to bed too, but if i don't, i won't be able to sleep and will be itchy all night. we're doing our best, please just be patient with us.

47462	8394	brzuwa	eohv3lc	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you cant just tell a depressed person to go out and talk to people and have some fun. depression kills the will to do anything.
47462	1186	brzuwa	eohuxoq	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	it hurts to know that you can't trust anyone. you nevet know when someone is going to sell your secrets and tell everyone about that one thing you did when you were extremely ill just for some karma. you hear stories of crazy people doing weird things and know that some day you might be the crazy person people talk about for morbidness. and to get better you always need to trust nurses and doctors, and yourself. and that's hard to do when you're seen as an anecdote and not as a person.
47462	798	brzuwa	eohxyzv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	please dont ridicule me for my coping mechanisms. i like to colour to help ignore thoughts. if im doing that instead of due tasks then im really struggling.
47462	10206	brzuwa	eohv1ma	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	intrusive thoughts are exactly that. intrusive. the amount of times people have told me to just shrug it off or not think about it is annoying. edit: i've been asked for an example so i'll share my personal experience. what a lot of people seem to misunderstand is that most of the time they aren't traditional thoughts. they are commands your brain tries to issue and you have to mentally block them and stop them from occuring. having to constantly stop yourself from hacking someone with a cleaver or shoving a glass in someone's face really messes with your day. sometimes you just can't function properly and it really messes with your head to constantly deal with that kind of stress on top of living a normal life. edit 2: for people asking how i cope. first of all knowledge about the condition is the best thing you can acquire to combat it. once you know why things are happening you can deal with them. on top of that i have a meditative coping strategy for when it gets paticularly bad in inconvenient situations. i know it sounds silly but i'll take 10 seconds or so, imagine a wall with an iron bolted door in my head and forcefully lock that 'version' of myself in there. then i'll squash it, like the trash compactor from star wars . coupled with this i have a great doctor and some medication which really helps keep it under control. the final thing is more of a lifestyle change. i keep a strict exercise schedule and weekday routine which is more important to me than a lot of things in my life. it reminds me that i'm in control and my discipline won't falter. hope this helps someone!
47462	6479	brzuwa	eohuqrn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you're dealing with people who are essentially running with one leg in a two legged race. the bar for success for the mentally ill is much different than everyone else. for instance, someone suffering from severe depression making it to old age is sometimes a great feat. it certainly kills many before they get there. edit: to all of you who have replied and i cannot answer, cheers to you for getting up and doing what you need to do to get through another day. i know it's hard. i know it's thankless. i know it seems pointless, but you've achieved more than you think and can keep achieving more. congratulations on what you've accomplished so far!
47462	1107	brzuwa	eohx66o	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	just because someone looks okay doesn't mean they are okay. i have a full time job. i have a house. i have a decent wage and i'm doing okay for my age. i also have borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, possibly ptsd, and traits of other personality disorders. i appear to function on the outside, but inside i struggle every day. i co-own my house with my dad, and despite living with me even he thinks i'm okay. people who are suffering often bottle it up in an attempt to not be a burden or to just try and get on with life, but it wears them down. reach out to your friends and ask how they are. let them know you're there for them. and if they disclose they have a certain disorder, do a little research think about how it affects them rather than how it affects you. you can't make them talk to you but you can show them you're there.

47462	3005	brzuwa	eohuq0p	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	therapy isn't only for the mentally ill, nor is it a cash grab. therapy works. not every therapist's the same either, so while some may not work for you, others will. therapy works. edit: wow, first gold!! thank you so much!!
47462	117	brzuwa	eohza0d	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i cant answer the phone. cant drive the car sometimes, even for groceries or prescriptions. cant go to sleep. cant deal with criticism. its like entropy, a small thing grows all on its own into an unrelated mess of disorganized anger and frustration often over nothing tangibly real. but its so real to me. it becomes panic. or anger at myself. to combat this i feel the need to be perfect, constantly. you could consider this a benefit, i often out perform my peers. but if i fail, even a little, im a failure to myself. i lost a hat in january and im still punishing myself for it. so to you, on the outside, i do everything right and that makes you think im okay, annoying even. i make good enough money and im successful in my field. but the moment im alone i pull the skin off my scalp with my fingernails and have almost no close relationships. i cant control how i feel. i know its not normal, but i know i do everything i can to try to cope. i probably didnt answer the question but thats the adhd.

"yes, i hallucinate. yes, i have voices in my head. yes, i'm not exactly completely sane, but that does not mean i can't function. i can still hold conversations, i can still hold relationships, i can still be relatively stable in public. also, i am not my mental illness. do not see me as, ""that depressed kid"", see me for who i am. there is so much more to a person than their mental state. and mental illness can affect anyone. age, race and gender have nothing to do with it (except for gender dysphoria). a four year old can experience ptsd and so can a thirty year old. it's all about environment."
47462	563	brzuwa	eohy99j	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i know i overreact, i know im too sensitive, i know i make things difficult. i know all of these things make you uncomfortable and inconvenience you but maybe just take a second to think about how much they affect me.
47462	782	brzuwa	eohut24	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"talk about it. suicide is the second most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, so they are a big clientele to reach. but also middle-aged people are at high risk, especially men. you can share articles that talk positively about mental illness and recovery, along with being active in foundations for suicide prevention like the [afsp in the us](https://afsp.org/take-action/), the [nspa in uk](https://www.nspa.org.uk/) or whichever it is in your country. most importantly, if you know someone who is feeling down or has suicidal thoughts, the best thing you can do to help is listen and ask directly ""do you have suicidal thoughts?"". this leaves them with a simple yes or no question, so they aren't the one who have to ""say it out loud"". don't panic when someone says ""yes""! you can have suicidal thoughts without wanting to actively take your life,; they are a coping mechanism for underlying issues. if you think you can handle it, ask how persistent they are, if they can distance themselves from those thoughts or if they have a plan on how to take their life. make sure to use the word ""suicide"" or any phrases without a negative connotation (see: ""killing yourself""). **don't** give advice: just actively listen and comfort them in a way that doesn't make them feel trivialized or judged. staying away from any moral judgements (regarding their feelings) is very important! also, you can offer to support them when they plan to get treatment, like accompanying them when going to the doctor, figuring out who to call and so on. there are also some chat or mail-based counceling options if speaking in person or on the phone is too much for them. edit: clarified some points, different wording"

47462	364	brzuwa	eohvrf2	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would say the prevalence of antagonist characters that have a (usually misrepresented or grossly inaccurate) mental health issue is a problem. same for a lot of true crime documentaries and the like, where they speculate on whether the perpetrator might have had some kind of mental illness without explaining the illness correctly, or write off a person's actions as being down to the effects of the mental illness. i can tell if someone has been influenced by this kind of shitty pop culture by the way they look at me and others. no, being bipolar does not mean i might murder you for no logical reason. in fact, it makes me statistically more likely to be murdered or a victim of abuse.
47462	278	brzuwa	eohv85g	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	everyone is unique and so is their experience with mental illness. no two people with depression will experience the same thing nor will two people with anxiety react the same way to the same things.
47462	91	brzuwa	eohv8hk	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would like to say how wonderful my patients have been. most people are just looking for help and support on their way to recovery, like you would do with any physical illness. i mainly work with schizophrenia patients, and i am lucky to have met a whole variety of people from different backgrounds, with different interests and hobbies, who go about their lives like everyone else, just with a few more difficulties along the way! stigma is still real, despite the 'awareness' campaigns. i suppose it's best to remember that people with every type of mental health 'disorder' live by your side, they may be your neighbour, your teacher, your employee, your friend. don't isolate these people from society, help them by creating opportunities for them to join in! if you are in the uk at the moment there has been a good series of mental health documentaries that you can watch on iplayer. including 'psychosis and me', 'anxiety and me', and 'depression and me'. as well as the latest from louis theroux, i highly recommend you check them out.
47462	4488	brzuwa	eohu0mm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	we literally have no control over what our mind is doing, feeling, or how its going to react to anything. there is zero control. be understanding that this is much harder for the sufferer than it is for you. your brain is an organ and like any other organ it can get sick or weakened or simply not work as strongly or efficiently as it used to. you wouldnt expect someone to just get over or snap out of a heart attack or kidney failure. its unfair to expect the same of mental illness. edit because this got a lot more popular than i ever expected. while most people are agreeing with me, some seem to think im being damaging in what i say so ill make it clear. what goes on in our mind we cannot control. the thoughts, compulsions, panics that just appear we cannot preempt or stop. we *all* can, however, work hard to recover. we can seek help, get medicine, use coping mechanisms that will help us control how we act and react. but nobody can ever convince me we can just stop thinking the things that pop into our brains.

47462	121	brzuwa	eohuuf5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	people are coping the best way they can based on their experience. for example, someone who yells and turns people away can just be trying to comfort themselves based on past experience of letting someone in and being hurt by it. treatment is about learning new coping skills that will give people comfort that also gives them other things they need in their life (relationships, stability, etc.)
47462	433	brzuwa	eohw6pw	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i know this isn't exactly what your asking for, but as someone who works in mental health, has suffered from mental health issues and has witnessed some of the effects. get. off. social. media. reddit isn't too bad because it isn't tied to your personality and identity. but get off instagram, facebook, snapchat and any other media that is linked to your real identity and self worth. those platforms are directly responsible for more harm to young people's mental health than everything else combined. i know of multiple suicides, attempted suicides and self harm cases that are a result of interaction on social media. i work in the nhs and we can't keep up with all the depressed teenagers that come in with depression and anxiety brought on by social media use. this in turn is stopping us from treating serious cases of mental illness. every single young person who has deleted their social media accounts on professional advice (in my service) has immediately felt a significant improvement in their mental health, their self worth and a reduction in their anxiety. please, if you do nothing else this year. delete your social media apps, wait for the withdrawal to wear off and feel the freedom that comes with not feeling like your whole life is on show and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone. edit 1: under no circumstances should you feel like you are taking up a professionals time. i know i said we're overloaded, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help. definitely seek help if you feel like you aren't coping. edit 2: if you have a healthy relationship with social media then that's great, but if logging into instagram has you feeling fat, worthless, boring, ugly, poor, stupid, or any other negative feeling. delete it. cheers for the silver. well shit. gold too. thanks a bunch.

"as much as i wouldn't wish my mental illnesses on anyone, there have been many times i wish someone could live in my head for just one day. the constant thoughts of ways and planning and just running thoughts of suicide and anxiety about the simplest of things is so very exhausting. and as much as i would love to ""just get over it"", it takes a lot of work to feel like what i imagine a ""normal"" person must feel like. also, i need those meds just as much as a person with heart disease or other chronic illness needs theirs. i cannot function without them and therapy. stop saying i don't need them!!"
47462	55	brzuwa	eoi3wo2	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	suicide isnt an 'egoistic' choice. if a severely depressed person comitted suicide, he/she did it because they felt that the people left behind would do much better without them. they actually commit suicide to help relatives and loved ones.
47462	158	brzuwa	eohvxd5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	bpd is not inherently abusive, and people with it can be good people and live normal lives. on that vein, not everyone who acts irrationally/in a way that offends your sensabilities will have bpd, and if you know someone with bpd who acts a certain way, thats likely not universal. just dont stigmatise and overgeneralise.

"we don't choose to act this way for ""attention"" or because we ""want to"". i didn't choose ect because i felt like it. i want to be able to get up and do things like work, go to school, start my life but i can't. we have empathy for people if they broke their leg, why is it not the same for mental health? also stop romanticizing it; suicide is not ""cute"" or ""cool"" (i'm looking at you 13 reasons why). also: mental health is not just depression or anxiety. there is lots that don't get brought up like schizophrenia, bi-polar. way more than i can think of. here is a list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mental_disorders source: 26 (turning 27) year-old on disability due to depression, anxiety, and ptsd. did six rounds of ect. was diagnosed with my mental health issues ~10 years ago now."
47462	92	brzuwa	eohw6dm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i want people to know that wrong treatment and diagnonsis can set back a person's recovery by years! there is nothing wrong about not having chemistry with your therapist and finding someone better suited to help you. my battle lasted for years and nearly killed me. i spent more time in hospitals than at home. pushed back and forth to different facilities cause nobody would take responsibility. i was stuck. then one day one of the chief doctors decided to send me the fuck away to another district and everything changed. they gave me time. we spent 6 monts doing tests. new diagnoses, right diagnosis. today: no self harm, no episodes no hospitals for 9 years. i was the patient they thought would die in the system. or to selfharm, or suicide. i was that patient. and by that you all know what that means. the point in all of this is: get proper treatment. never give up. never stop fighting for your right to be better, to get the help you need. cause it will get better. dont settle no matter how hopeless it is. wrong diagnosis and medication matters more than you think. i believe in you.

"i am bipolar. people don't know how to react when you tell them you're ill. which i understand of course. we talk a lot about people that are mean or treat you like you're crazy and stuff. it sucks obviously but we talk so much about them that we forget about the other side of the coin. when people are too benevolent or sympathetic, they can also cause damages. i am surrounded by friends and by my family and they all support me which is great and i'm very greatful for that. but sometimes (or always) they have absolutely no idea what to say but feel like they must say something no matter what. they usually try to reassure you but doing this they just get the opposite reaction. i call it minimization. basically, they tell you not to worry, what you're experiencing isn't that bad don't be afraid, they also feel like this sometimes it's gonna be fine stop. doing. this. it's the worst. imagine you feel like shit or that something's reaaally wrong and you're afraid, and then someone tells you ""meh it's okay everybody have ups and downs ;)"". all my friends and my family (except my sister) do that. now everytime i fell like something's happening, i'm asking myself ""do i really need to see my doctor? is there really something wrong? am i faking it?"". so yeah, not useful at all, i'd rather be told to worry so i can get some help instead of keeping it to myself. also it's painful and really annoying so now i just don't talk to anybody at all, except my sister. what does she do ? what do i personally want people to do ? just listen to my rants or worries or news from my doctors, but don't say anything. accept that you will never understand it so don't try to give advice, judge (yeah some friends told my i take too much meds and that they worry), relate, reassure, etc. i just need a shoulder to cry on and that's it. the only people that i will listen to are my doctors, and that's it. it's my personnal situation so maybe other will disagree with me."
47462	195	brzuwa	eohuqio	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"mental illness can happen to anyone, literally. it's as common as physical illnesses like the common cold. part of removing the stigma is to talk more openly about it, to stop the whole ""hush-hush, behind closed doors"" thing. anxiety and depression are among the most common, and lately i've seen a rise in eating disorders (looking at you, influencers who promote body dysmorphia with plastic surgery they claim is achievable with diet and exercise, and especially influencers who push intense diets and weight loss products. you are literally causing damage to people with your pursuit of fame and money). bipolar, schizophrenia and personality disorders are treatable. they're not something to fear. important to note too, that personality disorders can be incredibly mild, and don't necessarily need treatment unless it impacts your life negatively."
47462	125	brzuwa	eohvlvq	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"there is literally nothing wrong with having to take medication for a mental illness. it doesn't mean you're creating ""artificial happiness"" or a dependency issue. you're correcting your brain's shortcomings with the resources that you have available. we do what we have to do to improve our mental health"
47462	479	brzuwa	eohv2g3	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"you are not ""a bit ocd"". you might be pedantic or fussy about things, you might even get obsessive, but just liking things to be generally neat and tidy and done properly is not ocd. you can't 'be' a disorder, anyway! obsessive compulsive disorder can be completely debilitating for people who live with it, and folks going about saying ""omg i'm *sooo* ocd!"" completely trivialise sufferers' struggles and the shit they have to deal with in their heads. someone is far less likely to open up about their compulsions if they think the people around them will dismiss the issue - or even mock them for it. acknowledge that you're fussy, sure, but please don't tell people that you're ""totally ocd"" about things."
47462	673	brzuwa	eohtyve	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	not a mental health worker but i wish people would stop saying all this horrible stuff about autism
47462	37	brzuwa	eohwqzm	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i think my concussions have fucked me up permanently. i grew up playing hockey every day for 15 years, trying to make the nhl. but after being knocked unconscious for the 10th time something. changed. my long term memory is non existent, im very irritable and depressed. i cant look people in the eyes anymore. i went from social butterfly to a compete hermit shut in that cant bare being in public. are these things correlated? my parents refuse to believe they are and they think im being dramatic. im not. i think about suicide on a daily basis. i was *never* like this until my last violent head trauma. ive probably had over 25 instances of severe head trauma (*at least*), i only know for sure of the ones where i was knocked out cold.
47462	37	brzuwa	eohwtu1	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"as someone who suffers from schizophrenia, one thing that i hear the most is """"shouldn't you be locked up?"" . seriously people? i thought society has moved past the point where psychopaths in horror movies represent what a disorder is actually like. no, i will not murder your child. no, i will not commit any other crime you might be thinking of right now. relax, we aren't as dangerous as you think. in fact, we aren't that dangerous at all ( most of the time. ) why not give me a goddamn chance?"
47462	67	brzuwa	eohvgef	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you wish to understand someone with a mental health condition please educate yourself and research the condition. i have a lot of people who claim to know and try to give advice. once you've worked with professionals the average persons advice can become awkward and patronising at times. learn before you weigh in. it's a very sensitive subject and would go some way to lessening the stigma if more people educated themselves.
47462	129	brzuwa	eohvm2j	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	dont stray away from a person if they confessed their struggles to you. theyre probably in a very difficult situation and trust you enough to tell you about it. you should get informed about their mental illness and try to fix it with them. or just be supportive at least or get someone who can help more than you involved but i just beg you dont under any circumstances stray away from them

47462	55	brzuwa	eoi1fug	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	anorexia is not a disorder of vanity. i have this disease and am also doing my phd on perceptions of eating disorders. eating disorders are so incredibly complex, yes they are a disorder of control, but it goes deeper. as a start, if i could change one thing tomorrow or would be the normalisation of commenting on peoples weight. also, you cant simply assume the severity of this condition by a persons weight. eds come in many forms, a lot of sufferers dont look like the media-depicted version of anorexia. be gentle on us and put down your assumptions.
47462	25	brzuwa	eohvxnu	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i try my hardest. but sleep overtakes me. i cant stop it. im tired 24/7. i want to be outside. i want to go out and do things. but i cant leave the bed without all my willpower.
47462	29	brzuwa	eohw4hv	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i was diagnosed with bipolar-ii disorder and depression about two years ago, which to me, was a relief. until that point, people close to me would sometimes point out that i seemed to be out of it. i'd be extremely emotional, unable to focus, and paranoid (to a lesser degree than the other two, but still). over time, i had become desensitized to these things and they became my new normal. after starting medication, then forgetting to take it, followed by a short involuntary commitment to the local hospital, and then constant and proper use of my medication, it hit me. before seeking treatment, i just didn't know anything was wrong. my point is we often don't know something is going on until others point the signs out to us. i sure as hell didn't. nowadays, i'm doing much better! the depression is under control and the bipolar-ii stuff is mostly controlled. i do have manic episodes once in a while, but it's usually just me starting to write about stuff and becoming bored. the depressive episodes don't happen anymore. yay! i'm starting my senior year at the local university in august, so everything is looking good from here. maybe i'll meet someone and end up with a girlfriend. who knows? so yeah, look out for the people you are close to. you might be the first one to pick up on something.
47462	28	brzuwa	eohy2ap	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	those struggling are often experts at hiding it. just like how it's extremely hard to spot someone drowning in a crowded pool, it's almost impossible to know who of your friends, family and peers is struggling with their mental health if they don't tell you. i can guarantee you that you personally know at least one person struggling with their mental health. if you don't know who it is, they are trying so hard to hide their issues because they are scared of how you (or others) will react. you might have spoken to them about their very issues (maybe even in a negative way) and never knew you were directly addressing them. mental health isn't padded rooms and strait jackets, it's real people with real issues. there should be no stigma or shame for being a human being.
47462	27	brzuwa	eohy5s5	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism. it's a spectrum for a reason. not everyone's super smart with a lovable tick like media loves to portray us, some of us feel like shit because we're expected to be prodigies by even our own families, but some of us can't even do simple tasks without going through a ton of mental stress and burning out.
47462	29	brzuwa	eohya5a	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	behavioural health tech of 3 years. ive had every type of person come through my facility. from your preschool teachers to executives of fortune 500 to clergymen to college students. no one is immune from stress and mental health. dont let the fact that youre getting straight as make you feel like your not the ones that need a counsellor. or that because people usually vent to you that you dont need to vent either. bad stress is bad stress. and sometimes, even for the ones that seem to have it all, can make a person crack. get help before you crack. because once you do, its much harder to come back from then having too much stress.
47462	148	brzuwa	eohv2n7	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	people need to stop treating moments of sadness as mental problem or depression.
47462	23	brzuwa	eohxjg7	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	nobody can continuously move upwards. if you go back a few steps, that doesn't mean you didn't go up those steps in the first place. you've done it before and you can do it again. stagnating or even regressing is perfectly normal, entirely human and expecting otherwise is irrational. the sooner you realize that the sooner you'll be able to put the breaks on how hard you're crashing and start working on going back up those steps and further.
47462	23	brzuwa	eohw1ei	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you would go to the doctor to treat a broken leg or diabetes or pneumonia. mental health treatment is just as valid.
47462	118	brzuwa	eohvnaz	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	im not lazy. telling me im lazy makes me feel even less motivated and hate myself even more, thus making me want to lay in bed all day wallowing in my own self hatred. i want to be good at things and excel, i just cant especially when im being told im lazy. i want to shrivel up and die most of the time, you shitting on me makes me want to hide in my cocoon thus making me stay in this rut. im proud of you for doing x has literally made me cry. even just taking care of myself and having someone say you look really good, im proud of you for coming out means *a lot*. positive reinforcement means everything when you have severe depression.
47462	21	brzuwa	eohywkf	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop handing out borderline personality disorder as an armchair diagnosis. the only way you can diagnose anyone is if you're a licensed professional seeing a client, face to face. other than that, no you can not diagnose anyone with anything, because you have no training and are not a professional. it gets under my skin the amount of times i've seen a bpd diagnosis get thrown around by people who have no idea what bpd actually is. the only thing that throwing around a diagnosis does, is further stigmatize people like myself who actually suffer from bpd. which sucks because it's already an extremely stigmatized disorder.
47462	20	brzuwa	eoi8yfn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop villainizing meds. i have bipolar disorder and its so hard to hear people bash medications and suggest meditation or natural remedies or other such bullshit. the medications keep me alive. without them i would have killed myself or gotten locked up decades ago.
47462	39	brzuwa	eohv7rl	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	with bipolar there are times that i need to be completely left alone to allow me to stay in my mindset, and their times where i need people to intercede and grab my hands or head to kick me out of whatever mindset that i have been locked into. unfortunately i may not show any outer signs which i'm in and both ways i have very little control. hopefully (like i have done) a bipolar person will train themselves to have a trigger which it allows you to ask the question of which problem they're having. for me if you hand me a coke or any liquid it pulls me out of my mind long enough that you can determine or you couldn't ask which part of the bipolar i mean positive or negative.
47462	39	brzuwa	eohvvfx	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	telling me to chill out, relax or not worry doesn't help. instead it creates more anxiety. some days little things set me off, some days when everything goes wrong i do not panic or cry till the end. i can not turn the worry off. anxiety has crippled me for years. if i say i don't want to go out or can't handle the store, please realize i cant and the smallest tasks to me seem like conquering mount everest. also stop recommending diets, yoga or meditation. if it was that easy i would, sometime medication is the only thing that helps.
47462	82	brzuwa	eohw7q8	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i am a guy with autism and add and i want to say: just because someone has autism or other behavioral issues, doesn't mean they get a get out of jail free card, it's understandable, no excusable. if susan's 5yo is running around pissing on everything, but has autism or some other mental illness, doesn't mean they can still run around shooting out liquids out of its fuckin bodily sausage
47462	94	brzuwa	eohwmco	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	self injury and scars: i spent 10 years of my life selfharming. more stitches then i can count. my arm is completely scarred and ruinied. how does that make me feel? honestly. it took me alot to get here, but i am not ashamed. i am proud that i can wear my stripes with my head high. cause for years i hid my arm under long sleeves and a black long gloves (i cut the glove-fingers off.) i got so many questions. remarks. and one day i just felt done. of hiding. i took the glove off, trying it out. and its the most liberating thing ive ever done. yes people look, but surprisingly not as much as you would think. it is pretty clear to everyone what i have done. people commented more when i tried to hide it. so i wear my scars proudly. ive been told by others who has selfharmed that they feel inspired to do the same. cause in all honesty people, as cliche as it sounds, they are your battlescars. the proof you despite all this pain, made it through . if people ask, be honest. if people stare, smile back. let them stare. its not dangerous. think of the road it took you to get here. and here you are. putting that chapter behind you. showing everyone that you fucking made it ! now how is that something to be ashamed of?

47462	16	brzuwa	eohxsmf	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"crying is okay. being scared is okay. nothing is ""easy"". some people may not be able to finish the ""easiest"" task. for some people getting up in the morning takes so much energy, that they don't have enough for anything else. stop comparing anything or anyone. yes, some people may gone through worse - but each and every being is different."
47462	15	brzuwa	eohybuq	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"i was in class yesterday,social psychology class giving a presentation on discourses. i made my presentation about how i suffer with bpd and what life is like with it,how it affects me and what people think of me. i made a slide with traits and characteristics of me as an individual versus the traits i display when my borderline personality disorder acts up. at the end of the presentation,she made me go back to the slide and asked who else in the room experiences intense anger,unstable interpersonal relationships,feelings of emptiness,etc. and that not one person can say they've never experienced at least one of the plethora of symptoms. many ""normal"" or ""regular"" people experience those symptoms,albeit not 5-9 all together but they experience some,and they are not labeled as freaks. so what makes people without mental illness be able to judge someone else with a mental illness when they experience similar symptoms."
47462	15	brzuwa	eoiasg9	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"just because your having trouble focusing today doesn't mean you have adhd. i'm tired of the ""lol. i'm so adhd! squirrel!"" shtick. if you truly had this disorder, you'd have trouble the majority of days and it would affect your life. forgot your keys? forgot to turn in a paper? forgot your lunch on the counter? it was probably a mistake. it happens to everyone once in awhile. shake it off and set reminders. consistently forget your keys, to turn in a paper, or forget your lunch consistently? did you keep trying strategies to help, but you still consistently screw up like this? sounds like a disorder. you probably have adhd and should talk to someone. without long term strategies and/or medication, you'll be like a car stuck in the mud that's spinning its tires as fast as it can but doesn't go anywhere."

47462	14	brzuwa	eohvjog	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	don't be afraid of us. show care and kindness to an ill person instead of trepidation and they will 100% appreciate it. take the time to make your own opinion of somebody before automatically accepting the harsh assumptions and stereotypes that are associated with a particular mental illness.
47462	14	brzuwa	eohxr3s	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop thinking we want attention. we dont. we fucking hate our illness. we dont want to live with it it would be even better to not have people know, but eventually someone has to know for our own well beeing.

47462	90	brzuwa	eohvulz	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	please don't say you have depression just because you feel sad once in a while. it's a real mental illness and not something teenagers should normalize to make themselves feel part of a smaller group of people. same goes for ocd. you don't have ocd if you want to arrange shit, ocd is far more serious than that.
47462	14	brzuwa	eohviv7	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	mental illness is a sickness, just like how there are other forms of sicknesses, mental health is a sickness of the brain. we can't control what are mental illnesses do or don't do. we just do the best we can and hope for the best. and i will say this again, we cannot control our mental illnesses. that would be like telling someone to control the flu they have or the chicken pox(not the best examples, but the best i got got at 2 in the morning). trust us, if we could control it, we would. and for others who suffer from mental illness, you shouldn't be ashamed about it. it takes a lot of courage and willpower to have to go through the constant stuggle and still maintain a life. as someone who has mental illness(anxiety, ocd, and depression), i just want to say, we can't control it, and it is imaginary or make belief or something we are faking. it's real, it's real illnesses, and we cant just make it go away. and for any people with mental illness that has read my comment, and people just in general, i'll say exactly what i got tattooed on my arm: your story isn't over yet; i hope this will help others gain some insight into mental illness. i have examples for some, but right now i am too tired to type them out so if someone wants to hear them, let me know. and to everyone suffering, i want to say, keep fighting. better days will come your way, i know it :)

47462	13	brzuwa	eohwmsi	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"it's no secret that some mental illnesses have been trivialised and even romanticised, but it's important to remember that there are what i call ""ugly"" sides of some mental illnesses. for example, and i'm a bit embarrassed to say this but, i have severe depression and it gives me a lack of motivation. this lack of motivation makes it very hard for me to be hygienic (i usually manage to pull through and be presentable when i need to be). i just wish i didn't have to feel embarrassed talking about this stuff. depression isn't just 'feeling sad'. it has a lot more baggage, and so do other mental illnesses."
47462	24	brzuwa	eohxahn	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you can have ptsd without ever having gone to war. my therapist is a combat veteran and im a sexual abuse survivor. we both have ptsd. were reading a book about trauma together. this book really destroyed the myth that civilians cant have ptsd and i wish i could just show it to every single person i meet. no matter *what* happened, the symptoms are almost the exact fucking same, just different triggers.
48199	6433	bobtwf	ene9a0t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	not being able to hold our breath long (quick oxygen usage)
48199	3612	bobtwf	enea2jc	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	tumors. organ ruptures caused by typical functions going wrong. many things about pregnancy. periods and ovarian cysts. also, for women, that the urethra is so short and so close to the vagina and anus.
48199	44578	bobtwf	eneet9v	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	pretty much any autoimmune disease. the body can literally kill itself trying to protect itself.

48199	30518	bobtwf	enefzz0	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	allergies, or said another way, your immune system flipping the fuck out because you bumped into a peanut, dust mite, shrimp, cat, etc.
48199	22168	bobtwf	ene7jil	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	there are many. but, notably to me is how easily damaged the knee joints and the spine are. they next to impossible completely repair. once damage they are never really right again.
48199	38147	bobtwf	enebd4t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how close the food pipe and wind pipe are.

48199	8198	bobtwf	ene8373	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	ears being so fragile and irreparable.
48199	5725	bobtwf	eneku22	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	my personal greatest flaw in the human body has to be the immune system. sure, i bet a lot of you have perfectly functional immune systems, but mine has decided my gastrointestinal tract is the enemy and must be eliminated at all costs. so basically whatever programming error led to my crohn's disease, that's the biggest flaw.
48199	9297	bobtwf	enemxf7	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	ectopic pregnancy ovaries are ovulatin and doing their things. eggs and what not. an egg decides enough is enough, and with the help of a hormone surge, wants out of that shit. bigger and better things. so the egg literally punches out, and is supposed to go straight into the fallopian tubes, get fertilized while inside the tubes, and then plant in the uterus. you would think that the entrance of the fallopian tubes would connect right to the ovary? nah the opening of the fallopian tube has these little hairs (fimbriae) that are like wacky inflatable tube men in front of sketchy used car lots, and kind of guide the egg into the fallopian tube. sometimes, the eggs dont feel like it going, and they venture off. and if fertilized, its considered an ectopic pregnancy. it can plant anywhere in the abdominal cavity at that point. most of the time, it will die because it has to plant in a well vascularized region to be viable. sometimes, it finds a good, bloody spot, and starts growing there. at that point its essentially a tumor, and of it can eat enough into a blood vessel, in can rupture and bleed like shit. you would think that millions of years of evolution would create a fallopian tube that opens up right to the ovary, but thats not the case

48199	14226	bobtwf	enebwgd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	your brain replaying embarrassing moments over and over until you die
48199	23839	bobtwf	enecfnw	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	breathing hole = food hole. squids have it worse, food passes through their brains. but then again i have never heard of a squid choking to death on a bite of bruschetta. &#x200b; edit: goodness me, thank you to all the people who informed me that we can breathe through our noses and that our breathing hole is the way it is because of our evolution so we can speak. you have all really opened my eyes. just remember the next time you are at a fancy restaurant and you find yourself choking on a bite of bruschetta just calmly breathe through your nose and talk to the nearest waiter, i'm sure they will help you out.
48199	21757	bobtwf	enehuzt	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	if i wipe the wrong direction i could get an infection that could spread to my kidneys and kill me

48199	5230	bobtwf	ene8p04	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain should be better secured in the head. rattling the brain inside the skull can mess a person up, so if it was more secure it would be safer.

48199	13424	bobtwf	ene6y6h	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	cancer. routine processes meant to repair the body create mistakes that in turn create tumors.

48199	8977	bobtwf	ene76vb	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	getting tired and needing to sleep. i could have done so much shit if i hadn't had to sleep. though really, i probably would have just still not done anything.
48199	9386	bobtwf	eneiodn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that we can bite the insides of our own cheeks. i'm sure plently of you know the pain of accidentally biting down on your cheek. edit: thanks whoever gave the award fam!

48199	2151	bobtwf	enebkdm	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the amount of time it takes for us to grow and mature to a level where we are able to contribute and not be 100% dependent on our parents/family unit. or the fact we have a useless organ that randomly ruptures and will kill you if you don't seek treatment for it.
48199	620	bobtwf	enejrhn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain. if you don't treat it right; it can fuck you up. having you believing you need something when you know it;s bad for you. make you think horrible things and sometimes do horrible things. if you don't feed it positive information; you can grow up believing in evil, or ignorant things. and it controls everything.
48199	2731	bobtwf	ened91u	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. most other animals who have a menstruation cycle, or something like it, reabsorb the uterine lining rather than shedding it out and causing woman to suffer from painful bleeding out of their vaginas for 5-6 days once a month. edit: i think that if we have to shed it, it should be a voluntary sphincter (like controlling when you pee). so woman dont have to spend so much money on pads & tampons, dont have to worry about bleeding through, can stress free wear a bikini, etc.
48199	27671	bobtwf	eneccni	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the absolute randomness in its strengths vs vulnerabilities. a person can jump from a plane, have their parachute not open & survive the impact. or you can slip in the shower, break your fucking neck, and die on the spot.
48199	20544	bobtwf	enefjy3	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	my schlong is more like a schlort
48199	1265	bobtwf	eneqh8m	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the pain and complications associated with giving birth. giraffes can birth a whole tiny giraffe hooves and all and go about their day, yet women are still enduring massive amounts of pain (and/or death) during childbirth. it seems evolutionarily unproductive.
48199	958	bobtwf	enegij5	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	wisdom teeth. they were useful when we used to have bigger jaws, but now they often cause pain and infection
48199	5535	bobtwf	ened71t	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	we're physiologically built to have sex with as many people as possible as soon as we hit puberty, but practically, socially, and psychologically, that's a *really* bad idea.
48199	642	bobtwf	enf887o	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	physician here. 1) testes only work when they are located outside the body at the junction of two limbs that converge, funneling many stray objects towards them. 2) the low back. omg. dont get me started. 3) clotting is so complex its no wonder it messes up so often. 4) sinuses. like.why? and why do the holes leading into them need to be so small? 5) the immune system is really bad at stopping things it needs to stop and its really good at damaging the body. 6) we evolved on this planet, so why is the light of the sun too bright for us to tolerate? 7) our bodies like to store fat.in our arteries? 8) sometimes, the babys head wont fit through the pelvis. 8a) even by mammal standards, our newborns are remarkably ill-equipped. a newborn dog can crawl. a newborn horse can walk. we take a year to walk and almost two decades until we can fend for ourselves. ill think of more.
48199	1143	bobtwf	ene6xpz	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the genitals arent protected by any bones and are utterly fragile.
48199	15082	bobtwf	ene95hn	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	teeth cannot repair themselves (i think?). if a bone can heal back together why the hell can't a tooth fill in a micro hole. in a natural state, teeth are pretty dam important. edit: just want to say thanks to all for the upvotes. it does not go unappreciated. may we all have perfect teeth forever.
48199	14896	bobtwf	enek3iy	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the fact that theres so many things you can do to the human body without killing it but _oh fuck slept wrong and pinched a nerve now im fucking paralyzed_ (didnt happen to me, but happened to a semi distant family member a year ago) edit: holy fuck this comment took off edit 2: to everybody getting paranoid in my replies, dont worry: he was sleeping in a crowded camper on a small couch in a very, very awkward position this isnt a very common thing, but it does happen to people. so long as you sleep relatively well you shouldnt have a problem. edit 3: apparently reddits full of health experts who know for a fact that you cant do this. he pinched and severed something in his spinal cord from what i remember, im not 100% sure if it was a nerve but idk what else it would be tbh. _either way the point i was trying to convey was this man went from sleeping to paralyzed, so._

48199	428	bobtwf	ene7785	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	cranial and neck structure. one wrong bump of the head and you can suffer serious injury or death.
48199	1078	bobtwf	enejywk	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	our lumbar and ass aren't really that great at holding us up and this is why everyone has back problems regardless of whether they spend their lives working out, sitting in a chair, or in between. evolutionarily, we should have spent more time in trees waiting for our muscles and such to develop more to support the greater half of our bodies being held upright without destroying the system that's meant to do exactly that.
48199	2950	bobtwf	enee4js	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	over-storing fat. i mean, i get hanging onto 20 pounds of the stuff just in case you need to tap into that energy - but at 50, 100, 300 pounds our bodies are still like well better still stock up, you never know if well find any food this upcoming year.
48199	1044	bobtwf	enehy1j	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. not even fucking rats have them
48199	4009	bobtwf	ene70aj	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	that an amusement park doubles as a waste management center.
48199	265	bobtwf	enf3o43	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the female reproductive system. the urethra is too close to the anus/vaginal opening. this can cause lots of utis if we aren't careful. our hips are nearly too narrow to birth our babies. we can literally split our vagina into our anus while giving birth. also the monthly bleeding thing, i'm fucking over it and i've still got a good 20-30 years of it left. it's a damned inconvenience on it's best days and a nightmare of literal blood and pain on its worst days.
48199	685	bobtwf	enecoyh	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	getting a boner/sexually excited for no reason, and often at the wrong time.

48199	1057	bobtwf	eneb6d7	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	water tube and breathing tube are same tube :(((((
48199	214	bobtwf	enf25xu	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	birth and pregnancy are way too tasking on a woman. like, other animals can hunt, run, play, etc. literally hours before having to give birth, can get up right afterwards, don't have to take care of their kids for years, and their babies, y'know, actually fit when they're being birthed. we literally can't even give birth right. women used to die all the damn time before we made medical advances because our bodies are not fit to birth our own children, which *biologically*, is the entire fucking point of life.
48199	70	bobtwf	enego9f	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	too many teeth in too little space. gets easily fucked up, and you keep randomly biting your tongue/lips/cheeks somehow
48199	968	bobtwf	ene9xmd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain hardware has some compatibility issues with the software. i.e. patch random boners, agression instinct, need for attention, staring at boobs and affection for shiny stuff then we can talk.
48199	137	bobtwf	eneezvd	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the long start-up time from birth to functioning at the bare minimum.being housebroken, able to communicate, walk etc.
48199	454	bobtwf	enehseh	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. as someone who never wants kids im always reminded of how pointless the whole process is for me.
48199	64	bobtwf	enf06ap	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	compensation: an extreme example. problem in one part of spine, muscles on the other side start to compesate. pelvis becoms misaligned because back is not functioning symmetrically. now, spinal problem has made the entire back spasm to support, walking hurts, probably more prone to headaches now, etc.
48199	193	bobtwf	enetozt	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	eyelashes and how they always find a way into my fucking eyes
48199	97	bobtwf	enf06qx	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	scrotum. why put the survival of the species in the hands of a thin walled defenseless sack of skin?

48199	100	bobtwf	enez8h6	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	as someone who has been pregnant to term three times. the whole pregnancy experience is completely flawed. whoever designed the female body for carrying and birthing children should be fired.
48199	211	bobtwf	eneiqxp	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	limited amount of telomeres &#x200b; edit: i didn't know that excessive telomeres or abnormally durable telomeres increase the likelihood of cancer. i should have just said mortality, nature can sort that shit out. i was under the impression that longer or more durable telomeres = longer lifespan, til.
48199	51	bobtwf	enen7co	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	babies, in general. most all other babies are born and are fairly self sufficient or minimally dependent (with exceptions for certain animals i admit), but human babies are just crying poop machines for like ~3 years.
48199	238	bobtwf	enefg19	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	aging. &#x200b; last i checked, living is 100% fatal so let's fix that.
48199	89	bobtwf	eneyw6g	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	humans are the only mammals where the birth canal is too small to properly give birth to offspring. child birth isn't supposed to be painful, difficult, or time consuming. however, due to humanity's evolution to bipedal-ism, the pelvis shrunk and reshaped itself for a standing position. this change allowed humanity to become more mobile and flexiable, but at a serious cost.
48199	117	bobtwf	enejw8w	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	where neovascularization (new blood vessel growth) of the eye takes place. youre diabetic and your retina isnt getting enough oxygen? lets make new blood vessels on top of the retina and cause things like retinal detachments. youve got macular degeneration and need more oxygen too? lets grow some under your retina and make you need shots in your eye. the front of the eye also can develop new blood vessels but this commonly takes place in the angle (the drainage area for aqueous). this leads to extremely high eye pressure and glaucoma.

48199	129	bobtwf	enegf72	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. ~~here i am, trying to make her mayor of wangtown, and i pull out with rudolph the red nose dickdeer on my pelvis.~~ i find it odd that we evolved so that a fair chunk of half the species is in debilitating pain 1/4 of the month.
48199	108	bobtwf	enegytu	what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how we cant control every aspect of our brain, cause if we would we could just be like hey yo body, start growing muscle and your body would just be like alright ill get on that.

61851	4474	bri3ja	eoe6cio	anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	im an anesthesiologist assistant. propofol is the standard drug of choice to knock patients out for surgery. there is a short window of time after the propofol hits where people are still lucid enough to talk, maybe 20 seconds tops. as i started to push a full syringe of propofol into his iv, one of my patients asked me if i wanted to hear him sing his alma maters war hymnhis way of giving me a hard time because i went to a rival college. i couldnt refuse. it sounded like this: good luck to dear old aggies/ they are the boyyyyys thatttttt-narrrr.hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.nnn. .at which point his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he stopped breathing. got to commend his fighting spirit, though. edit: yes, a big dose of propofol makes you stop breathing. if nothing is done about it, you probably never breathe again (think michael jackson). anesthesia providers are trained to breathe for you; either temporarily via a mask, or via a breathing tube and ventilator. in this case i intubated him and put him on the vent. all standard procedure and he did great. edit 2: changed it to war hymn even though i swear he called it the battle hymn.also, hook em!

52334	783	bq2sd5	eo0z34t	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i once was a tour guide in high school for a group of young chinese students coming to the rural us on a sort of fresh air trip. they told us beforehand that we had to keep the kids away from water because apparently parents dont value swimming lessons in china and there is such little open swimmable water that no one learns on their own. we were also told that the kids think swimming happens naturally  like if you go into water, youll immediately start swimming. anyways, one of our excursions was to a local reservoir and the plan was to hike up a hill nearby to overlook the reservoir lake, get a few photos, and then leave. when we got to the top, it started pouring rain like i had never seen before. im talking so much rain you cant see 5 feet in front of you. then lightning starts striking the lake and im still trying to keep it cool even though i had never been so close to lightning before. the students were taking it well and laughing, which was good, until they started running _directly for the lake_ and *jump in*. apparently they had also never learned about electricity conducting through water, so im freaking out and start pulling them out of the water (they werent in very far) and a couple of them complain that their phones were wet. in the rain. no one got hurt, but it was a crazy day. we got back on the bus and the kids started drinking liquor in the back (they ranged ages 9-16) and i had to bust them for that too. tl;dr: apparently chinese kids think swimming will just happen if you go in water, especially lightning-struck water

52334	13930	bq2sd5	eo0t7ct	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	we're pretty good at stopping tourist from doing too much damage. after being in the industry for a while you get a spidey sense for when people are going to do dumb things and can often steer them away from doing anything too bad. that being said, here's one of my favourite stories to tell. i was 7 months pregnant and it was the week before i went on maternity leave. i was driving out to one of our sites and to get there i had to drive (on the road of course) through our penguin colony. this particular species of penguin burrows underground and stays hidden in their burrow during the day, and comes out at night when birds of prey and other potential predators have gone to sleep. as i'm driving out to the site i realise the parking lot up ahead is full and people have started parking up and down the road. and that's when i see a giant suv pull off the road, drive between the bollards and into the penguin colony. i pull over as what seems like 20 non-english speaking tourists start to pile out of the vehicle and take selfies with the ocean backdrop. staying as calm as possible and using sign language i point out the no entry signs of the bollards they drove past, the burrows they have just collapsed, inform them they may have killed penguins, and to get their fucking vehicle out of the fucking colony. once i got them out of there i started digging out the collapsed burrows to check for penguins. the first four were luckily empty but the last one had a breeding pair. i get the girl out, check her over for injuries, and having no where else to put her i follow protocol and tuck her under my left arm against my side. i get the boy out and put him in the same position on the right side and start to check him over. remember how i said i was pregnant? well normally, you hold a penguin down low almost on your hip, but because of my round tummy i was holding him more at the bottom of my ribcage. so when i turned my head to start my health check, the bastard reached up and grabbed my top lip with his beak and ripped straight through the middle. it was about this time that the tourists walking along the road realised this ranger was holding onto two penguins. i had five or six tourists sprint through the colony towards me and start snapping pictures. while at the same time potentially collapsing more burrows. if any internet sleuths stumble across a picture of a heavily pregnant, pissed off looking ranger, holding two penguins with blood pouring down her face let me know. i've been waiting for that picture to show up for 3 years and haven't found it yet. happy ending, i chased away the photographers, popped the two uninjured penguins in a nearby unoccupied burrow, and radioed for back up to help with the parking situation. my lip healed without a scar, and both penguins left the following morning for a well deserved day in the ocean. tl;dr signage is there for a reason. rules are there for a reason. if you don't know what the reason is, doesn't mean you should break the rules. edits: real tl;dr tourists drove over penguin burrows. no penguins were harmed in the making of this story. just. glad people seem to appreciate the work we do with these super cute (vicious, and smelly) animals. they're worth every ounce of blood, sweat and tears!

""i think my wife was killed by a lion."" gasp, shock. everyone is freaked out, asking him what happened, and as he's trying to explain, the now-irate wife walks up to the campsite and starts yelling. so what had happened? well, they'd walked off, and at some point near the toilets, they both heard a kind of snuffling noise in the underbrush, clearly an animal rooting around. the husband completely freaks out, pushes his wife towards the noise and *down to the ground*, screams, and runs away. spoiler alert, it was not a lion and the wife was not pleased at the attempts at being sacrificed. the guide told us that they didn't speak the entire rest of the trip and they he believes they got divorced. hilarious. tl;dr; don't shove your wife into the ground if you think there is a hungry lion in the underbrush just to save yourself. edit: because mobile."

52334	622	bq2sd5	eo0um59	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was a tour guide at a historic village museum (similar to colonial williamsburg). the worst thing was the blatant sexual harassment by some older male visitors towards our female guides (some who obviously look under 16) who wear the old fashioned dresses. you'd be surprised how many men on group tours openly ask our staff members to show them what's under their dress, talk about how it used to be acceptable to marry girls under 16 and how they wish it was still acceptable, or make pretty gross sexual remarks about our staff members in front of the group and i. when you would call them out on their behavior as being inappropriate they would act like you were wrong for getting offended by it and that we should accept it since we were demonstrating life in the 18th century. i heard and saw some pretty bad stuff which would make both the other guests and staff uncomfortable. it also wasn't uncommon for people to sneak away from the tour group to go into restricted areas in an attempt to hunt the ghosts which are supposedly on the property. theres a reason those places are out of bounds, there can be irreplaceable artifacts we don't want accidentally damaged, tools, or the area hasn't been cleared by the fire marshal to allow guest access. small things have been broken by people doing this. people love to get confrontational about being told they can't go into restricted areas or touch the artifacts despite all the signs hung up.

52334	9239	bq2sd5	eo0v3ga	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	during my summers in college, i worked as a raft guide on a whitewater river in the southeast. it wasnt a difficult job; the two biggest things we were responsible for were running our trips in a timely manner and ensuring that the guests in our boat had a fun and safe trip down the river. the safety part is important, because people visiting the river frequently forget that it is a natural wilderness feature and carries all of the associated dangers. we frequently received questions about whether the rafts were on tracks, whether i actually had to do anything in the back, and (my personal favorite) whether the river went in a circle and we would end up back where we started. this last question was particularly funny because we took a bus from the rafting outpost to the put-in of the river  why bother if we were going in a circle?! one summer afternoon, i had a boat with three groups of two people; one of those groups was a mother and son. the mother seemed nice, if timid, as did the son. however, as i was going through the routine of explaining the safety concerns and paddle commands, it started to dawn on me that he was not very bright. there was nothing wrong with him  he was just dumb as shit. once we were on the river, he almost immediately developed a habit of checking the depth of the water with his paddle. he would incessantly plunge the blade into the water without care nor concern for his surroundings and circumstances. the water on this river is pristine. almost crystal clear. the riverbed is visible almost constantly, and still, this young man felt the need to verify the veracity of his own eyeballs by shoving his paddle into the river like some sort of deranged perpetual motion machine. of course, i warned him against his actions. at first, my concerns were that his depth-checking interferes with his ability to follow my commands and paddle. eventually, however, my pleading grew more desperate as it dawned on me that this child paid no deference to my authority. he answered only to chaos. it finally came to a head when, in a portion of the river that was extremely shallow (probably no more than a foot deep), he plunged his paddle into the riverbed with a force that shook the surrounding countryside. like excalibur, the paddle wedged itself among the rocks, perfectly erect. the boy, with a staid iron grip that could only be wielded by someone incredibly dense, kept his hand on the paddle as the rushing water carried us away from its new location. in one swift motion, he was wrenched from the raft and landed in a foot of water. he wore a face of bewildered idiocy. it was quite satisfying to keep his paddle in the back with me for the remainder of the trip after i returned him safely to the raft. all he could do was stare wistfully at the riverbed, his poo brain longing to verify its depth.

"i'm a guide for a popular mainstream brewery. the way tours work there, we always have two guides per tour: one leading and one closing the group, for safety reasons. when we greet people, part of our spiel consists in pointing out the fact that the only toilets are located at the entrance - so right where we are standing at the moment - and the pub at the end of tour. we also make it very clear that no one should at any point be behind the closing guide, no matter what. both of these will be important later on. so, on the day this happened, the other guide and i were alternating between leading and closing. we greeted our group of ~25 people and noticed there was a little boy of around 4 there with his parents. this wasn't the first time something of the sort happened, but i'll never understand why people feel the need to bring their children and even babies to a brewery. much less one that is advertised as being difficult to walk around. oh well. we leave with our group and everything is fine until we reach the brew room. at this point, while my colleague is explaining the beer making process, the father approaches me saying that his son needs the toilet. i tell him that we are close to the pub and ask if he can wait five minutes so we could all leave the brew room together, or if he'd rather the three of us leave for the pub immediately and rejoin the group later on. he answers ""nevermind"" and rejoins the group. after a minute or so, i hear the door to the room opening and closing, this is a big no-no of course, because we need to always be aware of where everyone is. so, i go to investigate and find the father holding his son while he pees around the corner. fml"

"i used to give ""naturalist boat trips"" through a coastal area in florida. very slow, see dolphins, learn history, see lots of birds and learn about them, horseshoe crabs, island ecology, etc. i would usually start as we left the dock by talking about some of the small commercial fishing boats there and how they worked. then, on to the history of the area. by this time people would typically be asking questions. one nice young couple said. nothing. other than saying hello when they got on the boat -- and they were the only ones on the boat -- they said.nothing. i had no idea what to do. did they hate it? did they love it? should i keep talking? should i shut up? i was sweating bullets. so i more or less talked for the first hour (not constantly, but some.) and for the second hour, i didn't say a word. i figured if they wanted to say something or ask a question, they would. the only sound for that last hour was the low hum of the boat engine and the occasional loud bird. at the dock, they thanked me and gave me a tip and walked away. to this day, i still can't figure out what was going on, but it was my most memorable time as a guide."

52334	124	bq2sd5	eo0y67m	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was an educator in a museum and we had a summer camp for middle school kids. one day we got to take them on a tour of the roof where we had a garden and a cool view. it was 9 stories up. some of the boys were tossing gravel over the sides so i had to hover near them to get them to behave. then as we were waiting for the single elevator to head down, this big boy (he was probably no more than 11 but was the size of a 16 year old) decides he doesnt wanna wait for the elevator anymore. he grabs the outer doors and pries them open. fortunately, elevator doors are two layers for this very reason. we were not looking down the elevator shaft, but at another set of doors. but that caused the elevator to be unable to open on our level. so then i had to take a group of 20 rowdy 11 year olds down 9 flights of stairs. overall at that job i gave museum tours to hundreds of groups of kids and their parents and without a doubt i can say the parents were more trouble than the kids.

(there was another guide in the front) when we got out to the forest the kids father demanded that we stopped. he wanted me to take a picture of all of them after they got to the top of this super steep mountain. he starts kicking and smacking his horse and he is yelling at all of his family members to do the same before the kid even finishes translating what his father said. i asked the kid to tell them to stop. tell them no. the kid is trying but they are all turning up this hill and not listening. now these horses were well trained and mannered but they also will listen even though they have been trained to stay in line. so the father gets his horse going up this hill and smacks his horses butt one more time and his horse takes off up this mountain. idk if anyone has watched how a horse runns up a mountain but the almost hop. its not easy to stay on. the worst part is, about 7 of the 12 horses follow suite and start running up this mountain. the other guide and i look at one another in panic mode as all these peoples screams are fading up this hill. thankfully the other guide and i can think quick. she grabs the few remaining horses that didnt run as all of their riders are also screaming and crying and yelling. i decide i need the translator boy to stay with me so i tell him what i am going to do, how to hold on and i ask him if he thinks he can do it so we can go stop all these horses. he nods leans forward and holds on as i get both are horses running up the hill. when i reach the top 4 of the older horses had slowed down and were eating so i tell the boy to tell them to get off the horses. he replies they dont know how and are too scared i (try not to show my irritation) jump off my horse as i tell him to give them my instructions step for step. he does but they all shake their heads as they are death gripping the horn. thank god asians are usually light and small. i basicaly had to lift/drag them off of the horses. i told them all to start walking down the hill and go with the others. i tied up their horses to the nearest tree asked the boy to hold on tight again and took off looking for the others. i finally found a younger man and his wife(?) she was covered in pine needles with a few scratches on her arms and covered in dirt. the boy (i assume) asks what happened then tells me her horse went under a tree and she didnt fit. the mans horse was behind hers so it stopped barely missing her and he got off to help her. i again told them to start walking and i tie up his horse. so now i have 2 missing horses and 1 missing tourist. it took me and that boy 40 min to finally catch up and find his father. this poor boy was so embarrassed and worried and when we finally catch up to him and his horse and the riderless horse trailing behind he looks up and says ""ya, real cowboys now! huh son."" i grabbed this dudes reigns and told his son to tell him to get off of his horse now! i told him to follow us and have him walk behind my horse, his sons horse and the now 2 riderless horses tied in a pack line. the father was angry and kept talking to his son but his son was so mad at him he would not reply or even look back at him. the poor kids face was so red. the other guide had managed to get all the other riders and horses back to the stable by the time we got back and when i pulled that kid off of his horse i looked him in the eyes and i told him how thankful i was for him and how brave he was. i told him to stay strong and to hold his chin high because he did the right thing. i told him he was a hero and an excellent rider because that was a lot for a 9 year old kid to handle for his first time on a horse. that day was an unforgetable nightmare. but that kid was a champion."
52334	475	bq2sd5	eo0u37e	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	kind of the reverse of this, i was on a tour and the tour guide did something bad. i was on a bus tour of washington dc. my family and i had gotten these hop-on tickets, where the buses circulated through dc and we can get on any bus within 24 hours. anyone who has ever been to dc knows that traffic after 4pm is absolute chaos. everything in closing at the same time because its all government and everyone is trying to get out. this double decker bus goes to turn a corner and there is a car illegally parked at the end of the street. it was parked sorta parallel to the curb, but had its back half technically in the crosswalk. well, the bus driver hits the car. not only does he hit the car (which is illegally parked in a city in chaos) but the drivers side is basically shaved off because of how close we hit the car. the guide yells god damn it and tells the passengers that weve hit something and need to exchange insurance info. as jovial as the guy had been telling us about the foundation of the district and where lincoln had been assassinated, he was irate for the hour and a half we were stuck.

52334	164	bq2sd5	eo0xc3q	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but this happened while we were being given a tour of a milk packaging factory that we intended to shoot for a commercial. control was super tight, we needed special permission, sterilized suits, goggles and hair nets just to get inside. the director goes over to one side of the factory to check the lighting, see if it's a good angle to shoot. he photographs the whole place to keep as reference and then it happens. he drops his phone. into an open vat of milk. the factory had to shut down immediately. over 150.000 liters of milk had to be scrapped, the vats had to be washed and sterilized, the health inspector had to be called down so production could restart. it was an unmitigated mess and i have no idea how we were still allowed to shoot inside the factory after that. although each crew member had to get a one-hour training session before going in.
52334	352	bq2sd5	eo0x9ks	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in amsterdam as a pub crawl guide for 6 months a couple years ago. a normal night we could have between 50 and 80 people, however during the summer those numbers double. so one night we're still at the start point before the crawl starts and a big group of lads come to join. they were on a stag and clearly out for a mad one. the crawl would start with an hour of cheap beers and free shots from the guides, these lads tore through our supplies. as we start, they're all already pretty smashed but aside from being loud, they're fine. as the crawl progresses however, some of them started disappearing and reappearing. we would always warn the pub crawlers to not buy drugs from street dealers but we were busy with guiding and aren't babysitting anyone (unless they need it and i'd get them water and a safe way to where ever they needed to go). it's about the 4th pub (out of 6) and it's clear the lads on the stag are buzzing. half are smiling so brightly that you'd swear there was a literal supernova of lightbulbs going off in their heads, the other half are drooling through the smiles and gurning. it's at this point that shit took off. suddenly one of the lads had a massive stuffed eagle. he didn't have it at the beginning but now we had about 30 lads off their tits bowing and praising a massive stuffed eagle that one is holding over his head. one of the other lads shouts that they need to make an offering, and then throws his pint at it. this generates a huge laugh and then the lads all shower the eagle with booze. everyone is in hysterics at this point. then the first glass was smashed. i think it was an accident, but the next 30 glasses smashing wasn't. the lads went fucking insane, they started throwing chairs around the place and smashing glasses. a few fights break out as there's a bunch of other people in this pub who aren't taking their shit. amid the chaos, the guy with the eagle is still standing in the middle holding it up and beseeching everyone to be calm like the eagle. so at this point, the other guides and i looked at each other and shrugged and started moving the rest of the pub crawlers along, keeping all these people here wasn't going to help the situation. so we continued, until a few of the lads caught up down the street a bit. they tried to start a fight with a random passerby, but two of them got cleanly knocked out by the guy before the others backed down. more shit i have to deal with, so i tell my buddy to keep the crawl going and i called the ambulance. once the two lads were taken care of i took off and finished the crawl. the shittiest thing is what happened afterwards. one of the two lads, once arriving at the hospital, immediately took off and walked away, refusing help. the police picked him up and seeing he was fucked up, took him back to the hospital. he ran again, and again they picked him up and brought him in. they warned him that if he ran off again then he'd be sleeping it off in a cell, but of course he ran again. some point during the night this fella died in the cell of an overdose. he had taken some shite from a street dealer and was one of many who had died from some white powder heroin that was being sold as cocaine. tl;dr: died.
52334	78	bq2sd5	eo14ev3	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	former horse trail guide. group of 6 on the trail, plus me at the rear for safety and our leader up ahead. the ride was a faster ride, meant to be for people who already had some experience riding and wanted excitement. old witch (ow) and her grandson of about 12 (gs) were 2 of the riders. ow disregards all safety rules from minute 1. we ask them to ride in single file and not overtake each other as horses tend to fight when they think theyre being overtaken. ow wanted to go both in front and behind of her gs and wouldnt take no for an answer. for the first 20 minutes she repeatedly kicked her horse forward and then took a photo, and then took him back behind gs. both horses were getting upset and gs was getting frightened because he did not have any riding skills at all and his horse was getting alarmed. this conversation happened: me: maam please keep your horse in its place in the line. your grandsons horse is getting upset and he isnt enjoying the ride because of that. ow: how long have you been riding? how old are you? me: im 18 and ive been riding for 12 years ma-am. ow: well ive been riding 40 years. thats a bit longer, dont you think? me: im sorry but these are our horses and im responsible for your grandsons safety. it isnt safe to keep overtaking him. she stopped the shenanigans for a bit. then we got to the fast part of the ride. theres a fire break - a long sand track by a fence - that we always used for a fast run. the horses knew it and rarely needed more than a little kick to go fast there. ow was behind gs at this point after finally stopping with her photographs. we stop before the fast part for a safety instruction which consists of you dont have to make the horse go fast, it will follow the leader, but feel free to give it a kick if it doesnt, and remember to lean back not forward, and try not to overtake. i swear to god ow looked back at me and smirked as my coworker said those words. ow was on a lovely, responsive horse. we would use this horse when 5 or 6 year old children were on beginner rides and he never ever played up. as soon as they got onto the fast strip, she literally booted him so loud that i could hear it like a drum. the horse was afraid and fucking took off at top speed - barrelling through the other riders, including ows grandson. two other riders had their horses swerve into tree branches and were knocked off. she put literally every person in the ride in danger. her grandson fell off. i helped him back up and he was crying and too afraid to even start going again, so i had to put him behind me, and ow in front of me so that ow could not possibly fuck up his horse any more. she then proceeded to ask my name and tell me she would get me fired. this made my day because i worked for my mum and also i had been fired literally 2 days earlier in an argument with my mum and i was back because she needed me. ow seemed pissed that i didnt care one bit. she never did complain about me though and her grandson was so sweet and really appreciated being behind me and not subject to her horse upsetting his. i felt so bad for the kid.

52334	72	bq2sd5	eo14acj	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i spent a year in the korean dmz as a tour guide with a gun. my job was to bring vips safely up to the border for a visit and, ideally, safely back. usually these people were diplomats, generals, or heads of state.so generally well behaved. celebrities were trouble though, very entitled. the us womens soccer team was like herding cats and several of them were drunk, which is against the rules but i was told to ignore it. cant believe that wasnt an international incident. but the worst visitor i had was the lead singer of puddle of mud. the rest of the guys in the band were super nice and respectful but the singer was high on something and literally crossed the border into north korea with dprk guards about 10ft away. i was able to step onto the cement curb that marks the border, grab his belt, and yank him back into south korea.

52334	132	bq2sd5	eo0x2rd	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in museums for ten years and saw plenty of horrors, usually kids being left to jump all over everything. i've tried to block much of it out but here are a few i remember;  a man loudly talking to his grandson about the exhibits in a very pompous tone who turned to me at a case of delicate 16c pieces, asking how he could open the case. wtf? oh yeah! take my keys and get your big maulers over everything why don't you! a broken china cup shoved into a drawer in the childrens edwardian style play kitchen. i was tidying up and the jagged pieces almost tore my inner arm open. a lady looking on as her grandson clambered all over a very expensive sculpture in the gallery which was part of a contemporary exhibition. i stood alongside her for a few moments, smiling sweetly and said 'lovely piece isn't it? a real investment at 30k' she soon got the little crotchgoblin out of it then. people complaining about the lighting in the gallery. each set of lights had to be set to particular levels depending on the piece it was shining on. 'i'm an artist myself and it takes hours to get the colours just right. what's the point if you can't see it properly?' well if you're an artist, flower, you'll know all about light damage won't you? on one occasion we had an amazing pre-raphaelite painting on loan. no guards, no barrier-you could get up close and personal to it-it was amazing! yep, you've guessed it. we had someone whinge the lighting then. i explained the reasoning and that the light levels were a condition of the loan and the insurance, but no. her needs are far more important than the conservation of a silly old painting. people trying to donate actual rubbish to the collections-connect four with half the pieces missing, that kind of thing-and getting very arsey when we politely thanked them for their trouble and advised that 'we actually already have one of those'. a teacher with absolutely no control over her class who were running around *screaming* and smacking into cases. in fact, i saw a couple of bullies with a little boy shoved up against one of the cases. this was a really small museum too, so it's not like she can't have noticed. when i spoke with her about it she did the 'children! behave or the lady is going to make us all leave!' no wonder she had no control if she never took any responsibility. finding a drug addict in a jacobean four poster bed because 'they were tired'. there are loads more, but these are the ones i can remember. i guess they seem pretty minor, but when you get the same scenario over and over, there's definitely cumulative frustration which lead to lower tolerance of the public!

""kind, funny, and generous"" are only three of the dozen words i could use to describe him. however. i'd sourced him some cocaine during my guide of the best bars and sights of the city we were in. well, i'd *subtly* said ""that guy in the hat is known as a cocaine dealer. other people have told me his blow is the best."". the trouble began when the cops came to close down some of the bars on this party-street. we were outside having a cigarette. i mean, the trouble didn't start then. the trouble really began when he threw a beer bottle at the wall, then started peeing on a police ute. please note, this is while there were approximately thirty armed police on the block. some had shotguns. some, rifles. all of them had at least pistols. a few even had batons. somehow, i managed to distract, apologize, and generally diffuse the situation. he started panicking, not least because he had about $500 usd in drugs in his pickets, but also swearing about ""these fucking pigs, i could buy them all off, they don't know me, i have more shit in my pocket than they earn in a month"". but thankfully the police within earshot did not speak english. i translated completely the opposite of what he said to me. i managed to persuade the nearest cops that this 'gentleman' was, while very drunk, sincerely apologetic for his urination. i told them i was taking him home. i would look after him. with my arm over his shoulders and still spewing apologies to the police in spanish, i said to him ""bro, shut up and walk, act drunk, do not yell, say nothing but your highschool-spanish words for apology, and walk with me and do not mention the things in your pocket again."". we made it to the corner. as we turned, some other police who obviously understood english got closer and started yelling at us to stop. i didn't stop. i pushed idiot-dj around the corner, then said"" run!"". we ran a few blocks. he tipped me $250usd, over two weeks wages for me at the time."
52334	111	bq2sd5	eo0vcb2	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	in maryland, i constantly see tourists keeping undersized blue crabs. they are usually foreign, and usually asian. i'm not trying to stereotype, it's just the facts after being out there for 10+ years. keeping undersized crabs, especially females is detrimental to the crab populations. we try to explain it, but they mostly ignore us. can't ignore the rangers though.

52334	154	bq2sd5	eo0z3dt	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was on a tour in the chernobyl exclusion zone and there was a group of students showing they had zero idea what nuclear radiation is. asking questions like why there isn't any farming in the zone, and then arguing with the tour guide. one guy was literally touching everything and then dipping his hands in a bag with crisps. when he got a nosebleed halfway through i told him it was the radiation sickness kicking in. of course when we were checked before leaving the zone he had to be decontaminated. what an idiot.

"i'm a helicopter pilot and i used to fly tourists to the bottom of the grand canyon for a picnic. the world trade center attacks had happened a few years prior to this event. as we were flying over the canyon, a gentleman (who was nursing a hangover) asked if we could fly over a certain landmark. after telling him i could lose my job if i did so, he asked ""what if i put a gun to your head?"". you could feel the tension from the other passengers in the aircraft. i told him he shouldn't say things like that to me. i could tell he was just trying to be funny and he knew he fucked up. when we landed in vegas he told me he expected cops to be waiting, thanked me for not calling the cops and tipped me $100."
52334	106	bq2sd5	eo0wsyi	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	ive got a couple from my time tour guiding at an aquarium. first, a barramundi (a very large fish), jumped out of an open tank and landed on the guest walkway. despite me telling everybody not to touch it and it would be fine until help got here, one man tried to throw it back in and cut his hand really bad on the scales. eventually the fish was returned to the water, but then we found the guest had hepatitis b, and nobody was sure how that would effect fish. next, the main exhibit to the aquarium is a giant reef tank. the guest walkway was about 7-8 feet above the water. three men and a woman drunkenly tried to hold the woman down so she could pet a sting ray. i thought they had to be joking because of how far the water down was, not to mention how deep in the water the stingrays were past that. they werent. security was called and they were escorted out of the building. ive since moved on to leading tours in a distillery. guest are really good about not touching anything. unless of course you tell them the machinery is hot, then they will touch it just to make sure.
52334	51	bq2sd5	eo16erx	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was a tour guide for a cave in a state park. we had two species of bats, one was common and one was endangered. this was also at the emergence of white nose syndrome which was wiping out a lot of bats. at the start of the tour, we would always tell the guests about the bats, how they're nothing to be afraid of, how to treat them, etc. one guest, a large male, pointed up in the corner of the entrance and asked me if it was one of the endangered ones. i said yes. he reached up and smashed it with his fist.
52334	52	bq2sd5	eo19ed0	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"not a tour guides, but out guide had a few interesting ones to share. we went on a school trip to berlin and visited a stasi (secret police in the ddr) prison. our guides were all people who have been imprisoned there and thus could tell us about their experiences in specific rooms ect. as a little note, you don't get in a stasi prison by normal crimes. they were reserved for people who tried to get out of the ddr and into the west (like our guide), were sympathizers of the west and their allies, smuggled or relayed information to the west or just had a different ethnicity, orientation ect. our guide always asks the same question at the start of each tour: ""why was a flat iron factory next to a prison?"" it was so they could open and check the mail unnoticed. any money, letters planning a break out or criticizing the ddr were ""lost"" that way. money was usually pocketed and the letters destroyed. so one day this older dude gets it right within seconds and our guide was of course fairly surprised. when asked, the guy revealed that he worked in the factory. as a side note, people who worked in those prisons or factories were no ordinary citizens. they were high ranking stasi officers, extremely on the side of the government and thoroughly checked so non of the people who worked there let anything ""slip"" about the existence of such prisons (they were on ""government property"" and weren't charted so the general population wasn't aware of their existence or use) turns out this guy was a stasi officer and as such also partook in torturing prisoners and ""sympathizers"". he was there without a ticket and after they called the police and had him removed, they found out that he had a history of walking in on tours and negate whatever the guides said about the unfair government. he also was on probation for defiling a few holocaust memorials and would harass guides of such tours."

52334	52	bq2sd5	eo1urcn	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	college tour guide at the biggest medical school in the state. this girl was top of her class, had a full ride, everything laid out for her. were touring the anatomy labs as a group, the room is full of cadavers in body bags. its a creepy room. she asks can i take a selfie with one of them? i told her absolutely not, these were people and that would be incredibly disrespectful to them and their families. she nods like she understands, then when i turn my back, she unzips a bag, picks the guys head up, and snaps a selfie. obviously she was immediately removed from campus and her acceptance to medical school was revoked. the university was going to stop there, but she tagged the school in her instagram pic with the cadaver. they then notified every medical school in the country what she did. shell never be a doctor, all because of one selfie.

28060	9087	bqltzq	eo62qkp	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i posted to my local subreddit for a few weeks that i was going to play trivia every so often, looking for new friends. one time a guy comments sure, sounds like fun. so we're at trivia (with 2 other friends of mine) and i just immediately like him. i get him to follow us to karaoke after that. i messaged him a few times, found out he was on okcupid and was single and asked him out about a week or two later. been together almost 7 years now and married for almost 3! 
28060	18597	bqltzq	eo62ec0	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"right after college i moved to a new city by myself and i was having trouble meeting people. i ventured onto the city's subreddit and saw a meetup posted for a halloween pub crawl, so i decided to go. i told the group what costume i would be wearing and headed out. i got to the first bar a bit late, so i assumed the group had moved to the next one. the group saw me from the line for the next bar and called me over, but just as they did two very shady-looking guys who had apparently been following me since the last bar popped up from behind me and told me they were here to ""take me to the party."" one of the members of the reddit group i was going to meet stepped forward and said ""no, this is our friend, she's with us, you two can leave."" so, essentially a group of reddit strangers saved me from real-life strangers. that was five years ago, and the group i met that night and i are still super close even though only about half of the original group still lives in the same city. we groupchat and/or roast each other every day. i also met my so of 3+ years through the group, so thanks to reddit not only did i not get kidnapped but i also met most of my favorite people in the world."
28060	5901	bqltzq	eo5tjuu	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"my now-husband and i both responded to a thread looking for players for a particular roleplaying game, and time and commitments worked out so that we both ended up in the same group playing this game. we got to chatting outside the game when i'd mentioned something about my ex husband, who i still lived with at the time despite being divorced. my now-husband was confused about my living situation, so he asked me a few questions, we started chatting more and ended up playing in another game together. at the time i was single, but not really looking. and i'd told myself i wasn't going to do a long-distance relationship again (my first marriage had started long-distance as well), and in chatting about this, my now-husband joked and said ""i'm going to make you love me."" it went on for a few months after that, and in early 2014 we had a long chat by email and through skype, a lot of back and forth and eventually decided that okay, yeah, we'd try this thing. he was in the uk, i was in australia. i went to the uk for the first time ever to visit him at the end of 2015. i went back again at the end of 2016 and in january 2017 he asked me to marry him. that was also the weekend my ex husband died, so it was a very happy moment followed by several of the most traumatic weeks of my life. but my partner was so supportive and caring through the whole thing, i knew i'd made the right decision. i'd already sold my house in australia back at the beginning of 2016, and unfortunately shortly after my ex passed away, our dog also died. so there was very little tying me back to my home country. we prepared all the documents and requirements for planning a wedding and a fiancee visa for the uk, and in august 2018 my visa was granted. i quit my job of 10 years, got on a plane and arrived in the uk in september 2018. we were married in october, and my temporary residence was approved in january 2019. we've been living together since september. things aren't always perfect, but i'm happier than i'd been in a very long time. he's a very sweet man, i adore him to the ends of the earth, and i'm so happy that i get to spend (hopefully!) the rest of my life with him."
28060	4301	bqltzq	eo62m77	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had just moved to nz and the auckland sub was having semi regular meet ups. i decided to go and meet some new people. my partner was a local but had broken up with his girlfriend a few months prior and decided to go to the meet up for similar reasons. we made a good group of friends and ended up at a few outings together and started flirting. we started dating a couple months before my visa was up but could tell this had potential to be something special. we decided to move in together so that i would be eligible for a partnership visa and stay in the county. it made the relationship move pretty fast, but 5+ years later, were married, bought a house in auckland (a huge feat these days!), have a lovely 2 year old pupper, and just welcomed our baby girl into the world in march. we are so in love and have a wonderful, happy life together. all thanks to r/auckland having some meet ups at the local pub.

28060	1208	bqltzq	eo61mnc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i moved to another country to be an au pair after college and didnt know anyone who had ever been there. a boy in the city i was moving to asked if any americans wanted to get coffee or beer so he could practice his english. he shared his twitter profile so he seemed normal. i also read about how hard it was to make friends in norway so i was all over the idea of my first possible friend. he gave me a lot of good advice before i moved. he studied in the us as a college student so had some good points of help. three weeks after i moved he invited me to a party, i got pretty wasted, and he let me sleep in his bed while he slept on the couch. a month later we were dating and six months later we were engaged. a year later he moved to the us and a week after that we got married. now, four years later, we have a cute puppy with a heart shaped nose and we will go back to norway for his 30th this summer. i only started using reddit to ask questions before i moved to another country but since it brought me to meet my person i figured its worth sticking around on. major shoutout to r/norway *edit: meet bandit here: https://imgur.com/d2zoavb

28060	2387	bqltzq	eo5r5qs	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"never on reddit, though i'd consider there are a couple of people i've interacted with on here enough that i actually care about them. i met one girl on a message board a long time ago though. not like, ""met a girl and wanted to bang"" but someone who liked the same bands as me and was actually interesting to talk to. i've been talking to her for 25 years and never met her. she knows all about my life, family, ups / downs etc - and i about hers. i'd say it's a truly pure and amazing friendship. outside my immediate family the most important to me. she literally is a best friend who doesn't really judge and actually cannot judge, and i know i truly care about and cares about me. it's one of my few constants in this world."
28060	2345	bqltzq	eo5yv5z	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on a writing subreddit. started talking, and talking turned into getting to know each other. i wasnt 100% sure i wanted to really start a relationship, and i honestly tried to end things and just walk away, but he sent me a really sweet, heartfelt message (on valentines, of all days) and i realized, huh, maybe this guy does like me, and hes actually been paying attention/learning about me. fast forward 2 months, and after weeks of asking, i tell him he can take me out on a date. he drives 7 hours to come see me. god, we were both so nervous. he could barely talk and i couldnt shut up. he kissed me in the parking lot (my first kiss!) and spent the weekend with me. that was over 2 years ago- weve been living together nearly a year, have 2 fur babies, and im more in love with him now than ever. hes the best choice i ever made. best little orange envelope ever. 
28060	1671	bqltzq	eo5qti7	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	**edit:** sorry if this reads kind of funny i'm using voice to text. we met on the organic chemistry subreddit i used to post there a lot when i was a tutor and help people work through problems and reaction mechanisms. she asked me a lot of really good questions and i enjoyed it explaining them to her. her curriculum was relatively hard for being in o-chem i, so i asked which school she went to. turns out we went to the same school and figured it would be easier to meet in person for tutoring. instantly knew i really liked her she was smart funny loved to workout and had huge ambitions. i told her as soon as i knew my feelings about her and she replied in a text saying i really like you too. but that was it she didn't say anything else which really confuse me. after like four or five hours of neither person saying anything i texted her saying so do you like me enough to date me? she said that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend but that she liked me more then just a friend. after telling her that i liked her i stopped charging her for our tutoring session and just did it because i enjoyed teaching her and the conversations that we would have throughout. after about four months towards the end of the semester she finally told me that she thought she really liked me too and wanted to give this relationship thing a chance. it's been an amazing 3 years and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with his girl. **edit:** also, before people start making puns. yes, i know we have chemistry.
28060	354	bqltzq	eo65u8p	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	posted on /r/r4r looking for an nfl watching buddy. since im a woman, i received upwards of 100 messages (any woman thats ever posted on that sub knows how it is, but i made it harder on myself posting about a male-dominated hobby). for some reason one guy in particular stuck out. we messaged on and off and for brief periods of time for about four months. from then on we started chatting a lot more consistently. i had already developed a thing for him. and then i found out he lived in my dream city on top of it! 2100 miles apart and somehow we made long distance work for three years. after ten visits back and forth, this past december my dog and i moved in with him. hes sitting beside me right now. :)
28060	460	bqltzq	eo5rrew	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	not through reddit but i saw reddit in the bookmarks of a now really good friend, when we met not long ago, so i started talk about it, now joke about reddit and memes. it's cool, it's the only guy who understands my irl memes references. but we don't know each other's username.
28060	716	bqltzq	eo614nf	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was a high school graduate and extremely bored so i decided to stay up all night and get donuts at stupid early in the morning. i really wanted someone to talk to to keep me awake, so i browsed r/r4r for people around my age (let's be honest, i was looking for guys around my age lol). i messaged a handful of people and talked to the first ones who messaged back. there were about 3, one guy i talked to all night until i realized he was a frat boy douche, and 2 others who didn't really interest me because we didn't have the same, well, interests. i ended up messaging one of them back anyway, since i still had a couple hours to kill. he lived in pa and i lived in co. we got along just fine, but i still wasn't very interested. he asked if we could skype later that day, and i almost completely blew him off again. but i decided to give him a chance, and we skyped while playing minecraft together later that night. we had a blast and we talked for hours and hours and hours for several days. after a week or so, he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes. we met in person a couple months later and clicked instantly. we would visit each other a couple times a year until about 2 1/2 years ago, when we finally moved in together! our 5 year anniversary is in about a week. :)

28060	323	bqltzq	eo5uiuu	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my boyfriend on the /r/meetpeople subreddit 2 years ago we became friends and became officially a couple 1,5 year ago. its amazing to me how someone can become such an important part of your daily life. even though he is so far away i have never felt this close to anyone before. something that i really like is that we communicate in a respectful way even if there is conflict. we try and always be open and honest, and i believe we are both very empathetic to each others feelings and struggles :)

"i found the woman that took care of my father before he died. i had never met nor seen a photo of my father my entire adult life. long story short, i knew his name, his social security number and that he was born in marseille, france. posted something to reddit private investigators - a few days later, a fellow redditor on that forum gave me a name and phone number of someone that was listed as relative or close friend (he did this for free). i called her and she returned my call. thanks to that great man / redditor i later exchanged letters with ""rose"", she told me how my father died of dementia, how they met, sent me photos of my father and my distant sister (i never knew i had). it was closure of not knowing him, not ever seeing photos and details on a chapter of my life i never thought i would know. so, yes, reddit can be a great and powerful tool thanks to a great community."

"met on a subreddit's discord server during a strange time in my life. we and a few others branched off into our own group, played video games together and some nights there'd just be three of us sat up late at night talking about anything. sometimes the other guy went to bed, other times we all went off at the same time. i fell for this guy on his voice and personality at first - as odd as that sounds, he was such a *nice* person to be around and talk to, and he had a nice voice. when he sent me a photo of himself he was also very much my type. a short while later, i get tired of dropping hints hoping he'd ask me or initiate the ""romance talk"", so i took the bull by the horns and told him how i felt. he admitted he'd never actually considered an ldr, took a few days to process and then he got back to me and admitted i'd been on his mind a lot and he felt he was starting to feel the same way about me. we've been together for nearly two years now, in an ldr that's about 400 miles apart. we're closing the distance in less than 7 weeks time now, though. i can't wait :)"

28060	138	bqltzq	eo60isw	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my life coach on reddit. my ~nascent~early comments made me sound like a poster boy for /r/iamverysmart . he pm'd, diagnosed my obvious insecurity and over the course of several years helped me stop giving a fuck what people think of me.
28060	38	bqltzq	eo6b0d6	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	my fiancee and i met through an r4r post i made on a throwaway account. we were starting to click , but then i sent a picture of myself and didn't hear back from her for over a week. considering we we're sending messages back and forth a few times a day, i was pretty certain i scared her off with how i looked. so i sorta gave up and didn't log back into that account for almost a month. if it weren't for me just checking to see if i ever got any messages, i don't think we ever would've met. turns out she was just really late sending a response and picture back to me. in a panic i messaged her immediately. after our near-miss with each other, we slowly built up to meeting in person and it's been awesome ever since. that was over 5 years ago and we're getting married next winter :)
28060	115	bqltzq	eo62cul	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	it took me 4 minutes to figure out what so means. yes i am a certified idiot. it means significant other wth

28060	26	bqltzq	eo6e23l	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	wasnt on reddit, but i had a friend i met on myspace around 2005, and we kept in touch for a decade or so, sharing band recommendations and chatting. since we lived across the country from each other, neither of us sought any kind of relationship with the other. we tried to meet whenever one of us would be in or around the others neck of the woods, but it just never happened. i was diagnosed with cancer about five years ago, and he determined that he had to do whatever it took to meet me before it was too late. my mom and i were vacationing a few states away, and he drove several hours to hang out. we all had a great time and it was hard for us to say goodbye, especially after the short visit wed planned ended up extending all the way into the next morning (with encouragement from mom and even our airbnb host). we planned a longer visit after i flew home, and spent a wonderful ten days together, after which he asked if i wanted to be in a relationship with him. i declined because i was afraid that, if my cancer killed me in a few years, he wouldve wasted his time when he couldve been with someone in better health. my ex felt that i shouldve been grateful he stuck around after my diagnosis, so i wanted to spare anyone else the burden of being with me. to my surprise, this wonderful man insisted he wanted to be with me no matter what challenges lay ahead. weve been together almost three years, and not once has he made me feel unworthy or unloved despite all my flaws (hair loss, surgery scars, er visits, and other fun problems caused by the cancer or medication). we got married last december and im currently in the process of selling my place and moving to the new house he bought for us. we may have met on myspace, but reddit is one of the main things we bond over now.
28060	47	bqltzq	eo60la6	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my boyfriend on a video game subreddit looking for people to play with. i made a post and got a solid handful of replies but for some reason, his was the only one i responded to. we ended up playing and talking that night and it didn't stop until the early morning. it felt so easy and so. right. i never vibed with someone like that before. i felt like he was my other half. in fact, he (thankfully) felt the same way and we've been dating ever since! it's been 1.5 years and i'm still just as giddy over him as that first night. i've never been happier. i love him so much. 
28060	23	bqltzq	eo69887	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"i'm a subscriber to /r/c25k, despite not ever completing the couch-to-5k program or running on a consistent basis. it's a pretty small sub, and most posts are post-run selfies, i like to see people try to better themselves and i'd like to think i'll complete the program someday. one day on that sub i saw a before and after pic of this guy who lost almost 100 lbs. the comments were full of op answering people's questions and giving really kind, thoughtful advice - and honestly, i thought he was really cute. in a few comments he also mentioned striking out on okcupid, so i thought ""fuck it"" and sent him a message with a link to my okcupid profile. turns out he was super interested, and a few weeks later his favorite band happened to be playing a show in my city and he flew out from texas to california to see them and meet me. we hit it off amazingly and were long distance for about a year - 2000 miles away from each other. three weeks ago he moved to california to be with me. i couldn't be happier or more in love, i honestly thought love like this was a myth before i met him. we both talk all the time about how lucky we are to have found each other. /u/trenta_is_not_enough i love you!"
28060	67	bqltzq	eo5ssvc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met someone on r4r that i dated for a few months. we have since broken up, but it was nice while it lasted. i talked to a lot of interesting people on r4r. it's kind of a bummer when the conversation just fades away though.
28060	85	bqltzq	eo60p7w	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	no story i just wanted to post and say it's nice reading all these good stories thanks for warning my heart a little today reddit.
28060	21	bqltzq	eo659pp	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i started playing a video game called digital paintball 2 around 2006 (i was around 12/13) and happened to play and team with mainly people in na (am eu), which lead to several years of awkwardly timed gaming sessions. met a group on that game i got on with very well, and eventually (in 2010ish) one of their girlfriends. theyd ask me if i had any plans to be in their cities or states at some point, as we became very good friends playing games for so many years. i told the couple id come to their wedding if they ever got married, which at the time they kinda brushed off. &#x200b; a few months ago they told me about their engagement and told me theyd love it if i could come. so, im all booked to go to their wedding in boston in july. its wild, i played games with and just generally spent a huge amount of time with these people, and now i finally get to keep my promise and see these two people i have a great deal of love for get married. they invited me to their pre and post wedding family celebrations, so im super excited to share in their special time.

28060	20	bqltzq	eo62mar	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	dont give me hope, i want to be hopeless.
28060	42	bqltzq	eo63sv0	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	honestly this would be great platform to meet your so. we share a lot of life struggles that people have also been through. ive been on reddit for a few months and people on here are really nice and give good input. ive been really comfortable reading through some subreddits because ive seen some people who are going through the same shit i am.
28060	17	bqltzq	eo5udjn	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met some former roommates on reddit. they were cool guys. left a bong on the porch a lot which made me paranoid. but cool guys.
28060	18	bqltzq	eo6cpxc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my husband in r/loseit and we both lost it and gained each other
28060	17	bqltzq	eo6h6qz	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	the simple story: we were both in relationships with other people who were absolutely horrible. i made a post on an r4r subreddit specifically looking for a hookup. his genuineness was just so tangible in his message and we were in the same (ethically non-monogamous, the fact that we were with shitty people became apparent later) situation that i felt drawn to him right away. this was strange for me because i was also posting on other subreddits (r/gonewild[fill in the blank], which i met my ex on)that had me interacting with tons of guys on the daily due to the explicit stuff i was posting. so i was desensitized and kinda disillusioned by guys pickup lines (even the ones that seemed polite and nice) we meet. we hookup. i stay the night, mostly because we lost track of time and connected right away. were *very* different people but also extremely the same. we get breakfast the next day. i go home and think about him the entire week. the next week he breaks up with his girlfriend. the week after that, i break up with my boyfriend. we dont have a talk about being official right away because it just doesnt seem important. he says i love you very soon and i say it back because i feel it and i mean it. two months later, and i had drawers of things at his place. a little more time and we meet each others families. we just got married today.
28060	60	bqltzq	eo65bhx	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was drunk one night and decided to look up the subreddit asainladyboners i scrolled down and the third picture caught my eye. this super attractive dude with a black suit on and long hair made my jaw drop. i had to send him a message even though i knew i would never hear back he was way out of my league. not only did he message back but weve been dating for almost a year and he treats me like a queen. im so lucky.
28060	70	bqltzq	eo69q2h	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	well my story may be the weirdest one among all these. i was going through a phase where i was hitting the gym very often and getting some really good results, combine this the fact that i have a small ego that needs confirmation through posting pics of myself online.eventually i am posting myself to the r/guysgonewild sub with full body showing but nothing too explicit (genitals are covered). next thing i know i am on the front page of the sub and an inbox full of messages from females and males alike (50-50 ratio), a lot of them just wanted to sext and as a straight male i obliged and had some fun with the girls over snapchat or what have you. however i should note that i never respond to these messages asking for sexts or anything, i simply have genuine conversations with most of them and it ends in sexting in most cases. one girl however never got to the point of asking me for sexual favors and instead we spoke a lot about the meaning of life and how crazy this reality of a universe we live in is, we even got into deeper quantum mechanics than i have with any other person before. i was very much falling for her and she reciprocated the same feelings for me, we exchanged numbers and ended up texting each other daily and eventually calling each other every night for months. a year or so later i move out of my parents place and decided to rent an apartment with her. today we are still together going on 2 years soon and feel like we are each others soul mates lol
28060	14	bqltzq	eo65en4	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met playing with the same guild in everquest. played together as friends for somewhere around 3 years with the guild and in groups. a handful of us met for a weekend and just hung out. my guy and i end up really clicking. a little later a bunch of us decided to meet irl, so we planned this big guild meeting in vegas. there were like 30 or so of us. he and i both stayed an extra day and walked around, talked, just enjoyed each other's company. after that we were seldom apart for more than a few days. he moved to my state,i moved to the city he moved to. we've been together just short of 20 years now, and 4 kids(2 from a previous marriage)are still crazy in love and i couldn't imagine anyone more perfect for me and our kids.
28060	41	bqltzq	eo60vp9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	hmmm. my queer platonic partner met me in the comments of a youtube video because she recognized my username from reddit, does that count?
28060	43	bqltzq	eo6186j	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	how do you even meet people on reddit? arent you all bots?
28060	29	bqltzq	eo65r3n	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we are getting married tomorrow! we met when we were both going through a challenging time and became friends. eventually it evolved and i moved to be with him. we both thank our lucky stars for that chance encounter! we have been together for three years now and also just purchased a home! things are great right now!
28060	13	bqltzq	eo66mtq	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met a very good friend on a small cancer sub about a year ago. we both had the same cancer and a lot of other uncannily coincidental things in common. talk every day now. /u/justpickedaname
28060	11	bqltzq	eo6c8la	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on /r/r4r. i was looking to meet a girl and my so responded. she was local which was pretty cool and we sent long messages back and forth for a few days. i had not been having great experiences with my dates from okcupid and she mentioned she had some bad experiences dating too and she was just really looking for friends. i was kind of tired of the whole dating thing myself (it's super exuasting mentally and emotionally) so the just friends thing sounded pretty good to me. we started hanging out pretty regularly pretty soon after we met up. her best friend came along a lot too. we had a bunch of fun and where hanging out several times a week (which is a lot when you're a full time college student with a job and they live 50 minutes away). after about 3 or 4 months of casually hanging out we decided to go take a trip to a place 4 hours outside the city to go try out astrophotography. we did it twice within 2 weeks for a total of 16 hours of driving so we got to just talk a lot. we opened up with each other and shared a lot of personal stuff during the drives and really got to know each other on a more real level. i just remember on the way back from one of the trips after conversation had died down just sitting there and thinking how awesome she was and how much i liked her. about 2 or 3 weeks later we ended up officially dating and have been going strong for almost 3 years now. come to find out she was thinking the same thing during our star gazing trip. it was the moment we both knew we wanted each other. i just moved states for a job this weekend and she put in her 2 weeks notice last week and will be joining me in my new apartment very soon :).
28060	12	bqltzq	eo759kn	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"a few years ago i was a moderator for a national subreddit. a most excellent dude (hi /u/jorgander ) posted a message saying ""i will be visiting your beautiful country later this year, do you guys want anything from the states?"" people made their requests, and some time later, the most excellent dude posts again, saying ""ok, i had a great time here, i am leaving today, and i want to drop off all the goodies you guys asked for."" the girlfriend of another mod and myself went there, let the most excellent dude know he was, in fact, a most excellent dude, picked up the loot (a huge bag, nearly broke my skinny back carrying it), divvied it up (we have a saying, he who shares gets a bigger share), and then i set up a meet to get everybody their stuff. as the meet began, it was the sausage party you'd expect from a reddit meet, and then *she* walks in. she had red hair and wore a star trek shirt. those were the first things i noticed about her. she noticed my dr who t-shirt. more people show up, beer is drunk, shit is shot, good times are had by all. the girl tells me she has to go, and i, despite being in a drunken stupor, go ""well it's raining, i have an umbrella, i'll walk you to a cab."" on the way to the cab, i tell her ""okay, gonna need to kiss you like, right now."" she goes ""damn, i've been dropping hints all evening."" lol wat. i haven't trained for this. anyway, that was seven years ago yesterday. two years ago today we were in church saying ""i do"", and today she's making french toast for the kid. that reddit meet led directly to the best days of my life."
28060	10	bqltzq	eo63phv	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	its long distance, we met in a destiny lobby and she shouted at me for being a horrible warlock but then friended me afterwards. weve been a couple ever since. shes always part of my fire team. i still suck at warlock
28060	39	bqltzq	eo65ap9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my bf of 5+ years on reddit through r/gonewild. i posted naughty pics (on a throw away account, so don't bother trying to scroll back in my post history, you'll be disappointed because its mostly animal crossing and pics of succulents) and he responded being funny and nice instead of ~~with a dick pic~~ sleazy/gross/objectifying. i replied back, and we chatted all night, learned we lived about an hour away from each other, eventually shared face pictures. in the morning i sent a video to his kik or whatsapp or whatever was the texting app of choice at the time saying my name, his name, and some specific detail we mentioned the night before to prove i wasn't a catfish. after two weeks of texting, we met up in person and have been dating ever since. moved in together two years ago. we had a friend who worked at reddit hq for a while, and he mentioned this story to alexis ohanian at some point, which he loved. we met him at a talk he did a while ago and asked if he would officiate our wedding and he agreed depending on his availability. i told him we're not engaged yet so our calendar is pretty flexible haha
28060	12	bqltzq	eo6008i	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	upvoted cause im curious about this!
28060	9	bqltzq	eo63ar3	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my girlfriend through a friend making subreddit roughly 2 years ago. we talked on and off again for about a year and then this past december we really got to know each other while we were both going through some shit. we met up irl at the end of april and started dating a few days later.
28060	9	bqltzq	eo63f25	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met a guy on reddit that was looking for someone to play games with. we played some games and got along so we kept playing and chatting here and there. he always seemed a little off but it didn't affect anything as far as what we were doing so it was whatever. well one day we get to talking about our pets somehow and he just starts casually talking about how he adopts cats and if they aren't good enough for him he kills them for fun, survival of the fittest and all that. i told him he was fucked up and haven't talked to him since.
28060	10	bqltzq	eo66h9h	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	almost a year ago i was in one of the darkest depressions of my life. i told the guy i was sort of dating at the time (he never called me his girlfriend because he wasnt ready) i was thinking pretty seriously about killing myself. i wasnt trying to play him for sympathy, but i was very afraid and never had such obsessive thoughts about it before. he was worried for maybe a day, then blew it off. one night i felt particularly low, and for the first time ever looked for someone online. i went through dozens of posts on a sub for people meeting each other and chatting using the app kik. i chose the one i felt was the most sincere, albeit a little sad, downloaded the app, and sent that person a message. 258 days later, that guy who didnt care about me has dumped me twice, and ive cut him out of my life. this stranger i met on reddit and started chatting with on kik is my whole support system. we talk everyday and all night. last week he flew across the country to meet me and my cats, and we had a blast together. when im sad, he always knows just what to say and i am no longer in that dark frightening pit. were there for each other. im there when he is sad too. we plays lots of games together, and now weve even done that in person! he reads to me sometimes (because hes very eloquent) and i can tell him all my secret. he likes to watch me draw sometimes when i work up the courage to do so. now i can say i have a boyfriend who loves me!
28060	9	bqltzq	eo66ji5	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had a really terrible 2012 and in january 2013 thought fuck it, let's try online dating. tried match.com, eharmony, all of the basics. kept hitting steep paywalls or questionnaires that were unnecessary and uncomfortable. so i said fuck it, reddit's got to have an answer to this. and i found /r/r4r . i typed a quick post, exchanged messages with a lot of really weird people, and one stuck out. messaging on reddit turned into texting turned into skype turned into him driving 16 hours to northern minnesota in the dead of winter so we could meet. met on reddit in january, in person in march, i moved to him in september and we married in october. he is amazing. i don't want to embarrass him so i can't brag too much but i have an incredible husband and we have a great life together.
28060	8	bqltzq	eo6r1h3	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	in december 2011, i got out of a. sub-optimal relationship, and i was looking for a new adventure. i posted on /r/idliketobeatree, a smallish community i'd found refuge in, saying i was taking a road trip from wichita to nyc, and that i'd like to meet up with people from the sub along the way. one person responded, and we met just outside of st. louis, mo. he was a mod of the subreddit, and we skyped a few times beforehand, so i found myself trusting him. found out he was moving to a town in kansas only a half hour away from me, and barely a month later we started a beautiful relationship, the best five years i've ever known. he showed me what it means to be truly good and kind. i'm so grateful i took a chance on a random sub.
28060	8	bqltzq	eo5ugax	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i have met and made friends with multiple people on this website but never dated, sadly
28060	7	bqltzq	eo69mgt	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we didn't exactly meet on reddit but i have gotten her on reddit now! we met on a site called emerald chat, she thought i was this young girl because of my personality. but our talk on the website was great, added each other in there, talked more. now we exchanged skypes and within 1 week of having each other on skype i told her that i loved her because i didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell my feelings for her, especially when you don't know what the next day entails for such a distance. i'm in the us and she's in malaysia so the time difference was massive and she's busy with university. we've had our ups and downs but we keep pushing through it. a year in i had the weird idea of giving her a middle name as malay's typically don't have middle names. so we went through some names and picked out one she likes, and she's absolutely in love with it now. the way she smiles when i refer to her as that name just makes my heart tick faster. i fall asleep in calls with her all the time and she puts up with it and finds it calming just watching me sleep, hell. before we were dating we fell asleep together in a voice call on skype. i can't say i regret because i don't. i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her. thanks for putting up with the flow of my short story. i know it's a bit chaotic.
28060	8	bqltzq	eo6ae33	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	it was the midnight premier of the first avengers movie. a bunch of friends and i went to go see it. my theater was having a marathon of the movies before it, i decided i wanted to sneak in to see them. my friends did not so i went in to watch captain america alone. after a while they started texting me telling me that there was a girl sitting in front of them who had the exact same interests as me, doctor who, mlp, etc and i should come meet her. i was reluctant at first, but then they started calling me and i had to leave the theater. i met this girl, she was lovely, we traded numbers, and we've been together for 7 years now, got married almost two years ago
28060	7	bqltzq	eo6ay8x	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was going to a university far away and posted on reddit about the hall i would be staying in. someone commented they were also staying in that hall. we chatted for a bit and then said we would see each other there. 4 months later after completely forgetting about this interaction i started dating this girl and about 2 weeks in she was talking about someone she has been trying to find in our hall who she talked to on reddit a few months ago. i connected the dots, brought up my comment history and asked her if that was her. so turns out, out of all 300 people i could have got with, i chose the one that i chatted to on a unanynous website without even knowing.
28060	7	bqltzq	eo6bmdk	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i found out about a drunk knitting circle from my citys subreddit and im going to the first meeting on tuesday, so hopefully ill make some new friends!
28060	6	bqltzq	eo6oypf	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my current girlfriend about a year ago. i followed her on instagram before i texted her, and always thought she was cute. well one night i was drunk and my good friend had a picture of them on his story (hes gay, i didnt steal her from him) and i said fuck it, im drunk, i got nothing to lose and 2 days later we met in person. we avoided the entire awkward stage because she was baked when i met her, and i was drunk. we just acted like we knew each other for years and its never changed.
28060	6	bqltzq	eo6p7cl	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i came across a comment where someone was talking about having published their book on amazon. since i'm always looking for book suggestions, i asked them if they could pm me their book link so i could check it out. after about a year of us spending time long distance and making trips to each other, she moved to where i live. i just proposed to her earlier this year and we get married in a few months!
28060	7	bqltzq	eo77yf4	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"dec 2017, i moved in a new city, a university town in the middle of proverbial nowhere. it's a small city by my standards (population of 300k here vs the 5m tourist city where i just was vs the 13m capital city where i grew up). i don't speak the local language(s), the pocket community that does speak english are families and religious people, and had a hard time looking for my own crowd. i saw a thread talking about the city, someone said that ""so-and-so city is dank"" and i jumped ""where is the dankness,"" because the city is nothing but bars and sand and bars and more sand and sometimes camels (it's in the edge of the desert). before i arrived, i also made a similar post in the same sub before about what to do in the city. this guy pops in and suggests places to go to, then he messages me if we could hang out sometime. i've hung out with people from reddit before, they were mostly cool, so i was like, sure. he didn't know i was a girl. been dating ever since, moved in october last year, and he's a sweet, wonderful man who's probably reading this post in a few hours because we openly stalk each other's reddit profiles. ^^^^hey. ^^^^get ^^^^to ^^^^work."
28060	26	bqltzq	eo5ymld	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	he messaged me after i posted something on a religious dating subreddit. we met up the next time he was in town and the rest is history! never met a guy like him in my life, let alone with the same values and stuff. its been about 8 months of long distance, but that will hopefully be changing really soon!
28060	8	bqltzq	eo5ueoy	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met her after she moved away from my high school, how convenient right? we actually learned we had a lot in common and skyped and facetimed everyday and always talked about thing in life. that was freshman and sophomore year. finally she moved back because her dad found a new job here and we have officially started to be together. i couldnt think a week we havent spent together.
28060	6	bqltzq	eo64fpc	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my partner of five years here, i made a post looking for friends on r4r and he responded. we texted for a month or two then i went to seattle to meet him. at that point we started hanging out every so often as friends. eventually we moved to dating after we both realized we wanted more and now it's been over five years since we started officially dating. not a fairy tale love story but we work well together and he's the best thing to happen to me :)
28060	6	bqltzq	eo65wxk	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my current boyfriend on r/makenewfriendshere. neither of us saw it coming, especially since he was in a relationship when we met, but things started to flourish after he became single. i live in germany and he lives in the uk, and we make it work quite beautifully.
28060	6	bqltzq	eo663qn	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my dentist through reddit. got about $15k in free dental work. including braces.
28060	6	bqltzq	eo68i8a	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	6 months ago, i went on a date with a girl i met on a dating app. she tells me that i remind her of one of her friends. she tells me that this friend is armenian, like me. she tells me her friend is into classic cars, like me. she sent me a photo of this beautiful 1967 chevy impala that belonged to her friend. she tells me ive got the same sense of humor as her friend. heck, she says if we dont work out, maybe ill set you up with her!. long story short, we didnt work out. one day, weeks after that date, im scrolling through r/classiccars. low and behold i see a photo of this gorgeous blue 1967 impala get posted. something about the photo sticks with me. it hits me that this is the exact same photo the girl sent me. im thinking no way! this has to be her armenian friend. i take a chance and send a pm to her. i was right, it was the same person i thought it was. she sent me her number to talk cars, and talk we did! turns out we have almost everything in common. we made each other laugh like crazy. we have the same sense of humor. were both artists in our own way. we both love classic muscle cars. we both love 90s music. we both basically have the same train of thought. she used to work at the company i work at now. were both in tech. we both struggled with past relationships. we send each other the exact same gifs at the same time. her weird is my kinda weird. we also both have insanely bushy armenian eyebrows (but she takes care of hers). we went on a date and within an hour, we were saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. seriously, at least once a day we say the same thing at the same time. weve been together ever since. i found my soul mate on reddit. i found my life partner. i found someone i never knew could be so incredible (and real) on reddit. so thank you reddit! and more importantly thank you u/youllregreddit for responding to a spontaneous, weird, anonymous message on reddit 6 months ago, and i cant wait for the rest of our lifetimes together!
28060	5	bqltzq	eo697y9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met 4 years ago today! (well, it was sunday 17th may 2015) i posted in our local sub in the april about a meetup and we ended up doing our own instead. 4 years later, we are amazingly happy. he lives with me and we just had a lovely day today with our blended family - my daughter, his son, his mum, and the two of us all sat outside in the garden having tea. we are so happy and grateful to reddit for bringing us together.
28060	6	bqltzq	eo69hc9	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my now husband on r/loseit in 2012. i was in the chat talking to everyone and happened to mention i was australian. husband said he loved utes and was obsesssed with holden cars. we struck up a friendship and spoke almost every day for years. i moved instate and the communication kinda died off. i was so upset by it but life was crazy for me and i was isolated from family and friends. in 2016 our communication started up again and i realised that what i had been feeling was more than just friendly feelings towards him. but how would it work? he was in florida and i was in australia. it seemed impossible. one night, we were having a deep and meaningful conversation and he told me he had feelings for me. i was so happy! i told him i absolutely felt the same and we decided we would do whatever it took to make this work. i met him in person in march 2017 when i flew over and spent a month with him. we were exactly the same in person as we were on skype/chat. he came to australia last year for two weeks and i got to show him the now closed holden factory and he got to hold a koala and feed kangaroos. it was so much fun. in july he proposed to me via video chat (which was perfect for my introverted self) and of course i said yes. we were married when i flew there for xmas last year and have now filed for the cr1 visa. the 16 month wait until we close the gap as begun!!!
28060	6	bqltzq	eo6aedx	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met on /r/ohior4r. no lie, i was cruising for booty, she was looking for a hookup and casual dating. she made a post, i noticed it about a week after she posted but i figured i would try anyways. i pmed her and asked if she was still looking, she wrote back about an hour later saying she was. we got to texting, things got flirty, we exchanged some pictures and decided wed go out to dinner that night. dinner was great, full of great conversation. then we get done and i walk her to her car. we starting making out pretty hard and then she says, i guess i can take you home. we get to her place and instantly get into some hot and heavy sex. we ended up having sex four times that night, and we kept it up for the next month. after a month of wild sex and hanging out, we found out we had a ton of things in common. we started officially dating in may of 2015, and were still together now. in fact im going to propose to her this year.
30729	2313	blna2q	emqmxqo	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my high school gf worked there way back in the day. she said the worst part of the day was having to collect merchandise from the fitting rooms and cleaning the fitting rooms. apparently, all sorts of nasty women would go in there and try on the panties, not use a liner and just generally leave them all crusty and bad smelling. they would also leave pads and tampons all over. she said they had to throw away so much merchandise that was left in that condition. i feel like this may be a problem anywhere they sell clothes but then again hot topic may attract a different type of customer so it might have happened more often?
30729	773	blna2q	emqtabw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at a hot topic in '99-'00. we used to get a fair amount of strippers that came in because we were the only place around that sold see-through vinyl bikini tops and 6 inch stack boots and shit like that. anyway, our fitting room was basically a hole cut in a wall with a mirror and a thick curtain that had to be pulled close just right. this one day, a stripper came in to try on a bunch of stuff and really didn't even bother with the curtain. apparently, she was so used to people seeing her naked that it wasn't a big deal for her. granted, this was a weekday morning and she and her boyfriend/manager/bodyguard or whatever were the only people in the store besides my manager and me. at one point she just stopped using the fitting room altogether and was just using the full length mirror on the door to the stockroom/office. my manager and i really had no idea what to do, because at this point she's got about $1500-$2000 worth of merchandise that she's probably buying, and this lady is good for both business *and* morale. she didn't seem to be worried at the prospect of anyone seeing her, and the way our store was set up was really narrow and long, and the display fixtures were tall and bulky. it was very difficult to see into and out of the store unless you were standing in the center aisle. it made loss prevention a nightmare, but really allowed this lady to let her freak flag fly. she finally puts her clothes on at the cash wrap as she's checking out. my manager gave me so much shit after that because i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact with the customer while i rang her up. that was the largest transaction i ever rang up in my time there, and paid for it with the largest wad of cash i'd ever seen in my life up to that point. **tl;dr a stripper came in on a slow day and treated the store like her own private dressing room.**
30729	1935	blna2q	emqsb8s	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at hot topic about 8 years ago. for the most part, the gig was the best part-time job i ever had. great managers, great coworkers, great customers. only 2 instances stand out in my mind. 1. this was around when twilight was big. middle-aged women would come in and ask where the edward/jacob merch was and then just start fawning over them in the most uncomfortable way. 2. my actual interview. it was a group interview. one of the questions was something about either a difficult customer service moment or something. this one guy (obvious ht scene type) proudly talks about the time he worked at a bookstore and sucker-punched a female customer in the face for calling his style weird/freaky/something. i never saw that guy again so i dont think he got the job.
30729	5258	blna2q	emqlur6	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"i worked for 2 years at my local hot topic and the worst stories both involved the fitting room. our fitting room used to be a self-service room in the back of the store with a red curtain in front of it. an employee noticed 4 feet in the room and opened it to find two people having sex in it and had to clean up the remnants. a second incident came when a smell wafted from the same room. it was later discovered that someone had actually taken a dump in the room when they went in to ""try on clothes"". we ended up fitted the room with a galvanized piece of chain and a masterlock to keep the curtain open. luckily, shortly thereafter, we got a full store overhaul that put in actual fitting rooms."
30729	6258	blna2q	emqlm8l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my current boss was a former store manager at a hot topic and he told me that he caught one of his employees stealing a shirt he had stuffed into a sonic cup. from then on out everyone had to check bags and beverages for merchandise.
30729	6705	blna2q	emqn6an	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	a petite friend is currently a manager at one and her issue is always a customer that become too-often repeat customer obsessed with her or another female employee. currently it's a guy that swears they would have everything in common because he likes all the things in the store too, as if she curated it, and now has to stay 500 feet from the store.
30729	11265	blna2q	emqmbsn	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a horror story but a ridiculous short one. i had a woman come in with her sleeping infant and screamed at me to turn off the music while she strolled around the store. i mean if your baby is sleeping and you want them to continue, maybe dont come to browse the store that you can hear music blasting from the other side of the mall, idk what to tell ya haha.
30729	1044	blna2q	emqt8cz	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	thursday is actually my last day with hot topic after 4 years! in general the company is amazing to its employees and ive met some incredible people. but boy do i have stories!! 1. i once found a condom on our anime section. it was open and filled with.something. 2. we had a girl who i am positive had some mental issue because she would get into the fitting room and try to lure anyone in there to help her then try and seduce them. she was actually pretty but young and filled to the brim with crazy. 3. alice cooper came into the store once. totally unannounced and brought a teacup pig. absolutely wonderful person. gave our metalhead associate tickets to his show and this dude about lost it. 4. also met machine gun kelly, mayday parade, we the kings, and max green of escape the fate. mgk and the vocalist for wtk were assholes. 5. we had a guy get thrown against the front gate on the morning of a funko pop release. in general the job has taught me some pop collectors are grads a assholes. 6. had a woman ask me if she should go back to stripping after her c section, then lifted her shirt to show me the scar and her tits. 7. we found out there was a group of mallrats who wrote fan fiction about the staff at our store. i never got to see any and im glad for that.
30729	2594	blna2q	emqofea	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was working on the sales floor and this guyat least in his 30s and pretty highstarts making sexual comments to me about this 15ish girl that was checking out. i asked him to leave and nothing more came of it but ich it was chilling. also had a co-worker get fired because they were selling weed out of the back room. shed sneak it into their bag while they were checking out. also had a different, off-duty, co-worker come in hammered late one night to tell everyone working how great we were. that was actually kinda nice. besides that, it was a lot of kicking out vaping teenagers and letting the quiet girls from my school try on skimpy harley quinn bikinis in the dressing room. edit:grammar
30729	15062	blna2q	emql2r3	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked there for 13 years. soooo much weird, but that's just retail in general. caught a guy masturbating into women's shoes in the dressing room. people had sex in there more often than you'd be comfortable with. i worked for them when columbine happened. we carried a brand of clothing back then called serial killer, which featured pop culture pics/references and some edgy saying, like a pic of bruce lee that said ""revenge"" or something like that. the morning after columbine happened, we got an email to pull all the serial killer clothing line off the sales floor, as well as every trenchcoat in the store. by the end of the day i'd already had to call security twice due to people showing up at the store and harassing me for 'supporting those psychos' and 'training the next ones'. then the tv networks showed up and pretty much camped the front of our store, harassing every customer as they walked in/out, asking them why this 'dark lifestyle' attracted them. the mall ended up having security just hang out in front of our store and walking our employees to their cars for a week afterward. honestly, it was the best job i ever had. the company was really supportive at the corporate level. i still have friends that work there. they pretty much left me alone so long as i made sales, so i had carte blanche to set up my stores the way i wanted even if it didn't look like the planned merchandising setups they sent out. i had direct access with every dept, so if i felt my stores couldn't sell something they sent us, they'd let me transfer it somewhere else, and vice versa, get more best sellers in. honestly, if it wasn't for the working every weekend and closing a lot stuff, i would have continued working there."
30729	4211	blna2q	emqku1l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee. i worked a whole 3 months in summer, so all the kids were out and about. i was stocking disney merchandise and i couldn't help but notice a kid underneath one of our clearance racks. i heard some strange noise coming from there too so i crouch under and look at the kid. he had a button, needle and all, in his mouth. i asked him where his parents were and before i knew it he swallowed the pin and ran out of the store. i couldn't leave and go search for the child so i let security know about the button kid. never knew what happened after that. i can't seem to forget button kid though.
30729	5353	blna2q	emqprnc	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"spent almost 5 years working at one in the early 2000's. being in the midwest, we had a ton of juggalos but they were actually pretty nice people in general. i had a group of kids ask what i would do if they ""set some clothes on fire"" and flicked a lighter multiple times. we mostly got weirdos who wanted to bang in the dressing room or lifted up their shirts to ask me what gauge their nipple ring is. we had this one girl who came in weekly and i dont think she was all there. she would sit at the listening station for way too long and then leave. one day she sat down and put the headphones on. she had a plastic bag with her filled with empty glass bottles and peaches (yes, the fruit). we noticed it was leaking onto the floor but just let her do her thing. she put the headphones back and looked at her leaking bag. she had a mildly disappointed look on her face but immediately looked at her watch and yelled ""i'm going to miss my bus!"". she ran out of the store and up to a trash can outside the store. she held the bag up high and yelled ""peaches meet your fate!!!"", threw the bag in the trash, and sprinted off. that job was weird."
30729	5277	blna2q	emqfs4l	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee of a couple years in high school. i loved that job. the biggest horror story that sticks out in my mind was this guy that would always come in with his kids. he was a huge icp fan, and from the looks of it, he let his kids (both boys, they were i'd guess maybe 7 and 8 at the time) listen as well. they always had hatchet man stuff on and pretty bitchin' haircuts. they always misbehaved, just running around the store screaming, sometimes crashing into stuff, and the dad gave no fucks. he was often pretty rude to us in the store about not having specific merch or being out of stuff in his size (he was a large guy.) i had and still have no business in what that guy does with his kids, but i always felt a little bad that there was a good chance they would end up in a bad way. other than that reoccurring instance, for the most part our store was really fun.
30729	6882	blna2q	emqjxie	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked for hot topic for about 7 years. my store was apparently the juggalo store of the district, and i think the state. working for that company as long as i did, i was pretty used to ignoring people's crappy taste, but the juggalos were different. this is in central florida, so it's on average about 90 degrees most days and always humid as hell. these kids were always very overweight, wearing a massive black icp tee, those ridiculous 30 pound black tripp pants with huge pockets and all the hardware (chains and straps) hanging from them, and they were drenched in sweat (their hygiene was almost always awful). they always seemed to show whenever a new icp shirt or collectible would arrive, and would smell up the store and pay in wadded up, sweat soaked money. it was just all around unpleasant. the smell would linger for a bit after they left. it was not pleasant.

30729	13148	blna2q	emqif06	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this is my time to shine. i was helping a lady at the disney section. she was pretty particular about the things she wanted and was asking if they looked okay enough for her. being my first job i was really enthusiastic about being a sales person and i really do love disney. so i was hyping her up the best i could and were laughing together, getting along really well. then she says, yeah i wanted to get all the same things my boyfriends baby mama has, is that weird? literally did not know how to respond. i said it wasnt and cashed her out quick.
30729	15765	blna2q	emqk09k	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this was my first job in my college town, and generally, i absolutely loved it. youre treated like some super cool mini-celebrity by all the little mall rats, the management was generally great to their employees, and the work wasnt too hard in my small, low volume store. however, there was the issue of valentines day. that year they were promoting all these different corsets and lingerie, as well as the get in our pants campaign for the skinny jeans. management wanted the employees to try and show the corsets not just as lingerie, but as fashion items, maybe paired with the skinny jeans. increase sales and all. so there i am, valentines day, in a black corset and tight black skinny jeans and boots. waaay more sexy than 18-year old me with a still-developing body was comfortable with. in comes creepy mccreeper, a 50+ something dude who says he wants to buy something for his wife, but wants some help picking it out. not once did his eyes look at my face. the entire time im helping him, hes staring at my ass or chest and making weird comments about how i remind him of his daughter, or being uncomfortably comfortable telling me explicit details about his wifes body. he then asks me to try it on and show him, so he could see how it would look on his wife. luckily, shy 18-year old me awkwardly laughed it off and got him past the register and out of the store. i loved that job but jesus, did it draw some weirdos.
30729	5620	blna2q	emqk0wq	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"maybe not so much horror, but just terribly annoying/cringy. 1. i was wearing a hellblazer shirt that had a cover of the new 52 revamp on it. i had two neckbeards come up and start trying to gatekeep me on if i was ""really"" a fan of hellblazer/john constantine. it included the actual questions of ""well, what's your favorite arc?"" ""who is your favorite writer/artist?"" 2. halloween is coming up. it's the halloween season after suicide squad came out, so we have both versions of the joker's outfits (the other from the dark knight). both versions were unreasonably expensive. in total for the dark knight costume, if i remember correctly was about $200 all together. because you had to buy the coat, the undershirt, the pants etc. the fabric of the costume was just a little bit better quality then the $50 version you get at any halloween setup store. we had a guy come in about 30 minutes before we closed for the night and wanted to try on the dark knight version of the joker's outfit. the costume was hanging up on the tallest rack so it required me getting a pole and pulling down each one because the size he needed was a large and each component of the costume. he tried it on, enjoyed it, and wanted to buy it. i went ahead to go ring him up and then when he saw the price of it he started flipping out. he started complaining that he could find this costume in anywhere else that he wanted at a cheaper price. he wanted to know if there's any coupons or if i could give him my employee discount. i told him there's no way i could do that. he starts flipping out and says he needs his costume tomorrow and he doesn't have that money now. he took me about 45 minutes after closing to finally leave. he did not buy the costume. even before suicide squad came out working halloween around hot topic was always cringey with all the joker and harley quinn people. edited to correct minor errors - was using speech to text to tell the story while feeding the baby. sorry!"
30729	10291	blna2q	emqhkvb	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	finally one of these where i have an actual personal story. i worked at one for about a year. you would see a lot of cringy stuff just because of the base it attracts, but nothing terrible horrible usually besides one time. i was working a saturday afternoon shift, it was about 3:30 pm and the store wasnt busy at all. there were only two weaboo looking guys in their 20s in the store. then, a group of four teens walked in giggling and looking suspicious. they go up to the weaboos and start singing the nyan cat song nyannyanyannyanyannyanyanyannyanyanyan!!!! me and my coworker are like what the fuck. one of the weaboos gets aggressive and is like step the fuck back! step the fuck back! he then fucking grabs a chain wallet and starts swinging it at them. i call security and my coworker is just screaming hey hey hey!!! trying to stop it. one of the kids calls the weaboos fat asses as hes still trying to hit them with the wallet, and responds to their insult by calling them daddys cum stain bitch asses. by now 3 security guards come in and break it up, while the silent weaboo is saying the kids started it. both parties are escorted out different exits while we give a report on what happened. never saw any of them again.

30729	170	blna2q	emqsqk7	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked at one seasonally for about 6 years through high school and college. absolutely loved working there. we had a customer come in who claimed he was a vampire. he dressed like an extra from interview with the vampire on a tight budget and went out of his way to insist that he was truly a vampire. he would occasionally corner employees to berate them about this. it happened to me while i was helping him find a new pair of boots. he cornered me by the changing rooms, told me all about the women he enthralls, and spoke in metaphors at me for about 15 minutes. i tried to be as polite as possible and feigned interest, but eventually he must have noticed i wasn't falling prey to his glamor so he switched to complaining about how he has two different sized feet and finding footwear is hard. outside of customers, we once had an absolute idiot as a manager. dude would come in and fall asleep on the tables in the stock room, or spend hours at a time in the bathroom and have us tell anyone looking for him that he's on a conference call. he'd also occasionally try to find ways to get mos'd merch out to his car. once, back when we had a cd changer for the in-store music, he brought in a bunch of cds from his car to play. one was blink-182's take off your pants and jacket. none of the album's he brought in we're censored, which we didn't actually think about until the intro the the bonus track ""fuck a dog"" came on. the store was pretty full, we both panicked, and i ended up jumping over the counter to get to the cd changer in time to hit skip. my toe caught the counter on my way over, throwing me off balance and causing me to drill my other foot toes-first into the floor. still skipped before anyone knew what was playing, though. edit: typo"
30729	993	blna2q	emqnpku	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	well i worked at the pac sun two stores down but knew the ht people pretty well as they were the only ones who also smoked cigarettes; if either were out of smokes we could get one from the other. hung out with the manager a few times at his place to smoke out etc. he was super into coheed and cambria and we'd jam out to that. had a wife and kid who were super nice and cooked dinner for me when i was there. end up moving and on a trip back home, i stop in to see if anyone i knew was still there. ask about manager dude and the person's face just drops. turns out dude was in prison for fucking a 14yo.

"former ht store manager here. at the height of the twilight craze, and when i was still a sales associate, we had a midnight release party for the first movie's dvd. people legitimately camped out in the mall to be at this event. generic twilight fans: 12-16 year old girls, their mothers, and the odd sprinkling of adults that were wildly out of place. employees were encouraged to dress up in twi merch, but me being 17 and engrossed in the suburban punk rock lifestyle, i did not participate. my sm was not pleased about this, so she mos'd (marked out of stock) an outfit for me. girls size small ""i  boys who sparkle"" tee that rode up like a crop top, the tightest jeans i've ever worn, and to top it all off, she aggressively applied eyeliner, sparkly eye shadow, and body glitter all over me. and before anyone asks or makes the whole process into something sexy, she was in her mid forties, overweight, and generally the most unpleasant person ever. it was humiliating, but the only saving grace is that i got so. many. phone. numbers that night. i was drowning in high school girls who thought i was amazing. nothing ever came from it though. i've got other stories, but i'm headed into my adult job now. if i remember, l will post a few more tonight. edit: rip my inbox. also, for clarity's sake, i am a dude."
30729	452	blna2q	emqpuyt	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i didn't work there very long, but i remember on my second day of the job a lady came in looking for something to buy her daughter. told me she was a fan of janis joplin, jimi hendrix, that kind of stuff. so i walked around with her for maybe an hour showing her all sorts of things she might like (this was back when hot topic was more music oriented in the early 2000's). we picked out a few really awesome things i thought she might like.and then the mom spotted a marilyn manson mini skirt. after hearing how her daughter dressed and what kind of music she listened to for upwards of an hour, i tried to tell the mom that her daughter probably wouldn't like that skirt. but she insisted and ended up getting only the skirt. it was my first retail job. something inside me died a little that day.
30729	19882	blna2q	emq5wtp	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was there for 4 years, so ill have to think about this for a bit. first story that comes to mind was my first halloween. corporate sent out calendars that were only on the shelf for maybe 3 hours. each month was a different serial killer. it had a picture, stats and sayings from each one. for instance, one month (june i believe) was ed gein. it had his kill count listed, and then basic bullet point facts about him. this was the first and only time i ever saw corporate had us field destroy merchandise. to this day i wish i had kept a copy. edit: it was 2007. i was only part time and i had only been there a few months. had i known how cool it wouldve been i wouldve taken one. or five. i had planned on buying one the second we unboxed them. thanks for all the likes!

"i managed 3 different hot topics in the late 90's/early 2000s. mostly i had a great time working there. i don't know that i have any horror stories, per se, but there was a lot of crazy shit that went on. in the main store i worked in, people (including staff) were constantly fucking in the changing room. teenagers would come in reeking of weed so strongly that you could smell them across the store. people were always coming in in bondage gear, on leashes, etc. which was pretty hilarious, because the store i was at was in a really suburban area. there was one guy that came for about a year, every weekend, asking about stiletto boots in a particular size that was really hard to find. finally, i managed to find a pair and got it shipped to our store. turns out they were for him. he was like maybe 5'5"" and 300lbs. probably the most memorable experiences was the time that a bunch of the raver kids (i say kids, i was like 21 at the time) convinced me to go out to a rave with them. the store manager was going (i was assistant), along with like 3 staff. the staffers were over 18, but still living at home, and at the end of they were too high to go home. so the manager (also still rolling) decided we could all just crash in the back of the store, since we had a bunch of bean bag chairs back there. ended up with lots of oral sex being exchanged."
30729	5737	blna2q	emqe8zu	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	didnt work there but i can bet your butt a hot topic employee cringed and laughed at me. when i was 10ish, i really loved to write. i was also going through that edgy phase (i think avril lavigne was getting big right around then). i was looking around the store, not really knowing what half the stuff was. they always had awesome bumper stickers, and i picked one up that said inkaholic. because i liked to write, you know, with ink. and i told the cashier as much when he asked me what the sticker meant. that was one of those things that i completely forgot about until several years later when it randomly popped in my head, and i realized how wrong i was. i hope he got a good laugh over me.

30729	354	blna2q	emqqam9	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh buddy. i have 8 years of stories that i can tell. mostly, the job was great. i loved most of my customers and my employees. my managers would vary on the years. one customer liked to get too friendly with the girls (most of which were under 18 and he was nearing 50) and id have to send them to the back so he wouldnt try to touch them. another guy that was known to be a shoplifter around the mall came in one day and stole from me. one of my cool customers chased after him and didnt get the stuff back, but did yell at security at being awful. i also got into yelling matches with the lazy mall security because they wouldnt do shit about this guy because they didnt see him steal. even though everyone else did. my first district manager was flat out cruel. when she left the company and came to the store to shop, i started having an anxiety attack because the backroom was a mess (it was the holiday, we were understaffed) and i thought she would write me up for it. i had men tell me about their jacobs ladder piercings and had them ask if i could size that jewelry which i quickly shot down. there was one guy who smelled so bad that wed have to febreeze the store after he left and it would still smell like death. there are so many more. people fighting on black friday, women telling me i had child bearing hips and i should have kids already. and the one time some lady came in to return a christmas gift for her daughter and i asked if her kid would like something else. her response? my daughter passed away on christmas. which was heartbreaking.

30729	214	blna2q	emqq9wa	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh man its my time to shine. i worked at hot topic for 4 years, so i have several. 1. this one happened when they first released their jean brand. they had sent us all sorts of signage for the promo sale and were holding a store contest among the districts for who could sell the most jeans for the month, i dont remember what the prize was but my manager was really determined to win so he made it so we all had to wear the jeans during our shift, ok fine not a problem, the catch was he picked them out and he always chose super skinny tight ones (all of us employees were underage girls, oldest being 18) and on top of that he made stickers and buttons for the promotion on his own dime, that said : ask me how to get into my pants! :| you can imagine how that turned out. 2. had a chick straight up take a shit in the dressing room. our store is one of the smallest, and theres never a point at which someone could be out of your sight and there was only one dressing room so i knew exactly who did it. i let her in to try on halloween costumes and noticed she didnt bring anything out with her, so as per protocol i went in to see if the merchandise was in there and i walked into a huge pile of shit smeared all over the merchandise and mirror/walls. it was fucking gross. my manager tried to make me clean it up. we couldnt even really do anything about it either. we asked her about it and she insisted she didnt do it. 3. a couple and their baby came in one day, it was a busy day, but i recognized the chick because she was a well known local stripper who would frequently come in an hour before closing and spend hundreds of dollars on random shit while she was strung out and then try to return it- clearly worn and used- a few days later. anyways this time, she was there with her boyfriend (im assuming) and they were walking around arguing and fighting about something. she ended up leaving and shortly after he followed. not too long after that the store is empty and i start hearing a baby. sure enough, these people left their infant in his car seat on the damn floor. we called the police obviously, but they returned not long after that for the baby.

30729	751	blna2q	emqkozw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	last summer in the evening three guys came in to harass me. im a female and i was working alone because we werent expected to make enough that day to justify having more than one person working. one of the three guys who came in stood back by our jewelry thing and claimed that someone from spencers had sent them there to ask for our advice for peeing on a girl during sex. at this point the other two were laughing their asses off. and i was immensely uncomfortable but because who knows what their intentions were i had to try to be polite because the last thing i needed was for them to call corporate and make a complaint. all the while there were two other guys up by the front counter who were looking at the new pop releases for the day who watched the entire thing go down and not say anything but expressed that the situation was messed up after those three left. the whole night i was paranoid to do my bank deposit because i wasnt sure of those three would still be in the mall and i called up an old coworker of mine to walk with me. honestly i dont have a problem when customers are genuinely looking for some weird shit, but that was straight up harassment.
30729	187	blna2q	emr2afj	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i actually have mostly good stories about the time i worked at ht. i took the position as an asm when i was between jobs and ended up staying almost three years. one thing i havent seen mentioned often in this thread is how many strippers shop at ht. its like a one stop shop for dancers. we sold body glitter, scented body spray, decent makeup in non traditional colors, crazy platforms and spike heels, a ton of lingerie at a relatively cheap price, accessories, body jewelry, cheap hair dye, and colored wigs/hair extensions. i absolutely could not tell you how many of my regulars were local dancers, maybe 50? lets just say whatever bank teller processed our cash deposits probably wondered why so many of the one and five dollar bills sparkled and smelled like cotton candy. the sm when i was hired was a woman, and she seemed to favor hiring other women, so most of my staff was girls. i did have a few male sales associates, and b was my favorite. he was a straight edge christian metalcore kid fresh out of high school and obsessed with girls. he was a good kid, and i would always try to schedule us together, because he was genuinely nice and great at customer service, he was a hard worker, and we would talk about girls, music, and video games while we worked. one day, these two dancers come in together, and lets just say they are on. most of the dancers who came in would be in sweats and sunglasses, carrying an iced coffee, like the exact opposite of what they were by night. super low key. not these two. they were dressed super provocatively, and when i approached to help them, they immediately made it apparent they were there to put on a little show and tease the guys at ht. girls flirt with you at ht, not constantly but waaaaay more than other traditional retail, but this was way beyond that. one of the girls asked the second if her ass was too fat to fit in the skinny jeans she had picked out, to which the second responded with some lewd remark about not wearing pants at all and slapping the first girl on the butt. they asked to get into the body jewelry case to see some pieces, which requires a key and supervision. as soon as they asked, i called for b, chucked him my keys, and told the girls, i have to go to my break, but b here will be more than happy to see to your every need, at which point i walked my ass out and sat down on the bench directly in front of our store to watch the show. i have never seen human flesh turn that shade of red in my entire life. b stood there talking to these girls with this look on his face that could only be described as panic mixed with terror doused in teenaged hormones. from my seat, i could tell the girls immediately picked up on it. they started stroking his arm while speaking to him. one of them held up some lingerie against her body and looked at him as if to ask him what he thought. i was having the time of my life. 15 minutes later, i decide to put b out of his misery and walk back in. the girls decide they have what they need and approach the register. b steps up to the register. the two of them start to do this bit where theyre fighting over who gets to pay for their purchase. each of them asks b to take their debit card. no, no, i insist! finally, b just snags the closest card and runs it. the loser of the game turns to the other girl, who just paid for their purchases, and says, well, i guess i have to thank you proper, and proceeds to shove her tongue in her friends mouth. now ive been around the block and seen some shit, but at this point even i was put back on my heels a bit. but b, his eyes were so wide he looked like a cartoon character and his mouth was wide fucking open. gathering myself, i was just about to gently ask the girls to kindly not in my family establishment when they stopped, turned to b, and blew him kisses with winks. they left and i fucking lost it. i couldnt stop laughing or grinning the rest of the night. poor b couldnt think straight the rest of the shift and just wandered around in a daze until we left for the night.
30729	270	blna2q	emqq8mx	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a hot topic employee, but i am sure one or two would have a story about me and my friends in high school. i was a sophomore in high school at the peak of the scene queen movement and my friends and i partook in it all. right around this time hot topic opened up in our small town and suddenly other people had access to band merch, skinny jeans, etc. i was wandering around the store shortly after it opened with my posse and in walk some cheerleaders from our high school (our town only had one high school) and my friend loudly screams, i guess theyll just let anyone in here!. yes because hot topic is the ultra exclusive store for tru fannzzzzz.
30729	62	blna2q	emr19on	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	tldr at the bottom, lmao this got way longer than i thought it would be. so theres a certain amount of dealing with creeps that i feel like most ppl go through as retail employees, but at my store we have a customer that we all know as the hot topic predator. my first interaction with the predator was very odd. he was obviously hitting on me, and i was obviously uncomfortable. he traps you there by asking you more and more personal questions and seeming very interested in your answers, so i almost felt guilty trying to pull away from the conversation. i felt like he was a nice guy, he just didnt understand boundaries, and i have a boyfriend anyways. so i survive an uncomfortable first interaction, but he kept on coming back. he was always alone, and he never bought anything. sometimes hed try to talk to me, but id just act like i was too busy with the job to chat. then he took another victim. i was helping out a really sweet girl while he was in the store, and he trapped her in the jewelry section asking really similar things that he asked me. she didnt seem uncomfortable by it, so i wasnt too worried. they talked for probably 15 mins before she left. and then literally five minutes later he starts hitting on another girl. at this point im like really grossed out, and after the second victim finally escaped i let her know he had just gotten another girls number, and she agreed with me that it was pretty douchey of him to try for two in one night. so here i am thinking this guy literally just comes in my store to find goth gfs and im like real mad about it lmao. come on dude, go find some other breeding grounds that arent you loitering around a store bothering employees and customers. but wait it gets even weirder. i got a text from a coworker saying there was a guy talking to a girl in the store for literally over an hour, and he managed to catch him name. it wasnt the name the predator had told me, so i figured it was just someone else oddly spending that much time in hot topic. then, i catch him talking to one of my female coworkers one day, and she tells me he had given her a different name too. she got really creeped out. she let me know that she had met up with him once to talk about his small business and he was basically interviewing her, asking quite personal questions and wouldnt tell her what the business was?????? so now weve gone from your average overly friendly dude, to please stop hitting on girls in my store, to this guy is definitely hiding something and i never want him stepping foot in my store again. and that was the last ive seen of the hot topic predator, but im sure hell come back, and you know damn well ill be kicking him out when he does. tldr: a customer went from annoying guy that hits on every girl in hot topic to this guys hiding something and im very worried by giving us all different names and interviewing a coworker of mine for his business, but wouldnt tell her what his business was.
30729	225	blna2q	emqneov	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	one i can actually answer! i worked there for a short time over christmas as a second job to earn extra cash. hours were shit though, maybe 15 hours a week split into 3 shifts. anyways, the first one was when i was helping someone grab something off the bottom shelf. an older man and his still too old to be shopping at hot topic son were cashing out after i finished helping them. super rude, music snobs who hates everything but the classic rock shirts we sold. as i was bent over grabbing something for an older woman, the older man walks by on his way out, points to my ass and says thats what i want for christmas! while him and his 40 years old son leave laughing. i almost cried. secondly was the insane amount of girls coming in for billie eilish stuff. this was before she was super big so i didnt know who they were talking about. i got some of the worst death glares from those 15 year olds i ever have working in retail.
30729	113	blna2q	emqs0kj	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes! my time to chime in! ill never forget this because it still disgusts me to this day. this chick (i went to high school with her) tried to return a tongue piercing. its against company policy not to accept piercings back if the package has been opened, for very obvious health reasons. i could tell straight from the get go that the packing had been opened and i flat out asked her have you worn these? she answered yes. and got immediately defensive when i wouldnt take them back. after calmly explaining the company policy multiple times, i finally said would you wanna wear a complete strangers used tongue piercing in your mouth?! she huffed and left and 7 years later i catch myself wondering about her one brain cell.

(like black friday, but its the day after christmas) and this lady is getting so upset that she cant get a better deal on some graphic tees (the deal was $15 tees instead of the usual deal which was buy 2 get 1 free) she wanted both deals, and the cashier was explaining to her how deals werent combinable. so my manager stepped in to try and explain it. she starts yelling and getting so angry. a customer behind her pipes up and said something along the lines of why are you being so difficult? im sure theyre (us staff) having a hard enough day, so just let it go. and that first customer did not want to hear that, and she turned around and decked the other woman. it turned into a full blown fist fight, and mall security had to be called.
30729	97	blna2q	emraq1b	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"fuck i finally have a perfect response and this post is 11 hours old!!! well if anyone is still here, in 2008 i was assistant manager at hot topic. the manager hired me because we had flirted at my old job and he asked me to come work at his store and i hated my current job at lime grill. so i said fuck it and went to go work for him. he would always hit on me at the store. i was 20 yes old. i didnt really entertain it but we were cool, plus he seemed to hit on every girl that would walk in there. on friday nights he'd hang around the store and the employees and i would joke about how he'd seem to be flirting with underage girls but we also didnt think much of it because that was his personality. he was short, covered in tats, and actually pretty cute so the little teenage emo girls would come in just to see the ""hot hot topic guy"". he'd entertain them like it was fun for him to have little fans. he was 34 yes old but could pass for a highschooler if it werent for the tats all over his arms and neck. fast forward 2 months into my job and he was arrested. at a hotel. with a 12 yr old girl that he met at the store. she apprently got scared, backed out, and called her mom to come get her. good job manny you fucking creepy fuck bag. aventura mall, aventure fl for reference. his name was manny if you wanna look up the new stories."

30729	48	blna2q	emr0zkr	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	someone once left a live chicken in our dressing room. how they got it in the mall itself remained a mystery for the entire time i worked there. we also had someone shove a piece of pizza between our folded shirts. but i also had a weird hold over the juggalo kids and would sell them that powdered sour sugar that come in tubes and have them snort lines of it for my amusement because i was a monster.
30729	48	blna2q	emr1izh	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i doubt i will see the story here but i was probably part of a horror story for an employee. though really it probably was just a minor annoyance. my mom took me into hot topic because i was an edgy teen. it was the only place that had clothes that made me feel good about myself (like i actually felt like i looked good in them, especially with a bobbed haircut). well for whatever reason my mom decided she didnt like me wearing dark clothes with the cute little skulls and silly characters on them. she proceeded to make fun of me and call me a dyke (which turned out to a nickname for me amongst her friends) really loudly in the store. i just kept ignoring her and saying, well idc i like them the whole time. finally the cashier apparently had enough and told my mom to please shut up, he didnt like hearing her talk to me like that. if she *really* didnt like being in the store to just please leave. my mom ended up having a fit about him talking to her like that, he is just a child, how dare he talk to her like that, what does he know about raising a child. it was so embarrassing and i had to leave without new clothes. it sticks with me cause that was the year of school where i ended up wearing huge hoodies to hide the clothes that barely fit cause my mom didnt want to accept me liking hot topic
30729	90	blna2q	emqx2kd	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes finally a question i'm an expert in answering!! i started as a seasonal employee and made my way up to assistant store manager. worked there for a little over 5 years, too! (would have been store manager but i decided to switch to something with holidays off, lol yay banking.iregreteverything.) anyway. * most customers were *really* awesome, even parents of kids just coming in for the holidays. but of course we had some strange birds, what retail store doesn't?! this is my fav story, and though horror, it is still wholesome ;) i had one customer who was looking for earrings for her son. i was showing her different kinds of earrings and smaller gauged plugs, explaining the process of stretching. in the middle of this, she calls her son over and asks him to show me his ears - *that he pops off his head and hands to me b/c they are prosthetic ears!!* inside i freaked the f*ck out b/c i wasn't expecting that, but i somehow managed to keep it together and ended up not only making the sale but also helping that little boy feel better about himself; he said that having a real earring would help make his ears look more real. at the end of the entire thing there was a tear in my eye. * had a customer who called and told me a story about how there was another worker there who, when she would bend over, he could see her thong and he said he made a joke to her about it but felt really bad and he wanted to apologize so if he could just have that girl call him so he could say he was sorry. told my store manager about that one before i talked to the person i thought he may have meant and turns out this weirdo was calling all the stores saying the same thing. * had a customer who wanted a couple of the women employees to try on shoes for him so he could pick something out for his wife. he was aroused. (but i mean hey he bought a couple pairs soooo win? idk.) * had a customer who would come in every sunday to give the entire working staff a hug. * had a customer who would come in every couple of weeks and ask if we had kermit the frog merchandise. (wow this list is getting long, lol. but man i used to love this job so much.)

""one time i was literally just folding shirts at the front of the store, the side that faces out toward the mall and and some white woman in her 40s just screamed and then i looked at her and she did the sign of the cross at me one time i had a juggalo, in full clown paint, pay me for a t shirt in quarters a brony got pissed at me because we didn't have some sort of rainbow dash key chain or some stupid shit like that a lady called the store to ask about hair dye. she wanted purple and we had a lot of different ones. so i told her we had royal purple, lavender etc. and she asked me to describe the colors in depth to her over the phone and she got pissed at me because she couldn't visual what it looked like and then asked me what it would look like if she put it in her brown hair without bleaching it and i told her it wouldn't turn out and she got even more mad"""
30729	42	blna2q	emqqobx	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i never worked there but a girl that worked at my local hot topic had real big colorful braids. and lots of piercings and make up. ive seen her have to throw multiple people out for trying to take pictures of her without her permission.
30729	195	blna2q	emqq95u	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"wow this question was made for me! i've worked in hot topic for 3 years! i'm 8 time employee of the month and really well liked by most customers at my location, so much so that i'll be eating in the food court and people will come up to me and ask if i'm the hot topic girl. anyways, one day i was working a shift with one of the assistant store managers. it was an incredibly slow day and we were just tidying up the store while chatting about our pets. since there wasn't much to do, my boss thought it was a perfect time for a break, so i had the floor to myself. our location is small and usually this is fun for me because i get to help all customers that come in. however right as he leaves, we have the nastiest, rudest two women come in. they charge right up to me and begin screaming at me in a chinese language, i'm unsure if it was mandarin or cantonese. note, i'm half japanese half white but people often think i'm just white. so cut back to the story, these two women are screaming at me. i calmly tell them i have no idea what they're trying to tell me as i only speak english and the tiniest bit of french. the one woman just starts shouting return as close to my face as possible. so i ask for her receipt. no receipt. if they don't have a receipt we have to ask if they have a points account so we can see previous purchases and make sure they did buy this shirt within the last 30 days. so i ask if they have a phone number or email with us. one is still screaming in her language at me and the other woman says i'm trying to steal her information. i explain that i just want to see when the shirt was purchased. the absolutely no english speaking woman pulled a different receipt from her purse and shoved it into my hands. the shirt in question wasn't even on the receipt and the receipt was from october, this happened in february. i explain this to them and say they have 30 days, not multiple months and the woman decides to say i don't know how the store works and she's done it before. i decide to at least take a look at the shirt she was trying to return. it was a pickle rick shirt that had no tag, not one but multiple stains on it and was oddly warm. i explained it needs to be unwashed, unworn and have the tags still on it to be able to be returned and the woman says ""yeah, no washed,"" as if i couldn't tell from all the stains. i tell them i won't be doing the return as if i had returned it i'd get some serious questioning from the store manager and the asm's. they leave and come back in about 10 minutes. right after the asm comes back from his break. they begin to scream at him in their language too. he is white, doesn't look remotely asian at all so at this point we were both kind of like, ""what the heck?"" i explain to him the situation and he agrees that we can't return the shirt. the woman then smacks me with the receipt she had and begins screaming in my face in her language. the other woman says we are too rude, and should be fired. i decide enough's enough and we'll call security. i'm waiting for them to pick up and my boss says, let's just do the return. then he retracts that idea once he sees the shirt. it was honestly gross. so he explains that the shirt needs to be unworn, unwashed and have the tags still on, the woman again says it wasn't washed. the other woman who spoke no english shoves my boss and screams more. my boss is the nicest person. like people are rude to him all the time and he still gives them service with a smile but will tell us his tale of woe afterwards. so he just kindly refuses to do their transaction. at this point i call security again but nobody was answering the phone. so we ask them to leave the store. they do, surprisingly. then, maybe 5 minutes later, they come back with a woman from michael hill, a fancy jewelry store who basically was trying to act as their translator with some obviously made up story that they were vacationing in canada and there was no way she could be bought the shirt in october because they had only been there a week. i asked how she had a receipt from our location from october and she ignored my question and just argued with the store manager over the return in question. after guilt tripping him and offering him a discount on rings if he ever needed one, she convinced him to do the return. at this point i walked away from the cash because we had other customers. as i was talking to one of our regulars, they were leaving. the one woman who didn't speak a word of english pushed me on her way out. had i not been at work, i seriously would've considered punching her. but this customer, who happens to think i'm one of the kindest and most helpful associates we have, gets fired up from this and begins telling them how rude it was and how they can't go around shoving people. the make the rude blah blah blah hand motion to him and smirk at me. nice customer feels badly for me and says he doesn't know how i deal with stuff like that. nice customer also tells customer service about what happened and that i'm great so if there's any complaints he wants to cancel them out. luckily there was no complaint but i'd be happy if i never saw those woman again."
30729	71	blna2q	emqqbhb	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i never worked there but in my youth hanging at the mall was like totally the thing to do and hot topic was in my price range for shopping. the time in question i was super hung over and aimlessly browsing while waiting for a friend at the pager store when some dude asked me if i wanted to see something cool. i hate being approached in public so i just said yes. he proceeded to whip out his ber-pierced cock. i nearly beer-shat my pants.
30729	2906	blna2q	empymbu	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my first job was at a hot topic in a dying mall. i was 16. one of the worst parts of the job was folding t-shirts. it seemed like every person who touched a t-shirt would ball it up and throw it somewhere out of place. i probably folded thousands of t-shirts. but whatever, just part of the job. i started there when they first began their rewards program. my manager was always on my ass trying to get me to sell this membership. nobody wanted a damn membership, or maybe i was a bad salesman, but either way, i rarely signed anyone up. this was reflected on the weekly report sent to the district manager, and i even got written up over it. i started working there because i loved music, and their album rack was always down my alley. they're a musically oriented company, so they had this sound system integrated with a central server that played a selection of maybe 10 songs, to be updated every month. well it didn't update for close to 3 months. every day i would hear the same songs 5 or 6 times over, for months, and it *drove me insane*. to this day i still get burnt out on music faster than anyone i know. during my breaks i would hang out in the run down, barely open mall and grab a bite at the auntie ann's. their pizza pretzel was my shit, and the cute cashier would hook me up with free marinara. we would flirt and chat all the time. i eventually got her number, i texted her (with my flip motorola) and we planned to hang out. i had my older friend buy me a four loco, when they still had caffeine, and i drove to her place at 10pm to pick her up. we shared the drink in the car on the way back to my house. we barely talked, unlike at the mall. very awkward. i took her to my sparsely furnished, unfinished basement and immediately we went at it. when we were done we kind of awkwardly sat there and i took her home just after midnight. from then on she would come into the hot topic to look for me and i would hide in the back while my manager covered for me. i totally ghosted her texts too. soon after i got fired for showing up hungover too many times, and i started to work at the pac sun right next door. that place is a whole other story.
30729	145	blna2q	emqqm3b	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	super late to this party, but i worked at ht for about 3 months. it was, and still is the worst job ive ever had. the management was just atrocious and the micromanaging was on a level i didnt know was even possible. so, i guess my horror story is just working there, with their pos system straight outa 1990. i purposely got fired by spending an entire open to close shift giving my employee discount to everyone that came in on a busy saturday though.
30729	36	blna2q	emqs43m	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	ah yes, my time to shine. a personal favorite of mine was a weeknight that i was working alone, seeing as we didnt get a lot of customers that late unless it was a friday or saturday. i had pretty much taken care of all the organizing and cleaning up that needed done on the floor, everything that had to go out the next day was out. so i was just strolling around the floor looking for stuff to fold and this lady comes in. she looked young but i honestly thought she was older than me (i was 19 at the time). she strikes up a conversation with me almost immediately and i rattle off my retail manager jargon, asking if i can help her find anything and letting her know the sales. after she looks around for a minute, she asks if we sell any nipple rings. we did have a few, so i told her yes and opened up the cabinet that held that particular style of body jewelry. the rule was that we had to stand with the customer and be near them when those cases were open so they didnt steal. as she looked, she asked me to get down with her and look give my opinions on what she was looking at. i felt a little awkward, and honestly i thought nipple rings were a little much, but i tried my best to be friendly and told her yeah, that ones cool. and let her know we had more on our clearance shelves. eventually, while she was looking, she decided to dive into the story of how she got it, and how she thought the size of her current piercing was different than it should be. i nodded along and said whatever oh, dang. or yeeeah. it whatever to make sure she didnt think i was ignoring her. then she asked me if i wanted to see it. oh, no thank you. i believe you no, no, really! [her current ring] looks bigger than it should be. thats weird, but no you dont have to show me. she accepts is and moves on to looking at hair dye. now, she asks me to join her in sitting on the floor and seeing what hair color she should get. i obliged her until more customers finally came in (thank god), but before that happened, she once again asked me if i wanted to see her nipple piercing. again, i declined. she acted like i was missing out on something. oh yeah, and i also had a pair of 40-yr. old moms come in and flirt with me at the register when they checked out. one asked if they could take me and get me a drink for being so helpful and i told her no, im too young. and she said no one needs to know!, so i told her i was a straightedge, she asked if that included sex, and mentioned her friend was interested before they left. what a store.
30729	77	blna2q	emqo5hw	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i know im late to the game and no one will see this but i worked at hot topic for a year, these are my experiences. white teenage girls yelling at the top of their lungs at there parents about something and dropping all of the curse words; we tell them to leave because familys are around and they look at you like wtf. teenagers coming in asking for razors to cut themself with and then laughing with their friends; no joke that happened twice. during the time, 2006, everyone buying misfits shirts and then look at you weird when you ask them their favorite song buy them; mine still is last caress. people stealing shit. fun fact, if youre a girl, put your stolen stuff in your purse because staff cant look in there. i have learned that people forget how to fold a shirt when they try to put a shirt back and just shut it into the shirt stack. working the christmas holidays suck because it takes over an hour or two to put everything in the store back when youre closing. lastly, this isnt bad but when i worked there, they had the biggest storage of mp3s i had seen at that time. millions of songs to choose from when working and that was pretty cool. nothing to crazy but that was my experience with working at hot topic.
30729	56	blna2q	emqv8n0	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"not hot topic, but i used to be a manager at pacsun which is very hot topic adjacent, usually the same clientele, in my case the stores were literally next to each other. this was in 2013 before kendall and kylie jenner were known for uh. what they ""do"" today. they had a fashion line that was sold through pacsun and were just instagram stars. well teenage girls fucking ate all their clothes up and every time there was a release they would line up outside of the store and go wild. one of the major and (pretty fucked up if you ask me) issues was the sizing. all of the sizing was extremely distorted from ""normal"". i know that womens clothing sizes often vary from brand to brand but this was just insane. what would normally do a size 4 was a 0 in their jean shorts. it was almost like it was designed to make teenage girls feel bad. needless to say we had a fuck ton of returns. also, there was one instance where kendall and kylie tweeted that they were in a pacsun doing a meet and great, they tagged the pacsun which was literally on the opposite side of the country but apparently no one read that because about 400 people called the store asking for them (i thought they were prank calls at first) and another 1000 showed up to mob us and left angry when they weren't there. so yeah, i fucking hate kendall and kylie."

18697	5604	btm0yy	eozw13s	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i've told this story before, but i had invited this guy over to my place for dinner after we'd been casually seeing each other for three weeks or so. things were going pretty well -- we were chatting, getting along like a house on fire, and he was helping me cook dinner -- when i started to feel *extremely* intestinally unwell. i've always been kind of a private pooper, and i could tell that this one wasn't going to be fun, so i asked him if he'd pop down to the shop at the end of the road to grab a bottle of wine for dinner. he agreed, and toddled off down the street, and as soon as he was gone i *raced* to the bathroom and relieved myself with something roughly akin to the force of a. well, imagine [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/), but in reverse. i took a minute to catch my breath, reached over to the toilet roll holder, and came back empty. *well, shit.* no matter. i had a full 9-pack of toilet paper in the back room -- i didn't have space to keep it in my tiny bathroom; it was a very small apartment, so i usually just grabbed a roll or two -- and he'd only just gone. i had plenty of time. cut to me, thirty seconds later, pants around my ankles and my shit-caked bunghole shimmying my way down the central hallway of my flat when i hear a still, small voice from behind me. &nbsp; ^^^'erm. ^^^*what* ^^^are ^^^you ^^^doing?' turns out he'd managed to get to the shop and back in record time, and was sitting on my couch in my living room with a perfect, *perfect* view of my little faecal burlesque. i was framed in the doorway like a goddamn renaissance painting. it was as though i was presenting myself to him in the worst possible *you like?* come-on in the history of dating. it's very difficult to have a civilised dinner after that.

18697	2493	btm0yy	eozzmue	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	new year's eve 1999 i called a woman i was very good friends with (friends only, i was firmly in the friend zone at that time), she was also my boss. i had way too much to drink and was not in any way considered sober or even slightly so, i was pissed as a fart. i proceeded to tell this woman how i felt about her, what i wished to do with her and how i wanted to do it. i told her this for about 45 minutes. afterwards i continued to drink. several days later back at work she calls me into the office and asked me why i'd called her at new year, i pulled a blank, i honestly could not remember a thing. she also informed me that several minutes into the conversation/monologue she handed the phone over to her mother. i still pulled a blank, in fact i was so convinced that nothing happened i was sure she was winding me up. if anything like that had happened after all why was she still even talking to me let alone letting me continue to work with her. she insisted that i called and i refused to believe her. it was not until late january when i received my detailed mobile phone bill that showed a 48 minute phone call to her number late on december 31 that i finally had to believe her. the difficult part was facing her mother after my boss and i became an item. we are now very happily married but even now my mil still takes the piss out of me over that phone call. my wife however is very happy. edit- when this message was posted it was the 69th post on this thread - coincidence?

18697	4392	btm0yy	eozqnf7	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"a female friend of mine  to whom i was admittedly attracted  had been expressing her reservations about an upcoming vacation with her family. though it wasn't being overtly presented as such, the trip was meant as a way of re-solidifying her parents' marriage, which had been a touch rocky at the time. they would all be driving from san francisco to redding (which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere in northern california), where they'd stay at a bed-and-breakfast inn for a weekend before continuing northward for some unknown destination. in keeping with the alleged purpose of this so-called vacation, two rooms had been booked at the inn in question. to her dismay, though, my friend discovered that her mother would be occupying one room, her father would have the other, and that she and her sister would each have to bunk with one of their parents. this was worthy of lament on its own, but it was made unforgivably worse by the verbal diarrhea that i offered in an attempt at providing comfort: ""aw, it won't be so bad!"" i told my friend. ""your father will probably enjoy sleeping with you."" a moment passed before i realized what i had said. then, with a feeling of growing horror, i tried to explain myself. ""wait, i didn't mean it like that!"" i hurriedly said. ""i mean, like, he's probably sick of sleeping with your mom. no, wait, i mean. i just mean that he wants to spend some quality time with his daughter."" if i had stopped there, i *might* have been able to salvage the situation. but as it happened, i decided that the best course of action would be to keep talking. ""i can't say that i blame him, really. *i'd* love to sleep with you."" she and i don't talk much these days. **tl;dr: implied incest, mocked mom, failed flirtation.**"

18697	434	btm0yy	ep09kgv	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	so about three years ago, my dad, my dad's girlfriend, my brother and i went cycling around this lake like we do so often. my brother (15 at that time) and i (11 back then) decided to make a race with the finish being a parking lot. at the end of this parking lot was a barrier right before a bridge. it rained that day in the morning and obviously, my brother won by far but i was still going at - what for my age was - a high speed. when i finally got to the finish, i had to slow down, but my bike just wouldn't. that's when i knew i fucked up real bad. i ended up crashing into that barrier and hanging over that shit afterwards. my brother describes this story as so unbelievably funny because my bike was just small enough to fit under the barrier and so it drove on like 10ft, leaving me behind hanging on the barrier. well i hope i made your day a bit better. also, my english isn't perfect, i know. i'm not a native speaker.

18697	757	btm0yy	ep0f56x	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	more years ago than i can quite believe (until i catch a glimpse of my grey hair in the mirror) was the last time i drove drunk. it was a summer lunchtime and a handful of us had been partying for several days at a friends (parents) house. i was *wasted*, as was everyone else - so when a female friend turned up in her brand new 4x4 and promptly fell asleep the obvious course of action was for us to borrow the vehicle for a joyride around the lanes of somerset. this was, actually, pretty anomalous for us - drink-driving was always heavily frowned upon - but clearly under the influence of anything and everything it all seemed to make perfect sense. for the next while - i was far too pissed to know how much time was passing - we took turns speeding round the roads in what was effectively a stolen car, drinking and getting (even more) high. my turn came last and everyone was joking about our good fortune running out and us getting nicked/dying in a fiery crash (ha. ha. ha.) - especially with me behind the wheel, as we were quite close to the spot where id been a passenger in a crash the previous year. which was thoroughly reassuring. i settled in and started tearing up the lanes - cant remember what the vehicle was but it was great fun to hoon round in (and a bit different: automatics arent especially common in the uk) - and put on the prodigy for the ideal soundtrack. turning the corner i saw that we were at the start of a long straight (an old roman road leading to glastonbury) ideal for just flooring it - so thats what i did. at the end of the straight i made the turn with, i think, two wheels ever-so-slightly leaving the ground - and ill never forget the definitely discernible shift of mood that caused in all of us, like yeah ok that was a little close. its time to stop this. - just before i saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and my whole world got ready to go down the shitter. i had no idea how long theyd been behind us but even if it was very recent thing they would just have seen us taking the last corner on two wheels. at god knows how much over the speed limit. in a stolen car. very drunk. very high. with no licence, nor insurance. and pockets full of drugs. until then id always thought my blood turned to ice was nonsense but at that instant i understood: i really felt frozen. the car went immediately silent (apart from the siren which we could now hear) as i killed the stereo, trying not to panic, just thinking over and over: im fucked. this is it. im really, truly, totally fucked - and everyone else in the car thinking: hes fucked. totally fucked. thank god its not me. there was nowhere to pull in for what felt like miles so i had plenty of time to dwell on my imminent destruction, and to weigh up the pros and cons of trying to escape them (which wouldnt have happened anyway in that car). outwardly i was totally dispassionate and calm (to the extent that later one of my friends said hed decided i was either a psychopath or a terminator) but internally i was screaming, sobbing and already trying to guess how many years inside i was looking at. finally i saw a place to pull in, and put my indicator on like pulling back the hammer on my suicide. i took a deep breath, made the turn - and the police car just steered wide and sped past us. the lights were to get us to pull over, sure - but only to get out of the way. theyd received a different call. ive never driven drunk again.
18697	290	btm0yy	ep1t45t	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"ive posted this in on reddit before, figured i'd put it here because its one of my favorite stories and it fits. so, my junior year of high school, i was taking a class called ""sci-fi and fantasy"". predictably we read books of said genre. we did readers theater (each person in the class gets assigned a character on a voluntary basis, anytime the character says something, the assigned person would say it aloud, the teacher was the narrator, and roleplay was involved if you choose to) on a couple books, one being ""the hobbit"" by jrr tolkien. so in this chapter of the book, my character, thorin, had maybe one or two lines so i was bored. this was the chapter where the eagles swoop down and save the day from the orcs. as the group was saying goodbye (i forget how the book actually goes in this part to the specifics, please forgive me) to the eagles, my teacher stops and asks the group, ""anyone wanna like to do the eagle part?"" gazes around the entire class and does a double take at me (i'm a fairly outgoing person, especially in that class with roleplaying) so i'm like ""f*ck it. why not right??"" and out of the silence, with zero warning to anyone, i just scream ""cccaaaaaaaaaawwwwwww!"" and did the best eagle screech i could do (it was pretty spectacular, especially for being very much on a whim). everyone stops and looks at each other. now its dead silent. nobody knows what to do, or how to react. so my teacher, pipes up after 5 seconds of pure silence ""ok. does anyone wanna do the actual eagle part?"" apparently they had actual lines where they say things."

"the year is 2015. a variety of mishaps affected my well-being that year, but this one was entirely my fault. the moment of realisation was pretty strong so it popped into my head on reading this thread. it's june. it's my birthday. because of the messy year i had had, my annual bbq featured more guests than usual. friends coming over in support, i suppose. my bbq had been sitting in the garden for most of the winter, but i didn't think much of it. i gave it a clean and fired it up - there was plenty of gas in the canister, so i proceeded to cook enough meat to feed a small village. this went fairly well, and i was down to the last few sausages when i felt a warm sensation around my shins. ""hey the-go-kid, what's happening there!?"" screamed my friend's wife. a moment or two later i realised what was happening. there was a 3-foot flame protruding from the gas canister. like a mini-flamethrower. the rubber seal had corroded from the time it had spent not being particularly well stored in the winter, and with the canister being heavily used, it had decided to go full ellen ripley on me. there were around 20-25 adults and 10 kids in the very small garden at this point, so i figured, i need to evacuate. we managed to get everyone out of the way, and i ran upstairs to get my tiny fire extinguisher. i exhausted this thing on the canister, but it was so hot the flames flared up again. fortunately for me, my garden backed onto the fire brigade's premises, and within 2-3 minutes, the professionals were there and spraying all my food in foam. they were happy to take the canister away, saying it needed to be cooled for an hour or two and they would do so while drinking a cup of tea. it was all fairly funny in hindsight, [but it was soon overshadowed by what happened a few months later.](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9f5zu8/tifu_by_moving_in_next_door_to_a_drug_dealer/)"

"worked at a dubbing studio. took a pic of an voltron episode. turns out it was unreleased worldwide and they caught me. when i got into work and someone says ""you got a reddit account?"" my heart sank. i didn't leak or spoil anything but it was a big deal and could've lost a major player in the dubbing area (dreamworks). i still get anxiety when i think about it"
18697	52	btm0yy	ep0939p	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"reaching for the cutoff valve on part of the pump system at the swimming pool where i was a summer lifeguard just as it made a ""pipes aren't supposed to make that kind of a sound"" sound. then it blew up in my face. the next explosion is probably the one that shattered my right leg though it *could* have been the one after that. i was already crawling out of the room when the fourth pipe burst. having turned the system off about ten minutes earlier because of the hot water on the ground (unheated system) owing to the *melted* hole in one of the pvc pipes, i never should have fucking gone back to cut off the water no matter what my employer's help line said."

18697	41	btm0yy	ep0i9nk	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	when i was 7 my parents left me and my sister ( who was 10 at the time ) home with a baby sitter who lived 3 houses down. it was in the morning and my sister had just woken up and wanted cereal but i had the last bit of milk . her being the petty person she is , decides to eat the cereal dry causing me to feel bad so i went into the kitchen and put coco powder in a plastic cup ( no liquid mixed with the powder ) then i placed the cup in the microwave for 15 mins in hope of melting the coco powder so my sister could put it on top of her cereal . as if on queue my baby sitter left to go grab something for her house and she left my sister in charge . fast forward 5-7 mins and the whole kitchen was full of smoke , **the cup was on fire and the fire alarm was blazing the roof off and i was crying niagara falls. i knew i had fucked up big time** . my sister attempts to solve the situation by telling me to fan the fire alarm with a cloth as she opens the windows and dashes water into the microwave ( note that the fire was small but was big enough for water to not be able to distinguish it ). enter baby sister who's now dumbfounded to how i was able to set the microwave on fire during her 6 minute absence , who now calls the fire brigade and my parents to alert them of the fire. lets just say my parents didn't take it so well but on the plus side a firefighter correctly melted some of the coco powder for my sister ( before my parents arrived ) all whilst dying of laughter .
18697	46	btm0yy	ep13nnn	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i clogged the toilet at my boyfriend's house. i was dog sick with a stomach bug and he was at work. the plunger was no help at all and there was no way a plumber could get there before he got home. i was in an absolute panic. there was no way in hell i was letting him see what i did in that toilet. it was the stuff of nightmares. i would have to move and change my name out of embarrassment had he born witness to what my body produced in that bathroom. i had no choice but to to unclog it manually. it was not pretty. i will never speak aloud of the things i did that day to keep my boyfriend from seeing my poop.

"when my dad (who lived states away and wasn't my emergency contact) was still there after i calmed down during a severe manic episode. i thought i was dying or dreaming. i was found naked outside speaking gibberish by the police and brought to the hospital. by time i calmed down, i was forced to stay there for at least a week and was shamed by my dad ( who obviously wasn't part of my hallucination) for ""being like my mom"" by ""taking drugs"" and ""ending up in a psych ward."" i used to smoke pot here and there but that's not where i fucked up. i fucked up by not taking my therapist's advice soon enough and getting a proper evaluation from a psychiatrist since mental disorders run in my family."
