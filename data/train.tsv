[CLS]	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	[SEP]	that we love and care about them, i think we often get caught up in day-to-day life and forget to tell them this.	[SEP]	8336
[CLS]	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	[SEP]	1. your emotions wont be this intense forever. but they are real and valid. my parents always invalidated my feelings  too dramatic, its just your hormones, youll grow out of it, you dont know how good you have it  while on some base level they possibly were right, it didnt mean my feelings werent real and intense in that moment. allow yourself to feel what you feel. but dont wallow or feed the depression kitty. it does get better. 2. if social media makes you feel shitty, just stop. it makes everyone feel shitty  even the people whose lives seem so much better and glamorous than yours. chances are, theyre posting that stuff to not feel shitty too. remember, everyone is posting their greatest hits. remember, everybody poops  even the girl posting glam pics from greece, she probably pooped right before or after the pic. point is, dont get wrapped up in that. take a month or two break from social media and see how you feel. 3. you dont have to go to college. and you also dont have to not go if you dont know what to do with your life. youll figure it out, maybe get inspired by your classes. and, as long as it will not launch you into a huge debt, it is ok to major in something you might not end up getting a career in. (to an extent). college is more than career training. its a much bigger learning experience about. everything! people, the world, yourself. dont dig a debt, work very hard, have lots of fun, and try to keep your eyes on a career path, but also absorb everything like a sponge. 4. i hated when people told me, you wont even miss high school when youre older. i did, for a little bit. and now, i really dont. as important as it is as a state of your pre-adulthood, in the big scheme of things, its just a tiny chapter. so dont get hung up on the mistakes you made or the drama you had. appreciate the experience for what it gave you, and move on. 5. lastly, and where i go all old lady, please put your phone away in the car. even at stoplights. just wait until you arrive. you may be super used to it, but it only takes one second of inattention to become potentially fatal. someone just died in my neighborhood for this very reason. sending a snap. it can wait. 6. (edit to add #6) teach yourself personal finance basics. your school and maybe parents probably neglected this, if times havent changed all that much. but. the internet is wonderful! you can teach yourself. take an edx or kahn or itunesu course. learn the basics and start saving. really truly understand student loans before taking them. and save. saving sounds like something you have plenty of time for later. when you make more money. but tomorrow never comes. learn and save now.

[CLS]	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	[SEP]	a lot of people try to glamorize high school and make you think your high school years are the best years of your life. for a lot of people, this just isn't true. it's okay not to like high school or to feel like you don't belong. you are not alone. it gets better. high schoolers deal with a lot of heavy shit. a lot of mental illness comes to light at this age, including depression and anxiety but also heavier stuff. many who struggle with these issues won't get help until years later. high school kids also deal with a lot of issues, like identity issues, bullying, pressure to conform, disputes with parents, the pressure associated with juggling work, school and life that often get better once high school is done. hang in there, it does get better.

[CLS]	parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	[SEP]	build good health habits now. if you're not already active, find a simple active hobby you can do. take up pokemon go or take up bike riding or something. also, learn how to cook some basic and healthy meals like chicken pesto pasta or fried rice. the healthier you are as a teen the easier it is to stay healthy as an adult. edit: my food options seem super controversial, like portion control and different recipes aren't a thing. but here's a recipe that's super simple, fairly healthy, takes about 5-10 minutes and anyone can do. buy some bagged lettuce, or like 2-3 different kinds of lettuce if you can get the fresh stuff. take a cucumber grab some olives or carrots or whatever else you like. snag some feta cheese. fry up a small amount of minced turkey (i get that everyone hates fried food, but again, proportions are key). put lettuce in bowl, slice up as much cucumber as you want, add that to bowl, cut up carrots, add to bowl, same with olives and extra veggies. put in the small amount of turkey (like 100g is enough) and crumble a small amount of feta on top (feta has a strong flavor so you always need less than you think you do). it makes a really delicious salad that fills you up for hours. turkey is also naturally flavorful when fried like that so you can add spices or not and it's still fine.

[SEP]	as a mom, and a former teen, sometimes life just sucks, and it feels like it will never get better, but often times the suckiness is temporary. it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but maybe there is a bend in the path that is keeping the light from you. keep going till you get some agency and can make your own decisions and choices for what your life looks like. when i was 14 i really wanted to die. i was bullied and i felt unimportant in my family. i was ready to commit suicide, but i somehow talked myself into waiting until i was an adult. thank goodness i waited, life has been 1000% better and different from how i expected. i still occasionally get twinges of depression, but i get through in increments of 15 minutes at a time. you have value. you are worthy. you are loved.

[SEP]	disclaimer: not a parent. * don't smoke cigarettes. holy shit, i started at 15 and couldn't come to a full stop until i was 24. it might take some stress off or seem like a really easy way to socialize with people, but it's just a crutch. * use moderation in everything; don't get mixed up in addictive substances. there is absolutely such a thing as a psychological addition to substances that aren't physically addictive. just because weed won't kill you and doesn't create physical addiction, doesn't mean you can't become psychologically addicted to it. what do you think is the hardest part about quitting cigarettes? from my experience, most addicts will tell you that it's the routine. same thing applies to pot. if you're going to smoke pot, use moderation. is what you're considering taking physically addictive? pull your shit together and don't get involved in it. * fuck who you want (you know, with mutual consent and all), but use condoms. use condoms. use condoms you daft shit. * she/you is/are on birth control? congrats, use a condom. 100% of post-nut clarity will tell you that you're not at a time in your life to even risk having kids. * he/she's totally clean? definitely use a condom. guess what? they tell everyone they're clean, which means they're not using condoms with other people and probably have no fucking idea whether they're actually clean. the only exception to this should be long-term relationships after extremely careful consideration by both you and your partner. still, ymmv. be warned. * also, condoms don't fully protect against herpes. * actually pay attention in class. i spent so much time dicking around and looking for ways to burn time before the bell; i missed out on so much as a result. i'll never give a fuck about the memes i was browsing in my dc calculus class, but i definitely gave a fuck when i was in college level calculus classes and didn't remember the subject foundations that i should have established earlier on. additionally, paying attention is just a good habit. you might not give a fuck about the subject, but high school is most important in teaching you *how* to learn complex(ish) topics. it's a skill that you'll need no matter where you go in life. * don't make life decisions based on your high school paramore. for fucks sake, neither of your brains have fully developed. neither of you have any idea how the other will turn out in two, five, or ten years. i went from being some burnout stoner in the bottom third of my high school class to a law student who graduated with honors and an academic publication. some of the smartest people i knew fell off the deep end and never left their parents' houses, despite having every opportunity in the world to do so. * learn how to cut out the toxic people in your life. it might take time and patience, and a little finesse, but it's a thing i wish i'd learned to do before my early-mid twenties. you'll be a hundred times happier for it. * if you go to college, major in something marketable. minor in whatever the fuck you enjoy. don't flush 100k down the drain for an art history degree. * on that note, if you're planning on going to college, start applying for scholarships early. even if you're extremely fortunate and your family is covering your tuition, start applying for scholarships. student loans may seem like some distant problem, but you'll curse the ever loving fuck out of your past (current) self if you don't start taking some steps to mitigate needing loans. * if your family is covering your tuition through a 529 plan, whatever is leftover goes to you at the end of college. build a huge cushion with scholarships and be ahead of the curve in savings when you graduate. * finally, you're about to learn that time flies. you think you know now? it gets worse. it feels like last month that i left home to start college. that was seven years ago. enjoy every day. enjoy living with your parents and having stupid rules to follow. enjoy riding your crappy bike and working at that crappy pizza joint. enjoy that boring day with your friends where you're all sitting around with no idea what to do. one day, that's all going to go away. it's all going to be a memory as you shuffle through the increasingly complex and challenging world of adulthood. make no mistake, it's still exciting and you'll have more memories to make, but the ones you make today? make them fond.

[CLS]	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	[SEP]	as someone with bipolar, i always compare it to diabetes. it's a lifelong condition, usually managed by medication though occasionally people manage without. the medication isn't always perfect, so you have to let those around you know the warning signs. if you ignore / stop taking your meds suddenly, you will have serious problems and may embarrass yourself in public. sadly, i've recently had to add an extra section to my explanation as part of an apology. if you're a diabetic in hospital waiting for your foot to be amputated, even if you took your meds perfectly, you get limited sympathy if you spent every weekend stuffing yourself with cake. for bipolar, the equivalent tends to be booze / drugs, and god damn is the level of substance abuse high amongst us.

[SEP]	it hurts to know that you can't trust anyone. you nevet know when someone is going to sell your secrets and tell everyone about that one thing you did when you were extremely ill just for some karma. you hear stories of crazy people doing weird things and know that some day you might be the crazy person people talk about for morbidness. and to get better you always need to trust nurses and doctors, and yourself. and that's hard to do when you're seen as an anecdote and not as a person.

[SEP]	intrusive thoughts are exactly that. intrusive. the amount of times people have told me to just shrug it off or not think about it is annoying. edit: i've been asked for an example so i'll share my personal experience. what a lot of people seem to misunderstand is that most of the time they aren't traditional thoughts. they are commands your brain tries to issue and you have to mentally block them and stop them from occuring. having to constantly stop yourself from hacking someone with a cleaver or shoving a glass in someone's face really messes with your day. sometimes you just can't function properly and it really messes with your head to constantly deal with that kind of stress on top of living a normal life. edit 2: for people asking how i cope. first of all knowledge about the condition is the best thing you can acquire to combat it. once you know why things are happening you can deal with them. on top of that i have a meditative coping strategy for when it gets paticularly bad in inconvenient situations. i know it sounds silly but i'll take 10 seconds or so, imagine a wall with an iron bolted door in my head and forcefully lock that 'version' of myself in there. then i'll squash it, like the trash compactor from star wars . coupled with this i have a great doctor and some medication which really helps keep it under control. the final thing is more of a lifestyle change. i keep a strict exercise schedule and weekday routine which is more important to me than a lot of things in my life. it reminds me that i'm in control and my discipline won't falter. hope this helps someone!

[SEP]	"talk about it. suicide is the second most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, so they are a big clientele to reach. but also middle-aged people are at high risk, especially men. you can share articles that talk positively about mental illness and recovery, along with being active in foundations for suicide prevention like the [afsp in the us](https://afsp.org/take-action/), the [nspa in uk](https://www.nspa.org.uk/) or whichever it is in your country. most importantly, if you know someone who is feeling down or has suicidal thoughts, the best thing you can do to help is listen and ask directly ""do you have suicidal thoughts?"". this leaves them with a simple yes or no question, so they aren't the one who have to ""say it out loud"". don't panic when someone says ""yes""! you can have suicidal thoughts without wanting to actively take your life,; they are a coping mechanism for underlying issues. if you think you can handle it, ask how persistent they are, if they can distance themselves from those thoughts or if they have a plan on how to take their life. make sure to use the word ""suicide"" or any phrases without a negative connotation (see: ""killing yourself""). **don't** give advice: just actively listen and comfort them in a way that doesn't make them feel trivialized or judged. staying away from any moral judgements (regarding their feelings) is very important! also, you can offer to support them when they plan to get treatment, like accompanying them when going to the doctor, figuring out who to call and so on. there are also some chat or mail-based counceling options if speaking in person or on the phone is too much for them. edit: clarified some points, different wording"	[SEP]	782

[SEP]	i would like to say how wonderful my patients have been. most people are just looking for help and support on their way to recovery, like you would do with any physical illness. i mainly work with schizophrenia patients, and i am lucky to have met a whole variety of people from different backgrounds, with different interests and hobbies, who go about their lives like everyone else, just with a few more difficulties along the way! stigma is still real, despite the 'awareness' campaigns. i suppose it's best to remember that people with every type of mental health 'disorder' live by your side, they may be your neighbour, your teacher, your employee, your friend. don't isolate these people from society, help them by creating opportunities for them to join in! if you are in the uk at the moment there has been a good series of mental health documentaries that you can watch on iplayer. including 'psychosis and me', 'anxiety and me', and 'depression and me'. as well as the latest from louis theroux, i highly recommend you check them out.

[SEP]	we literally have no control over what our mind is doing, feeling, or how its going to react to anything. there is zero control. be understanding that this is much harder for the sufferer than it is for you. your brain is an organ and like any other organ it can get sick or weakened or simply not work as strongly or efficiently as it used to. you wouldnt expect someone to just get over or snap out of a heart attack or kidney failure. its unfair to expect the same of mental illness. edit because this got a lot more popular than i ever expected. while most people are agreeing with me, some seem to think im being damaging in what i say so ill make it clear. what goes on in our mind we cannot control. the thoughts, compulsions, panics that just appear we cannot preempt or stop. we *all* can, however, work hard to recover. we can seek help, get medicine, use coping mechanisms that will help us control how we act and react. but nobody can ever convince me we can just stop thinking the things that pop into our brains.

[SEP]	i know this isn't exactly what your asking for, but as someone who works in mental health, has suffered from mental health issues and has witnessed some of the effects. get. off. social. media. reddit isn't too bad because it isn't tied to your personality and identity. but get off instagram, facebook, snapchat and any other media that is linked to your real identity and self worth. those platforms are directly responsible for more harm to young people's mental health than everything else combined. i know of multiple suicides, attempted suicides and self harm cases that are a result of interaction on social media. i work in the nhs and we can't keep up with all the depressed teenagers that come in with depression and anxiety brought on by social media use. this in turn is stopping us from treating serious cases of mental illness. every single young person who has deleted their social media accounts on professional advice (in my service) has immediately felt a significant improvement in their mental health, their self worth and a reduction in their anxiety. please, if you do nothing else this year. delete your social media apps, wait for the withdrawal to wear off and feel the freedom that comes with not feeling like your whole life is on show and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone. edit 1: under no circumstances should you feel like you are taking up a professionals time. i know i said we're overloaded, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help. definitely seek help if you feel like you aren't coping. edit 2: if you have a healthy relationship with social media then that's great, but if logging into instagram has you feeling fat, worthless, boring, ugly, poor, stupid, or any other negative feeling. delete it. cheers for the silver. well shit. gold too. thanks a bunch.

[CLS]	as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	[SEP]	i was diagnosed with bipolar-ii disorder and depression about two years ago, which to me, was a relief. until that point, people close to me would sometimes point out that i seemed to be out of it. i'd be extremely emotional, unable to focus, and paranoid (to a lesser degree than the other two, but still). over time, i had become desensitized to these things and they became my new normal. after starting medication, then forgetting to take it, followed by a short involuntary commitment to the local hospital, and then constant and proper use of my medication, it hit me. before seeking treatment, i just didn't know anything was wrong. my point is we often don't know something is going on until others point the signs out to us. i sure as hell didn't. nowadays, i'm doing much better! the depression is under control and the bipolar-ii stuff is mostly controlled. i do have manic episodes once in a while, but it's usually just me starting to write about stuff and becoming bored. the depressive episodes don't happen anymore. yay! i'm starting my senior year at the local university in august, so everything is looking good from here. maybe i'll meet someone and end up with a girlfriend. who knows? so yeah, look out for the people you are close to. you might be the first one to pick up on something.

[SEP]	those struggling are often experts at hiding it. just like how it's extremely hard to spot someone drowning in a crowded pool, it's almost impossible to know who of your friends, family and peers is struggling with their mental health if they don't tell you. i can guarantee you that you personally know at least one person struggling with their mental health. if you don't know who it is, they are trying so hard to hide their issues because they are scared of how you (or others) will react. you might have spoken to them about their very issues (maybe even in a negative way) and never knew you were directly addressing them. mental health isn't padded rooms and strait jackets, it's real people with real issues. there should be no stigma or shame for being a human being.

[SEP]	with bipolar there are times that i need to be completely left alone to allow me to stay in my mindset, and their times where i need people to intercede and grab my hands or head to kick me out of whatever mindset that i have been locked into. unfortunately i may not show any outer signs which i'm in and both ways i have very little control. hopefully (like i have done) a bipolar person will train themselves to have a trigger which it allows you to ask the question of which problem they're having. for me if you hand me a coke or any liquid it pulls me out of my mind long enough that you can determine or you couldn't ask which part of the bipolar i mean positive or negative.

[SEP]	mental illness is a sickness, just like how there are other forms of sicknesses, mental health is a sickness of the brain. we can't control what are mental illnesses do or don't do. we just do the best we can and hope for the best. and i will say this again, we cannot control our mental illnesses. that would be like telling someone to control the flu they have or the chicken pox(not the best examples, but the best i got got at 2 in the morning). trust us, if we could control it, we would. and for others who suffer from mental illness, you shouldn't be ashamed about it. it takes a lot of courage and willpower to have to go through the constant stuggle and still maintain a life. as someone who has mental illness(anxiety, ocd, and depression), i just want to say, we can't control it, and it is imaginary or make belief or something we are faking. it's real, it's real illnesses, and we cant just make it go away. and for any people with mental illness that has read my comment, and people just in general, i'll say exactly what i got tattooed on my arm: your story isn't over yet; i hope this will help others gain some insight into mental illness. i have examples for some, but right now i am too tired to type them out so if someone wants to hear them, let me know. and to everyone suffering, i want to say, keep fighting. better days will come your way, i know it :)	[SEP]	14

[SEP]	im an anesthesiologist assistant. propofol is the standard drug of choice to knock patients out for surgery. there is a short window of time after the propofol hits where people are still lucid enough to talk, maybe 20 seconds tops. as i started to push a full syringe of propofol into his iv, one of my patients asked me if i wanted to hear him sing his alma maters war hymnhis way of giving me a hard time because i went to a rival college. i couldnt refuse. it sounded like this: good luck to dear old aggies/ they are the boyyyyys thatttttt-narrrr.hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.nnn. .at which point his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he stopped breathing. got to commend his fighting spirit, though. edit: yes, a big dose of propofol makes you stop breathing. if nothing is done about it, you probably never breathe again (think michael jackson). anesthesia providers are trained to breathe for you; either temporarily via a mask, or via a breathing tube and ventilator. in this case i intubated him and put him on the vent. all standard procedure and he did great. edit 2: changed it to war hymn even though i swear he called it the battle hymn.also, hook em!

[SEP]	"my story is actually about a funny/scary conversation between the surgeon and the anesthesiologists when i was going under. i'm a japanese-speaking american living in japan, and had talked extensively with my surgeon before the operation, but not with the anesthesiologists (another doctor took all the necessary info for them). so they came into the room speaking broken english at me while the surgeon spouted on in japanese. as they started to put me down, i turned over to the very cute lead anesthesiologist, told her a bunch of pervy shit i can barely remember in japanese, then she got all flustered and said to the doctor in japanese, ""why didn't you tell us he knew japanese! we studied for this!"" i laughed until i passed out, then woke up to a world of pain with no pain meds available other than ibuprofen up the butt."

[SEP]	we're pretty good at stopping tourist from doing too much damage. after being in the industry for a while you get a spidey sense for when people are going to do dumb things and can often steer them away from doing anything too bad. that being said, here's one of my favourite stories to tell. i was 7 months pregnant and it was the week before i went on maternity leave. i was driving out to one of our sites and to get there i had to drive (on the road of course) through our penguin colony. this particular species of penguin burrows underground and stays hidden in their burrow during the day, and comes out at night when birds of prey and other potential predators have gone to sleep. as i'm driving out to the site i realise the parking lot up ahead is full and people have started parking up and down the road. and that's when i see a giant suv pull off the road, drive between the bollards and into the penguin colony. i pull over as what seems like 20 non-english speaking tourists start to pile out of the vehicle and take selfies with the ocean backdrop. staying as calm as possible and using sign language i point out the no entry signs of the bollards they drove past, the burrows they have just collapsed, inform them they may have killed penguins, and to get their fucking vehicle out of the fucking colony. once i got them out of there i started digging out the collapsed burrows to check for penguins. the first four were luckily empty but the last one had a breeding pair. i get the girl out, check her over for injuries, and having no where else to put her i follow protocol and tuck her under my left arm against my side. i get the boy out and put him in the same position on the right side and start to check him over. remember how i said i was pregnant? well normally, you hold a penguin down low almost on your hip, but because of my round tummy i was holding him more at the bottom of my ribcage. so when i turned my head to start my health check, the bastard reached up and grabbed my top lip with his beak and ripped straight through the middle. it was about this time that the tourists walking along the road realised this ranger was holding onto two penguins. i had five or six tourists sprint through the colony towards me and start snapping pictures. while at the same time potentially collapsing more burrows. if any internet sleuths stumble across a picture of a heavily pregnant, pissed off looking ranger, holding two penguins with blood pouring down her face let me know. i've been waiting for that picture to show up for 3 years and haven't found it yet. happy ending, i chased away the photographers, popped the two uninjured penguins in a nearby unoccupied burrow, and radioed for back up to help with the parking situation. my lip healed without a scar, and both penguins left the following morning for a well deserved day in the ocean. tl;dr signage is there for a reason. rules are there for a reason. if you don't know what the reason is, doesn't mean you should break the rules. edits: real tl;dr tourists drove over penguin burrows. no penguins were harmed in the making of this story. just. glad people seem to appreciate the work we do with these super cute (vicious, and smelly) animals. they're worth every ounce of blood, sweat and tears!

[CLS]	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	[SEP]	i was a tour guide for my college on open day. i was leading a group of prospective students and parents, and there was one bunch who didn't appear to have any teenagers with them and spoke only chinese. whatever, maybe they're applying as mature students. my college is pretty obsessive about the lawns. there's only one lawn you're even allowed to walk on (no food, drinks or music allowed though), all the rest carry a 5 fine if you get caught. so we're walking around the lawn on the path, and the chinese group start wandering onto the lawn and away from the tour. i try to bring them back, but they don't seem to understand. another parent asks a question and i have to move on with the tour. we come back around to the lawn a few minutes later and they've set up a small tent and are hammering tent pegs into the perfectly manicured grass. one lady is picking flowers from the flowerbeds. i called security and when they grabbed a passing chinese student to translate that this was unacceptable, the visitors started screaming at the poor guy. they had to be kicked out by police.

""i think my wife was killed by a lion."" gasp, shock. everyone is freaked out, asking him what happened, and as he's trying to explain, the now-irate wife walks up to the campsite and starts yelling. so what had happened? well, they'd walked off, and at some point near the toilets, they both heard a kind of snuffling noise in the underbrush, clearly an animal rooting around. the husband completely freaks out, pushes his wife towards the noise and *down to the ground*, screams, and runs away. spoiler alert, it was not a lion and the wife was not pleased at the attempts at being sacrificed. the guide told us that they didn't speak the entire rest of the trip and they he believes they got divorced. hilarious. tl;dr; don't shove your wife into the ground if you think there is a hungry lion in the underbrush just to save yourself. edit: because mobile."

[SEP]	was at a reptile show and they let out some mini crocodile iguana type thing. i think it was called a dragon something? anyway some kid decides to take his shoe off and wiggle his toes through the small rope gate we were against. presenter says watch your kid, these will bite. kid removes his foot and immediately puts it back in when presented turns around, wiggles his toes again, and this dragon thing *surges* forward and clamps down. kid starts screaming, presenter just looks on like well i told you so and removes it. kid stops screaming, no-one says anything, and presenter moves on. thats what you get for ignoring instructions, and also for not parenting properly. **edit: okay guys i really doubt it was a komodo dragon since the presenter really wasnt worried about it, please stop commenting saying the kid is dead or something. as others have pointed out it was probably a monitor, a chinese water dragon, or a bearded dragon. it was big enough so a monitor sounds correct. i dont need anyone else commenting about whether it was a komodo dragon and whether the kid got help or not. his sock almost came off and he got a fright, thats all, kid was fine**	[SEP]	6637

[CLS]	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	[SEP]	i was a tour guide at a historic village museum (similar to colonial williamsburg). the worst thing was the blatant sexual harassment by some older male visitors towards our female guides (some who obviously look under 16) who wear the old fashioned dresses. you'd be surprised how many men on group tours openly ask our staff members to show them what's under their dress, talk about how it used to be acceptable to marry girls under 16 and how they wish it was still acceptable, or make pretty gross sexual remarks about our staff members in front of the group and i. when you would call them out on their behavior as being inappropriate they would act like you were wrong for getting offended by it and that we should accept it since we were demonstrating life in the 18th century. i heard and saw some pretty bad stuff which would make both the other guests and staff uncomfortable. it also wasn't uncommon for people to sneak away from the tour group to go into restricted areas in an attempt to hunt the ghosts which are supposedly on the property. theres a reason those places are out of bounds, there can be irreplaceable artifacts we don't want accidentally damaged, tools, or the area hasn't been cleared by the fire marshal to allow guest access. small things have been broken by people doing this. people love to get confrontational about being told they can't go into restricted areas or touch the artifacts despite all the signs hung up.

[CLS]	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	[SEP]	during my summers in college, i worked as a raft guide on a whitewater river in the southeast. it wasnt a difficult job; the two biggest things we were responsible for were running our trips in a timely manner and ensuring that the guests in our boat had a fun and safe trip down the river. the safety part is important, because people visiting the river frequently forget that it is a natural wilderness feature and carries all of the associated dangers. we frequently received questions about whether the rafts were on tracks, whether i actually had to do anything in the back, and (my personal favorite) whether the river went in a circle and we would end up back where we started. this last question was particularly funny because we took a bus from the rafting outpost to the put-in of the river  why bother if we were going in a circle?! one summer afternoon, i had a boat with three groups of two people; one of those groups was a mother and son. the mother seemed nice, if timid, as did the son. however, as i was going through the routine of explaining the safety concerns and paddle commands, it started to dawn on me that he was not very bright. there was nothing wrong with him  he was just dumb as shit. once we were on the river, he almost immediately developed a habit of checking the depth of the water with his paddle. he would incessantly plunge the blade into the water without care nor concern for his surroundings and circumstances. the water on this river is pristine. almost crystal clear. the riverbed is visible almost constantly, and still, this young man felt the need to verify the veracity of his own eyeballs by shoving his paddle into the river like some sort of deranged perpetual motion machine. of course, i warned him against his actions. at first, my concerns were that his depth-checking interferes with his ability to follow my commands and paddle. eventually, however, my pleading grew more desperate as it dawned on me that this child paid no deference to my authority. he answered only to chaos. it finally came to a head when, in a portion of the river that was extremely shallow (probably no more than a foot deep), he plunged his paddle into the riverbed with a force that shook the surrounding countryside. like excalibur, the paddle wedged itself among the rocks, perfectly erect. the boy, with a staid iron grip that could only be wielded by someone incredibly dense, kept his hand on the paddle as the rushing water carried us away from its new location. in one swift motion, he was wrenched from the raft and landed in a foot of water. he wore a face of bewildered idiocy. it was quite satisfying to keep his paddle in the back with me for the remainder of the trip after i returned him safely to the raft. all he could do was stare wistfully at the riverbed, his poo brain longing to verify its depth.

[SEP]	"i'm a guide for a popular mainstream brewery. the way tours work there, we always have two guides per tour: one leading and one closing the group, for safety reasons. when we greet people, part of our spiel consists in pointing out the fact that the only toilets are located at the entrance - so right where we are standing at the moment - and the pub at the end of tour. we also make it very clear that no one should at any point be behind the closing guide, no matter what. both of these will be important later on. so, on the day this happened, the other guide and i were alternating between leading and closing. we greeted our group of ~25 people and noticed there was a little boy of around 4 there with his parents. this wasn't the first time something of the sort happened, but i'll never understand why people feel the need to bring their children and even babies to a brewery. much less one that is advertised as being difficult to walk around. oh well. we leave with our group and everything is fine until we reach the brew room. at this point, while my colleague is explaining the beer making process, the father approaches me saying that his son needs the toilet. i tell him that we are close to the pub and ask if he can wait five minutes so we could all leave the brew room together, or if he'd rather the three of us leave for the pub immediately and rejoin the group later on. he answers ""nevermind"" and rejoins the group. after a minute or so, i hear the door to the room opening and closing, this is a big no-no of course, because we need to always be aware of where everyone is. so, i go to investigate and find the father holding his son while he pees around the corner. fml"	[SEP]	191

[SEP]	former horseback tour guide. i have a ton of stories, but the one that sticks with me the most was this lady visiting from new york city. it started when she got out of her car. we tell everyone to wear a shoe with a heal, that helps keep your foot from falling forward through the stirrup. this lady gets out sporting knee high leather boots with 4 heels. she didnt bring any other shoes. i thought, ok, we can make this work, whats the worst that can happen. i put her on the horse and she isnt following directions. she doesnt want to hold the reins or try to control the horse. the horse realizes this and is trying to eat everything in sight. so i get everyone else on their horses, then put this lady directly behind me. once you start moving, the horses know what to do and will just follow me unless you tell them otherwise. pretty foolproof. after about 15 minutes, we get to a place where we try to trot, which is like a slow jog (8mph instead of 4mph). we start to trot, and this lady just starts screaming. she lets go of the reins, grabs the saddle horn and just is screaming at the top of her lungs. her horse is a former racing track horse, hears the screaming and thinks, that means its time to go fast! and they just fly past me. so im at a full gallop chasing after this lady, yelling at her to pick up the reins, but my yelling mixed with her screaming is just making the situation worse. i finally get up next to her and try to get her to calm down and grab the reins. shes still screaming her lungs out, looks over at me and instead decides to grabs onto me. now, when two horses are side by side running, they think oh, were racing. we start picking up as much speed as possible, but her horse is faster than mine and this lady has a death grip on my arm; she isnt letting go. her horse slowly starts pulling away from me and she slowly slides off the back, hits the ground and just rolls. shes covered in mud, but otherwise unscathed. i grab her horse and am able to talk her into getting back on. i gave her a quick lesson and the rest of the trip went off without a hitch, but holy hell.

[SEP]	i was an educator in a museum and we had a summer camp for middle school kids. one day we got to take them on a tour of the roof where we had a garden and a cool view. it was 9 stories up. some of the boys were tossing gravel over the sides so i had to hover near them to get them to behave. then as we were waiting for the single elevator to head down, this big boy (he was probably no more than 11 but was the size of a 16 year old) decides he doesnt wanna wait for the elevator anymore. he grabs the outer doors and pries them open. fortunately, elevator doors are two layers for this very reason. we were not looking down the elevator shaft, but at another set of doors. but that caused the elevator to be unable to open on our level. so then i had to take a group of 20 rowdy 11 year olds down 9 flights of stairs. overall at that job i gave museum tours to hundreds of groups of kids and their parents and without a doubt i can say the parents were more trouble than the kids.

(there was another guide in the front) when we got out to the forest the kids father demanded that we stopped. he wanted me to take a picture of all of them after they got to the top of this super steep mountain. he starts kicking and smacking his horse and he is yelling at all of his family members to do the same before the kid even finishes translating what his father said. i asked the kid to tell them to stop. tell them no. the kid is trying but they are all turning up this hill and not listening. now these horses were well trained and mannered but they also will listen even though they have been trained to stay in line. so the father gets his horse going up this hill and smacks his horses butt one more time and his horse takes off up this mountain. idk if anyone has watched how a horse runns up a mountain but the almost hop. its not easy to stay on. the worst part is, about 7 of the 12 horses follow suite and start running up this mountain. the other guide and i look at one another in panic mode as all these peoples screams are fading up this hill. thankfully the other guide and i can think quick. she grabs the few remaining horses that didnt run as all of their riders are also screaming and crying and yelling. i decide i need the translator boy to stay with me so i tell him what i am going to do, how to hold on and i ask him if he thinks he can do it so we can go stop all these horses. he nods leans forward and holds on as i get both are horses running up the hill. when i reach the top 4 of the older horses had slowed down and were eating so i tell the boy to tell them to get off the horses. he replies they dont know how and are too scared i (try not to show my irritation) jump off my horse as i tell him to give them my instructions step for step. he does but they all shake their heads as they are death gripping the horn. thank god asians are usually light and small. i basicaly had to lift/drag them off of the horses. i told them all to start walking down the hill and go with the others. i tied up their horses to the nearest tree asked the boy to hold on tight again and took off looking for the others. i finally found a younger man and his wife(?) she was covered in pine needles with a few scratches on her arms and covered in dirt. the boy (i assume) asks what happened then tells me her horse went under a tree and she didnt fit. the mans horse was behind hers so it stopped barely missing her and he got off to help her. i again told them to start walking and i tie up his horse. so now i have 2 missing horses and 1 missing tourist. it took me and that boy 40 min to finally catch up and find his father. this poor boy was so embarrassed and worried and when we finally catch up to him and his horse and the riderless horse trailing behind he looks up and says ""ya, real cowboys now! huh son."" i grabbed this dudes reigns and told his son to tell him to get off of his horse now! i told him to follow us and have him walk behind my horse, his sons horse and the now 2 riderless horses tied in a pack line. the father was angry and kept talking to his son but his son was so mad at him he would not reply or even look back at him. the poor kids face was so red. the other guide had managed to get all the other riders and horses back to the stable by the time we got back and when i pulled that kid off of his horse i looked him in the eyes and i told him how thankful i was for him and how brave he was. i told him to stay strong and to hold his chin high because he did the right thing. i told him he was a hero and an excellent rider because that was a lot for a 9 year old kid to handle for his first time on a horse. that day was an unforgetable nightmare. but that kid was a champion."

[CLS]	tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	[SEP]	i worked in amsterdam as a pub crawl guide for 6 months a couple years ago. a normal night we could have between 50 and 80 people, however during the summer those numbers double. so one night we're still at the start point before the crawl starts and a big group of lads come to join. they were on a stag and clearly out for a mad one. the crawl would start with an hour of cheap beers and free shots from the guides, these lads tore through our supplies. as we start, they're all already pretty smashed but aside from being loud, they're fine. as the crawl progresses however, some of them started disappearing and reappearing. we would always warn the pub crawlers to not buy drugs from street dealers but we were busy with guiding and aren't babysitting anyone (unless they need it and i'd get them water and a safe way to where ever they needed to go). it's about the 4th pub (out of 6) and it's clear the lads on the stag are buzzing. half are smiling so brightly that you'd swear there was a literal supernova of lightbulbs going off in their heads, the other half are drooling through the smiles and gurning. it's at this point that shit took off. suddenly one of the lads had a massive stuffed eagle. he didn't have it at the beginning but now we had about 30 lads off their tits bowing and praising a massive stuffed eagle that one is holding over his head. one of the other lads shouts that they need to make an offering, and then throws his pint at it. this generates a huge laugh and then the lads all shower the eagle with booze. everyone is in hysterics at this point. then the first glass was smashed. i think it was an accident, but the next 30 glasses smashing wasn't. the lads went fucking insane, they started throwing chairs around the place and smashing glasses. a few fights break out as there's a bunch of other people in this pub who aren't taking their shit. amid the chaos, the guy with the eagle is still standing in the middle holding it up and beseeching everyone to be calm like the eagle. so at this point, the other guides and i looked at each other and shrugged and started moving the rest of the pub crawlers along, keeping all these people here wasn't going to help the situation. so we continued, until a few of the lads caught up down the street a bit. they tried to start a fight with a random passerby, but two of them got cleanly knocked out by the guy before the others backed down. more shit i have to deal with, so i tell my buddy to keep the crawl going and i called the ambulance. once the two lads were taken care of i took off and finished the crawl. the shittiest thing is what happened afterwards. one of the two lads, once arriving at the hospital, immediately took off and walked away, refusing help. the police picked him up and seeing he was fucked up, took him back to the hospital. he ran again, and again they picked him up and brought him in. they warned him that if he ran off again then he'd be sleeping it off in a cell, but of course he ran again. some point during the night this fella died in the cell of an overdose. he had taken some shite from a street dealer and was one of many who had died from some white powder heroin that was being sold as cocaine. tl;dr: died.

[SEP]	former horse trail guide. group of 6 on the trail, plus me at the rear for safety and our leader up ahead. the ride was a faster ride, meant to be for people who already had some experience riding and wanted excitement. old witch (ow) and her grandson of about 12 (gs) were 2 of the riders. ow disregards all safety rules from minute 1. we ask them to ride in single file and not overtake each other as horses tend to fight when they think theyre being overtaken. ow wanted to go both in front and behind of her gs and wouldnt take no for an answer. for the first 20 minutes she repeatedly kicked her horse forward and then took a photo, and then took him back behind gs. both horses were getting upset and gs was getting frightened because he did not have any riding skills at all and his horse was getting alarmed. this conversation happened: me: maam please keep your horse in its place in the line. your grandsons horse is getting upset and he isnt enjoying the ride because of that. ow: how long have you been riding? how old are you? me: im 18 and ive been riding for 12 years ma-am. ow: well ive been riding 40 years. thats a bit longer, dont you think? me: im sorry but these are our horses and im responsible for your grandsons safety. it isnt safe to keep overtaking him. she stopped the shenanigans for a bit. then we got to the fast part of the ride. theres a fire break - a long sand track by a fence - that we always used for a fast run. the horses knew it and rarely needed more than a little kick to go fast there. ow was behind gs at this point after finally stopping with her photographs. we stop before the fast part for a safety instruction which consists of you dont have to make the horse go fast, it will follow the leader, but feel free to give it a kick if it doesnt, and remember to lean back not forward, and try not to overtake. i swear to god ow looked back at me and smirked as my coworker said those words. ow was on a lovely, responsive horse. we would use this horse when 5 or 6 year old children were on beginner rides and he never ever played up. as soon as they got onto the fast strip, she literally booted him so loud that i could hear it like a drum. the horse was afraid and fucking took off at top speed - barrelling through the other riders, including ows grandson. two other riders had their horses swerve into tree branches and were knocked off. she put literally every person in the ride in danger. her grandson fell off. i helped him back up and he was crying and too afraid to even start going again, so i had to put him behind me, and ow in front of me so that ow could not possibly fuck up his horse any more. she then proceeded to ask my name and tell me she would get me fired. this made my day because i worked for my mum and also i had been fired literally 2 days earlier in an argument with my mum and i was back because she needed me. ow seemed pissed that i didnt care one bit. she never did complain about me though and her grandson was so sweet and really appreciated being behind me and not subject to her horse upsetting his. i felt so bad for the kid.

'i'm an artist myself and it takes hours to get the colours just right. what's the point if you can't see it properly?' well if you're an artist, flower, you'll know all about light damage won't you? on one occasion we had an amazing pre-raphaelite painting on loan. no guards, no barrier-you could get up close and personal to it-it was amazing! yep, you've guessed it. we had someone whinge the lighting then. i explained the reasoning and that the light levels were a condition of the loan and the insurance, but no. her needs are far more important than the conservation of a silly old painting. people trying to donate actual rubbish to the collections-connect four with half the pieces missing, that kind of thing-and getting very arsey when we politely thanked them for their trouble and advised that 'we actually already have one of those'. a teacher with absolutely no control over her class who were running around *screaming* and smacking into cases. in fact, i saw a couple of bullies with a little boy shoved up against one of the cases. this was a really small museum too, so it's not like she can't have noticed. when i spoke with her about it she did the 'children! behave or the lady is going to make us all leave!' no wonder she had no control if she never took any responsibility. finding a drug addict in a jacobean four poster bed because 'they were tired'. there are loads more, but these are the ones i can remember. i guess they seem pretty minor, but when you get the same scenario over and over, there's definitely cumulative frustration which lead to lower tolerance of the public!

""kind, funny, and generous"" are only three of the dozen words i could use to describe him. however. i'd sourced him some cocaine during my guide of the best bars and sights of the city we were in. well, i'd *subtly* said ""that guy in the hat is known as a cocaine dealer. other people have told me his blow is the best."". the trouble began when the cops came to close down some of the bars on this party-street. we were outside having a cigarette. i mean, the trouble didn't start then. the trouble really began when he threw a beer bottle at the wall, then started peeing on a police ute. please note, this is while there were approximately thirty armed police on the block. some had shotguns. some, rifles. all of them had at least pistols. a few even had batons. somehow, i managed to distract, apologize, and generally diffuse the situation. he started panicking, not least because he had about $500 usd in drugs in his pickets, but also swearing about ""these fucking pigs, i could buy them all off, they don't know me, i have more shit in my pocket than they earn in a month"". but thankfully the police within earshot did not speak english. i translated completely the opposite of what he said to me. i managed to persuade the nearest cops that this 'gentleman' was, while very drunk, sincerely apologetic for his urination. i told them i was taking him home. i would look after him. with my arm over his shoulders and still spewing apologies to the police in spanish, i said to him ""bro, shut up and walk, act drunk, do not yell, say nothing but your highschool-spanish words for apology, and walk with me and do not mention the things in your pocket again."". we made it to the corner. as we turned, some other police who obviously understood english got closer and started yelling at us to stop. i didn't stop. i pushed idiot-dj around the corner, then said"" run!"". we ran a few blocks. he tipped me $250usd, over two weeks wages for me at the time."

[SEP]	i was a little sad to see my local k-mart go. i went there around thanksgiving last year, just after they set up their christmas section. i don't know whether the plan was drawn up in some regional or national headquarters, or if it was a local effort. but somebody, somewhere, had put a lot of effort into making the christmas section at my local k-mart something pretty special. it was nice looking, lots of trees everywhere, toys, decorations on display, the works. and all i could think was that those had been set up just in time for the store to close down. made me sad a little.

[SEP]	magazines in general seem to be part of a bygone era. if you had a specialist interest or hobby a magazine subscription was the best way to keep in the loop and have a monthly dose of excitement. now internet communities are much more plentiful and specified but there's no longer the depth of information as when it was compiled by experts and promoted with beautiful pictures and layouts.

[SEP]	met my boyfriend on the /r/meetpeople subreddit 2 years ago we became friends and became officially a couple 1,5 year ago. its amazing to me how someone can become such an important part of your daily life. even though he is so far away i have never felt this close to anyone before. something that i really like is that we communicate in a respectful way even if there is conflict. we try and always be open and honest, and i believe we are both very empathetic to each others feelings and struggles :)	[SEP]	323

[SEP]	"i found the woman that took care of my father before he died. i had never met nor seen a photo of my father my entire adult life. long story short, i knew his name, his social security number and that he was born in marseille, france. posted something to reddit private investigators - a few days later, a fellow redditor on that forum gave me a name and phone number of someone that was listed as relative or close friend (he did this for free). i called her and she returned my call. thanks to that great man / redditor i later exchanged letters with ""rose"", she told me how my father died of dementia, how they met, sent me photos of my father and my distant sister (i never knew i had). it was closure of not knowing him, not ever seeing photos and details on a chapter of my life i never thought i would know. so, yes, reddit can be a great and powerful tool thanks to a great community."

[SEP]	"met on a subreddit's discord server during a strange time in my life. we and a few others branched off into our own group, played video games together and some nights there'd just be three of us sat up late at night talking about anything. sometimes the other guy went to bed, other times we all went off at the same time. i fell for this guy on his voice and personality at first - as odd as that sounds, he was such a *nice* person to be around and talk to, and he had a nice voice. when he sent me a photo of himself he was also very much my type. a short while later, i get tired of dropping hints hoping he'd ask me or initiate the ""romance talk"", so i took the bull by the horns and told him how i felt. he admitted he'd never actually considered an ldr, took a few days to process and then he got back to me and admitted i'd been on his mind a lot and he felt he was starting to feel the same way about me. we've been together for nearly two years now, in an ldr that's about 400 miles apart. we're closing the distance in less than 7 weeks time now, though. i can't wait :)"	[SEP]	246

[SEP]	i actually met my so on reddit while posting in r4r specifically for a platonic friend! &#x200b; i did talk to some cool people who responded, one or two for even a couple of months after, but with my fiancee it was like an instant click. i've been married before and had various other long term and meaningful relationships, but nothing like this at all. the kind of person who makes you feel dumb for thinking anyone else you'd ever been with could have worked out, and i knew i was going to want more than friendship after just a couple of hours. &#x200b; we live 2200 miles apart (3540km), but she bought a plane ticket to come see me after 48 hours of (almost constant) talking (shes the adventurous one)! within a month i was picking her up at the airport! we've been together for 19 months now and usually see each other about every 6 to 10 weeks. &#x200b; still, by an incredible lead, the best relationship i've ever been in or experienced.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	my fiancee and i met through an r4r post i made on a throwaway account. we were starting to click , but then i sent a picture of myself and didn't hear back from her for over a week. considering we we're sending messages back and forth a few times a day, i was pretty certain i scared her off with how i looked. so i sorta gave up and didn't log back into that account for almost a month. if it weren't for me just checking to see if i ever got any messages, i don't think we ever would've met. turns out she was just really late sending a response and picture back to me. in a panic i messaged her immediately. after our near-miss with each other, we slowly built up to meeting in person and it's been awesome ever since. that was over 5 years ago and we're getting married next winter :)	[SEP]	38

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	wasnt on reddit, but i had a friend i met on myspace around 2005, and we kept in touch for a decade or so, sharing band recommendations and chatting. since we lived across the country from each other, neither of us sought any kind of relationship with the other. we tried to meet whenever one of us would be in or around the others neck of the woods, but it just never happened. i was diagnosed with cancer about five years ago, and he determined that he had to do whatever it took to meet me before it was too late. my mom and i were vacationing a few states away, and he drove several hours to hang out. we all had a great time and it was hard for us to say goodbye, especially after the short visit wed planned ended up extending all the way into the next morning (with encouragement from mom and even our airbnb host). we planned a longer visit after i flew home, and spent a wonderful ten days together, after which he asked if i wanted to be in a relationship with him. i declined because i was afraid that, if my cancer killed me in a few years, he wouldve wasted his time when he couldve been with someone in better health. my ex felt that i shouldve been grateful he stuck around after my diagnosis, so i wanted to spare anyone else the burden of being with me. to my surprise, this wonderful man insisted he wanted to be with me no matter what challenges lay ahead. weve been together almost three years, and not once has he made me feel unworthy or unloved despite all my flaws (hair loss, surgery scars, er visits, and other fun problems caused by the cancer or medication). we got married last december and im currently in the process of selling my place and moving to the new house he bought for us. we may have met on myspace, but reddit is one of the main things we bond over now.

[SEP]	i met my boyfriend on a video game subreddit looking for people to play with. i made a post and got a solid handful of replies but for some reason, his was the only one i responded to. we ended up playing and talking that night and it didn't stop until the early morning. it felt so easy and so. right. i never vibed with someone like that before. i felt like he was my other half. in fact, he (thankfully) felt the same way and we've been dating ever since! it's been 1.5 years and i'm still just as giddy over him as that first night. i've never been happier. i love him so much.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	i started playing a video game called digital paintball 2 around 2006 (i was around 12/13) and happened to play and team with mainly people in na (am eu), which lead to several years of awkwardly timed gaming sessions. met a group on that game i got on with very well, and eventually (in 2010ish) one of their girlfriends. theyd ask me if i had any plans to be in their cities or states at some point, as we became very good friends playing games for so many years. i told the couple id come to their wedding if they ever got married, which at the time they kinda brushed off. &#x200b; a few months ago they told me about their engagement and told me theyd love it if i could come. so, im all booked to go to their wedding in boston in july. its wild, i played games with and just generally spent a huge amount of time with these people, and now i finally get to keep my promise and see these two people i have a great deal of love for get married. they invited me to their pre and post wedding family celebrations, so im super excited to share in their special time.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	the simple story: we were both in relationships with other people who were absolutely horrible. i made a post on an r4r subreddit specifically looking for a hookup. his genuineness was just so tangible in his message and we were in the same (ethically non-monogamous, the fact that we were with shitty people became apparent later) situation that i felt drawn to him right away. this was strange for me because i was also posting on other subreddits (r/gonewild[fill in the blank], which i met my ex on)that had me interacting with tons of guys on the daily due to the explicit stuff i was posting. so i was desensitized and kinda disillusioned by guys pickup lines (even the ones that seemed polite and nice) we meet. we hookup. i stay the night, mostly because we lost track of time and connected right away. were *very* different people but also extremely the same. we get breakfast the next day. i go home and think about him the entire week. the next week he breaks up with his girlfriend. the week after that, i break up with my boyfriend. we dont have a talk about being official right away because it just doesnt seem important. he says i love you very soon and i say it back because i feel it and i mean it. two months later, and i had drawers of things at his place. a little more time and we meet each others families. we just got married today.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	well my story may be the weirdest one among all these. i was going through a phase where i was hitting the gym very often and getting some really good results, combine this the fact that i have a small ego that needs confirmation through posting pics of myself online.eventually i am posting myself to the r/guysgonewild sub with full body showing but nothing too explicit (genitals are covered). next thing i know i am on the front page of the sub and an inbox full of messages from females and males alike (50-50 ratio), a lot of them just wanted to sext and as a straight male i obliged and had some fun with the girls over snapchat or what have you. however i should note that i never respond to these messages asking for sexts or anything, i simply have genuine conversations with most of them and it ends in sexting in most cases. one girl however never got to the point of asking me for sexual favors and instead we spoke a lot about the meaning of life and how crazy this reality of a universe we live in is, we even got into deeper quantum mechanics than i have with any other person before. i was very much falling for her and she reciprocated the same feelings for me, we exchanged numbers and ended up texting each other daily and eventually calling each other every night for months. a year or so later i move out of my parents place and decided to rent an apartment with her. today we are still together going on 2 years soon and feel like we are each others soul mates lol	[SEP]	70

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	met my so on /r/r4r. i was looking to meet a girl and my so responded. she was local which was pretty cool and we sent long messages back and forth for a few days. i had not been having great experiences with my dates from okcupid and she mentioned she had some bad experiences dating too and she was just really looking for friends. i was kind of tired of the whole dating thing myself (it's super exuasting mentally and emotionally) so the just friends thing sounded pretty good to me. we started hanging out pretty regularly pretty soon after we met up. her best friend came along a lot too. we had a bunch of fun and where hanging out several times a week (which is a lot when you're a full time college student with a job and they live 50 minutes away). after about 3 or 4 months of casually hanging out we decided to go take a trip to a place 4 hours outside the city to go try out astrophotography. we did it twice within 2 weeks for a total of 16 hours of driving so we got to just talk a lot. we opened up with each other and shared a lot of personal stuff during the drives and really got to know each other on a more real level. i just remember on the way back from one of the trips after conversation had died down just sitting there and thinking how awesome she was and how much i liked her. about 2 or 3 weeks later we ended up officially dating and have been going strong for almost 3 years now. come to find out she was thinking the same thing during our star gazing trip. it was the moment we both knew we wanted each other. i just moved states for a job this weekend and she put in her 2 weeks notice last week and will be joining me in my new apartment very soon :).

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	almost a year ago i was in one of the darkest depressions of my life. i told the guy i was sort of dating at the time (he never called me his girlfriend because he wasnt ready) i was thinking pretty seriously about killing myself. i wasnt trying to play him for sympathy, but i was very afraid and never had such obsessive thoughts about it before. he was worried for maybe a day, then blew it off. one night i felt particularly low, and for the first time ever looked for someone online. i went through dozens of posts on a sub for people meeting each other and chatting using the app kik. i chose the one i felt was the most sincere, albeit a little sad, downloaded the app, and sent that person a message. 258 days later, that guy who didnt care about me has dumped me twice, and ive cut him out of my life. this stranger i met on reddit and started chatting with on kik is my whole support system. we talk everyday and all night. last week he flew across the country to meet me and my cats, and we had a blast together. when im sad, he always knows just what to say and i am no longer in that dark frightening pit. were there for each other. im there when he is sad too. we plays lots of games together, and now weve even done that in person! he reads to me sometimes (because hes very eloquent) and i can tell him all my secret. he likes to watch me draw sometimes when i work up the courage to do so. now i can say i have a boyfriend who loves me!

[SEP]	in december 2011, i got out of a. sub-optimal relationship, and i was looking for a new adventure. i posted on /r/idliketobeatree, a smallish community i'd found refuge in, saying i was taking a road trip from wichita to nyc, and that i'd like to meet up with people from the sub along the way. one person responded, and we met just outside of st. louis, mo. he was a mod of the subreddit, and we skyped a few times beforehand, so i found myself trusting him. found out he was moving to a town in kansas only a half hour away from me, and barely a month later we started a beautiful relationship, the best five years i've ever known. he showed me what it means to be truly good and kind. i'm so grateful i took a chance on a random sub.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	we didn't exactly meet on reddit but i have gotten her on reddit now! we met on a site called emerald chat, she thought i was this young girl because of my personality. but our talk on the website was great, added each other in there, talked more. now we exchanged skypes and within 1 week of having each other on skype i told her that i loved her because i didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell my feelings for her, especially when you don't know what the next day entails for such a distance. i'm in the us and she's in malaysia so the time difference was massive and she's busy with university. we've had our ups and downs but we keep pushing through it. a year in i had the weird idea of giving her a middle name as malay's typically don't have middle names. so we went through some names and picked out one she likes, and she's absolutely in love with it now. the way she smiles when i refer to her as that name just makes my heart tick faster. i fall asleep in calls with her all the time and she puts up with it and finds it calming just watching me sleep, hell. before we were dating we fell asleep together in a voice call on skype. i can't say i regret because i don't. i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her. thanks for putting up with the flow of my short story. i know it's a bit chaotic.

[SEP]	it was the midnight premier of the first avengers movie. a bunch of friends and i went to go see it. my theater was having a marathon of the movies before it, i decided i wanted to sneak in to see them. my friends did not so i went in to watch captain america alone. after a while they started texting me telling me that there was a girl sitting in front of them who had the exact same interests as me, doctor who, mlp, etc and i should come meet her. i was reluctant at first, but then they started calling me and i had to leave the theater. i met this girl, she was lovely, we traded numbers, and we've been together for 7 years now, got married almost two years ago	[SEP]	8
[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	i was going to a university far away and posted on reddit about the hall i would be staying in. someone commented they were also staying in that hall. we chatted for a bit and then said we would see each other there. 4 months later after completely forgetting about this interaction i started dating this girl and about 2 weeks in she was talking about someone she has been trying to find in our hall who she talked to on reddit a few months ago. i connected the dots, brought up my comment history and asked her if that was her. so turns out, out of all 300 people i could have got with, i chose the one that i chatted to on a unanynous website without even knowing.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	met my current girlfriend about a year ago. i followed her on instagram before i texted her, and always thought she was cute. well one night i was drunk and my good friend had a picture of them on his story (hes gay, i didnt steal her from him) and i said fuck it, im drunk, i got nothing to lose and 2 days later we met in person. we avoided the entire awkward stage because she was baked when i met her, and i was drunk. we just acted like we knew each other for years and its never changed.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	"dec 2017, i moved in a new city, a university town in the middle of proverbial nowhere. it's a small city by my standards (population of 300k here vs the 5m tourist city where i just was vs the 13m capital city where i grew up). i don't speak the local language(s), the pocket community that does speak english are families and religious people, and had a hard time looking for my own crowd. i saw a thread talking about the city, someone said that ""so-and-so city is dank"" and i jumped ""where is the dankness,"" because the city is nothing but bars and sand and bars and more sand and sometimes camels (it's in the edge of the desert). before i arrived, i also made a similar post in the same sub before about what to do in the city. this guy pops in and suggests places to go to, then he messages me if we could hang out sometime. i've hung out with people from reddit before, they were mostly cool, so i was like, sure. he didn't know i was a girl. been dating ever since, moved in october last year, and he's a sweet, wonderful man who's probably reading this post in a few hours because we openly stalk each other's reddit profiles. ^^^^hey. ^^^^get ^^^^to ^^^^work."

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	i met her after she moved away from my high school, how convenient right? we actually learned we had a lot in common and skyped and facetimed everyday and always talked about thing in life. that was freshman and sophomore year. finally she moved back because her dad found a new job here and we have officially started to be together. i couldnt think a week we havent spent together.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	i met my partner of five years here, i made a post looking for friends on r4r and he responded. we texted for a month or two then i went to seattle to meet him. at that point we started hanging out every so often as friends. eventually we moved to dating after we both realized we wanted more and now it's been over five years since we started officially dating. not a fairy tale love story but we work well together and he's the best thing to happen to me :)	[SEP]	6

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	6 months ago, i went on a date with a girl i met on a dating app. she tells me that i remind her of one of her friends. she tells me that this friend is armenian, like me. she tells me her friend is into classic cars, like me. she sent me a photo of this beautiful 1967 chevy impala that belonged to her friend. she tells me ive got the same sense of humor as her friend. heck, she says if we dont work out, maybe ill set you up with her!. long story short, we didnt work out. one day, weeks after that date, im scrolling through r/classiccars. low and behold i see a photo of this gorgeous blue 1967 impala get posted. something about the photo sticks with me. it hits me that this is the exact same photo the girl sent me. im thinking no way! this has to be her armenian friend. i take a chance and send a pm to her. i was right, it was the same person i thought it was. she sent me her number to talk cars, and talk we did! turns out we have almost everything in common. we made each other laugh like crazy. we have the same sense of humor. were both artists in our own way. we both love classic muscle cars. we both love 90s music. we both basically have the same train of thought. she used to work at the company i work at now. were both in tech. we both struggled with past relationships. we send each other the exact same gifs at the same time. her weird is my kinda weird. we also both have insanely bushy armenian eyebrows (but she takes care of hers). we went on a date and within an hour, we were saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. seriously, at least once a day we say the same thing at the same time. weve been together ever since. i found my soul mate on reddit. i found my life partner. i found someone i never knew could be so incredible (and real) on reddit. so thank you reddit! and more importantly thank you u/youllregreddit for responding to a spontaneous, weird, anonymous message on reddit 6 months ago, and i cant wait for the rest of our lifetimes together!

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	we met 4 years ago today! (well, it was sunday 17th may 2015) i posted in our local sub in the april about a meetup and we ended up doing our own instead. 4 years later, we are amazingly happy. he lives with me and we just had a lovely day today with our blended family - my daughter, his son, his mum, and the two of us all sat outside in the garden having tea. we are so happy and grateful to reddit for bringing us together.

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	i met my now husband on r/loseit in 2012. i was in the chat talking to everyone and happened to mention i was australian. husband said he loved utes and was obsesssed with holden cars. we struck up a friendship and spoke almost every day for years. i moved instate and the communication kinda died off. i was so upset by it but life was crazy for me and i was isolated from family and friends. in 2016 our communication started up again and i realised that what i had been feeling was more than just friendly feelings towards him. but how would it work? he was in florida and i was in australia. it seemed impossible. one night, we were having a deep and meaningful conversation and he told me he had feelings for me. i was so happy! i told him i absolutely felt the same and we decided we would do whatever it took to make this work. i met him in person in march 2017 when i flew over and spent a month with him. we were exactly the same in person as we were on skype/chat. he came to australia last year for two weeks and i got to show him the now closed holden factory and he got to hold a koala and feed kangaroos. it was so much fun. in july he proposed to me via video chat (which was perfect for my introverted self) and of course i said yes. we were married when i flew there for xmas last year and have now filed for the cr1 visa. the 16 month wait until we close the gap as begun!!!

[CLS]	people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	[SEP]	we met on /r/ohior4r. no lie, i was cruising for booty, she was looking for a hookup and casual dating. she made a post, i noticed it about a week after she posted but i figured i would try anyways. i pmed her and asked if she was still looking, she wrote back about an hour later saying she was. we got to texting, things got flirty, we exchanged some pictures and decided wed go out to dinner that night. dinner was great, full of great conversation. then we get done and i walk her to her car. we starting making out pretty hard and then she says, i guess i can take you home. we get to her place and instantly get into some hot and heavy sex. we ended up having sex four times that night, and we kept it up for the next month. after a month of wild sex and hanging out, we found out we had a ton of things in common. we started officially dating in may of 2015, and were still together now. in fact im going to propose to her this year.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	my high school gf worked there way back in the day. she said the worst part of the day was having to collect merchandise from the fitting rooms and cleaning the fitting rooms. apparently, all sorts of nasty women would go in there and try on the panties, not use a liner and just generally leave them all crusty and bad smelling. they would also leave pads and tampons all over. she said they had to throw away so much merchandise that was left in that condition. i feel like this may be a problem anywhere they sell clothes but then again hot topic may attract a different type of customer so it might have happened more often?	[SEP]	2313
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i worked at a hot topic in '99-'00. we used to get a fair amount of strippers that came in because we were the only place around that sold see-through vinyl bikini tops and 6 inch stack boots and shit like that. anyway, our fitting room was basically a hole cut in a wall with a mirror and a thick curtain that had to be pulled close just right. this one day, a stripper came in to try on a bunch of stuff and really didn't even bother with the curtain. apparently, she was so used to people seeing her naked that it wasn't a big deal for her. granted, this was a weekday morning and she and her boyfriend/manager/bodyguard or whatever were the only people in the store besides my manager and me. at one point she just stopped using the fitting room altogether and was just using the full length mirror on the door to the stockroom/office. my manager and i really had no idea what to do, because at this point she's got about $1500-$2000 worth of merchandise that she's probably buying, and this lady is good for both business *and* morale. she didn't seem to be worried at the prospect of anyone seeing her, and the way our store was set up was really narrow and long, and the display fixtures were tall and bulky. it was very difficult to see into and out of the store unless you were standing in the center aisle. it made loss prevention a nightmare, but really allowed this lady to let her freak flag fly. she finally puts her clothes on at the cash wrap as she's checking out. my manager gave me so much shit after that because i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact with the customer while i rang her up. that was the largest transaction i ever rang up in my time there, and paid for it with the largest wad of cash i'd ever seen in my life up to that point. **tl;dr a stripper came in on a slow day and treated the store like her own private dressing room.**	[SEP]	773
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i worked at hot topic about 8 years ago. for the most part, the gig was the best part-time job i ever had. great managers, great coworkers, great customers. only 2 instances stand out in my mind. 1. this was around when twilight was big. middle-aged women would come in and ask where the edward/jacob merch was and then just start fawning over them in the most uncomfortable way. 2. my actual interview. it was a group interview. one of the questions was something about either a difficult customer service moment or something. this one guy (obvious ht scene type) proudly talks about the time he worked at a bookstore and sucker-punched a female customer in the face for calling his style weird/freaky/something. i never saw that guy again so i dont think he got the job.	[SEP]	1935
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	"i worked for 2 years at my local hot topic and the worst stories both involved the fitting room. our fitting room used to be a self-service room in the back of the store with a red curtain in front of it. an employee noticed 4 feet in the room and opened it to find two people having sex in it and had to clean up the remnants. a second incident came when a smell wafted from the same room. it was later discovered that someone had actually taken a dump in the room when they went in to ""try on clothes"". we ended up fitted the room with a galvanized piece of chain and a masterlock to keep the curtain open. luckily, shortly thereafter, we got a full store overhaul that put in actual fitting rooms."

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	not a horror story but a ridiculous short one. i had a woman come in with her sleeping infant and screamed at me to turn off the music while she strolled around the store. i mean if your baby is sleeping and you want them to continue, maybe dont come to browse the store that you can hear music blasting from the other side of the mall, idk what to tell ya haha.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	thursday is actually my last day with hot topic after 4 years! in general the company is amazing to its employees and ive met some incredible people. but boy do i have stories!! 1. i once found a condom on our anime section. it was open and filled with.something. 2. we had a girl who i am positive had some mental issue because she would get into the fitting room and try to lure anyone in there to help her then try and seduce them. she was actually pretty but young and filled to the brim with crazy. 3. alice cooper came into the store once. totally unannounced and brought a teacup pig. absolutely wonderful person. gave our metalhead associate tickets to his show and this dude about lost it. 4. also met machine gun kelly, mayday parade, we the kings, and max green of escape the fate. mgk and the vocalist for wtk were assholes. 5. we had a guy get thrown against the front gate on the morning of a funko pop release. in general the job has taught me some pop collectors are grads a assholes. 6. had a woman ask me if she should go back to stripping after her c section, then lifted her shirt to show me the scar and her tits. 7. we found out there was a group of mallrats who wrote fan fiction about the staff at our store. i never got to see any and im glad for that.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i was working on the sales floor and this guyat least in his 30s and pretty highstarts making sexual comments to me about this 15ish girl that was checking out. i asked him to leave and nothing more came of it but ich it was chilling. also had a co-worker get fired because they were selling weed out of the back room. shed sneak it into their bag while they were checking out. also had a different, off-duty, co-worker come in hammered late one night to tell everyone working how great we were. that was actually kinda nice. besides that, it was a lot of kicking out vaping teenagers and letting the quiet girls from my school try on skimpy harley quinn bikinis in the dressing room. edit:grammar	[SEP]	2594
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	"worked there for 13 years. soooo much weird, but that's just retail in general. caught a guy masturbating into women's shoes in the dressing room. people had sex in there more often than you'd be comfortable with. i worked for them when columbine happened. we carried a brand of clothing back then called serial killer, which featured pop culture pics/references and some edgy saying, like a pic of bruce lee that said ""revenge"" or something like that. the morning after columbine happened, we got an email to pull all the serial killer clothing line off the sales floor, as well as every trenchcoat in the store. by the end of the day i'd already had to call security twice due to people showing up at the store and harassing me for 'supporting those psychos' and 'training the next ones'. then the tv networks showed up and pretty much camped the front of our store, harassing every customer as they walked in/out, asking them why this 'dark lifestyle' attracted them. the mall ended up having security just hang out in front of our store and walking our employees to their cars for a week afterward. honestly, it was the best job i ever had. the company was really supportive at the corporate level. i still have friends that work there. they pretty much left me alone so long as i made sales, so i had carte blanche to set up my stores the way i wanted even if it didn't look like the planned merchandising setups they sent out. i had direct access with every dept, so if i felt my stores couldn't sell something they sent us, they'd let me transfer it somewhere else, and vice versa, get more best sellers in. honestly, if it wasn't for the working every weekend and closing a lot stuff, i would have continued working there."

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	former employee. i worked a whole 3 months in summer, so all the kids were out and about. i was stocking disney merchandise and i couldn't help but notice a kid underneath one of our clearance racks. i heard some strange noise coming from there too so i crouch under and look at the kid. he had a button, needle and all, in his mouth. i asked him where his parents were and before i knew it he swallowed the pin and ran out of the store. i couldn't leave and go search for the child so i let security know about the button kid. never knew what happened after that. i can't seem to forget button kid though.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	"spent almost 5 years working at one in the early 2000's. being in the midwest, we had a ton of juggalos but they were actually pretty nice people in general. i had a group of kids ask what i would do if they ""set some clothes on fire"" and flicked a lighter multiple times. we mostly got weirdos who wanted to bang in the dressing room or lifted up their shirts to ask me what gauge their nipple ring is. we had this one girl who came in weekly and i dont think she was all there. she would sit at the listening station for way too long and then leave. one day she sat down and put the headphones on. she had a plastic bag with her filled with empty glass bottles and peaches (yes, the fruit). we noticed it was leaking onto the floor but just let her do her thing. she put the headphones back and looked at her leaking bag. she had a mildly disappointed look on her face but immediately looked at her watch and yelled ""i'm going to miss my bus!"". she ran out of the store and up to a trash can outside the store. she held the bag up high and yelled ""peaches meet your fate!!!"", threw the bag in the trash, and sprinted off. that job was weird."	[SEP]	5353
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	former employee of a couple years in high school. i loved that job. the biggest horror story that sticks out in my mind was this guy that would always come in with his kids. he was a huge icp fan, and from the looks of it, he let his kids (both boys, they were i'd guess maybe 7 and 8 at the time) listen as well. they always had hatchet man stuff on and pretty bitchin' haircuts. they always misbehaved, just running around the store screaming, sometimes crashing into stuff, and the dad gave no fucks. he was often pretty rude to us in the store about not having specific merch or being out of stuff in his size (he was a large guy.) i had and still have no business in what that guy does with his kids, but i always felt a little bad that there was a good chance they would end up in a bad way. other than that reoccurring instance, for the most part our store was really fun.	[SEP]	5277
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i worked for hot topic for about 7 years. my store was apparently the juggalo store of the district, and i think the state. working for that company as long as i did, i was pretty used to ignoring people's crappy taste, but the juggalos were different. this is in central florida, so it's on average about 90 degrees most days and always humid as hell. these kids were always very overweight, wearing a massive black icp tee, those ridiculous 30 pound black tripp pants with huge pockets and all the hardware (chains and straps) hanging from them, and they were drenched in sweat (their hygiene was almost always awful). they always seemed to show whenever a new icp shirt or collectible would arrive, and would smell up the store and pay in wadded up, sweat soaked money. it was just all around unpleasant. the smell would linger for a bit after they left. it was not pleasant.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	this is my time to shine. i was helping a lady at the disney section. she was pretty particular about the things she wanted and was asking if they looked okay enough for her. being my first job i was really enthusiastic about being a sales person and i really do love disney. so i was hyping her up the best i could and were laughing together, getting along really well. then she says, yeah i wanted to get all the same things my boyfriends baby mama has, is that weird? literally did not know how to respond. i said it wasnt and cashed her out quick.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	this was my first job in my college town, and generally, i absolutely loved it. youre treated like some super cool mini-celebrity by all the little mall rats, the management was generally great to their employees, and the work wasnt too hard in my small, low volume store. however, there was the issue of valentines day. that year they were promoting all these different corsets and lingerie, as well as the get in our pants campaign for the skinny jeans. management wanted the employees to try and show the corsets not just as lingerie, but as fashion items, maybe paired with the skinny jeans. increase sales and all. so there i am, valentines day, in a black corset and tight black skinny jeans and boots. waaay more sexy than 18-year old me with a still-developing body was comfortable with. in comes creepy mccreeper, a 50+ something dude who says he wants to buy something for his wife, but wants some help picking it out. not once did his eyes look at my face. the entire time im helping him, hes staring at my ass or chest and making weird comments about how i remind him of his daughter, or being uncomfortably comfortable telling me explicit details about his wifes body. he then asks me to try it on and show him, so he could see how it would look on his wife. luckily, shy 18-year old me awkwardly laughed it off and got him past the register and out of the store. i loved that job but jesus, did it draw some weirdos.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	"maybe not so much horror, but just terribly annoying/cringy. 1. i was wearing a hellblazer shirt that had a cover of the new 52 revamp on it. i had two neckbeards come up and start trying to gatekeep me on if i was ""really"" a fan of hellblazer/john constantine. it included the actual questions of ""well, what's your favorite arc?"" ""who is your favorite writer/artist?"" 2. halloween is coming up. it's the halloween season after suicide squad came out, so we have both versions of the joker's outfits (the other from the dark knight). both versions were unreasonably expensive. in total for the dark knight costume, if i remember correctly was about $200 all together. because you had to buy the coat, the undershirt, the pants etc. the fabric of the costume was just a little bit better quality then the $50 version you get at any halloween setup store. we had a guy come in about 30 minutes before we closed for the night and wanted to try on the dark knight version of the joker's outfit. the costume was hanging up on the tallest rack so it required me getting a pole and pulling down each one because the size he needed was a large and each component of the costume. he tried it on, enjoyed it, and wanted to buy it. i went ahead to go ring him up and then when he saw the price of it he started flipping out. he started complaining that he could find this costume in anywhere else that he wanted at a cheaper price. he wanted to know if there's any coupons or if i could give him my employee discount. i told him there's no way i could do that. he starts flipping out and says he needs his costume tomorrow and he doesn't have that money now. he took me about 45 minutes after closing to finally leave. he did not buy the costume. even before suicide squad came out working halloween around hot topic was always cringey with all the joker and harley quinn people. edited to correct minor errors - was using speech to text to tell the story while feeding the baby. sorry!"

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	finally one of these where i have an actual personal story. i worked at one for about a year. you would see a lot of cringy stuff just because of the base it attracts, but nothing terrible horrible usually besides one time. i was working a saturday afternoon shift, it was about 3:30 pm and the store wasnt busy at all. there were only two weaboo looking guys in their 20s in the store. then, a group of four teens walked in giggling and looking suspicious. they go up to the weaboos and start singing the nyan cat song nyannyanyannyanyannyanyanyannyanyanyan!!!! me and my coworker are like what the fuck. one of the weaboos gets aggressive and is like step the fuck back! step the fuck back! he then fucking grabs a chain wallet and starts swinging it at them. i call security and my coworker is just screaming hey hey hey!!! trying to stop it. one of the kids calls the weaboos fat asses as hes still trying to hit them with the wallet, and responds to their insult by calling them daddys cum stain bitch asses. by now 3 security guards come in and break it up, while the silent weaboo is saying the kids started it. both parties are escorted out different exits while we give a report on what happened. never saw any of them again.

[SEP]	"worked at one seasonally for about 6 years through high school and college. absolutely loved working there. we had a customer come in who claimed he was a vampire. he dressed like an extra from interview with the vampire on a tight budget and went out of his way to insist that he was truly a vampire. he would occasionally corner employees to berate them about this. it happened to me while i was helping him find a new pair of boots. he cornered me by the changing rooms, told me all about the women he enthralls, and spoke in metaphors at me for about 15 minutes. i tried to be as polite as possible and feigned interest, but eventually he must have noticed i wasn't falling prey to his glamor so he switched to complaining about how he has two different sized feet and finding footwear is hard. outside of customers, we once had an absolute idiot as a manager. dude would come in and fall asleep on the tables in the stock room, or spend hours at a time in the bathroom and have us tell anyone looking for him that he's on a conference call. he'd also occasionally try to find ways to get mos'd merch out to his car. once, back when we had a cd changer for the in-store music, he brought in a bunch of cds from his car to play. one was blink-182's take off your pants and jacket. none of the album's he brought in we're censored, which we didn't actually think about until the intro the the bonus track ""fuck a dog"" came on. the store was pretty full, we both panicked, and i ended up jumping over the counter to get to the cd changer in time to hit skip. my toe caught the counter on my way over, throwing me off balance and causing me to drill my other foot toes-first into the floor. still skipped before anyone knew what was playing, though. edit: typo"	[SEP]	170

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	oh man its my time to shine. i worked at hot topic for 4 years, so i have several. 1. this one happened when they first released their jean brand. they had sent us all sorts of signage for the promo sale and were holding a store contest among the districts for who could sell the most jeans for the month, i dont remember what the prize was but my manager was really determined to win so he made it so we all had to wear the jeans during our shift, ok fine not a problem, the catch was he picked them out and he always chose super skinny tight ones (all of us employees were underage girls, oldest being 18) and on top of that he made stickers and buttons for the promotion on his own dime, that said : ask me how to get into my pants! :| you can imagine how that turned out. 2. had a chick straight up take a shit in the dressing room. our store is one of the smallest, and theres never a point at which someone could be out of your sight and there was only one dressing room so i knew exactly who did it. i let her in to try on halloween costumes and noticed she didnt bring anything out with her, so as per protocol i went in to see if the merchandise was in there and i walked into a huge pile of shit smeared all over the merchandise and mirror/walls. it was fucking gross. my manager tried to make me clean it up. we couldnt even really do anything about it either. we asked her about it and she insisted she didnt do it. 3. a couple and their baby came in one day, it was a busy day, but i recognized the chick because she was a well known local stripper who would frequently come in an hour before closing and spend hundreds of dollars on random shit while she was strung out and then try to return it- clearly worn and used- a few days later. anyways this time, she was there with her boyfriend (im assuming) and they were walking around arguing and fighting about something. she ended up leaving and shortly after he followed. not too long after that the store is empty and i start hearing a baby. sure enough, these people left their infant in his car seat on the damn floor. we called the police obviously, but they returned not long after that for the baby.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i actually have mostly good stories about the time i worked at ht. i took the position as an asm when i was between jobs and ended up staying almost three years. one thing i havent seen mentioned often in this thread is how many strippers shop at ht. its like a one stop shop for dancers. we sold body glitter, scented body spray, decent makeup in non traditional colors, crazy platforms and spike heels, a ton of lingerie at a relatively cheap price, accessories, body jewelry, cheap hair dye, and colored wigs/hair extensions. i absolutely could not tell you how many of my regulars were local dancers, maybe 50? lets just say whatever bank teller processed our cash deposits probably wondered why so many of the one and five dollar bills sparkled and smelled like cotton candy. the sm when i was hired was a woman, and she seemed to favor hiring other women, so most of my staff was girls. i did have a few male sales associates, and b was my favorite. he was a straight edge christian metalcore kid fresh out of high school and obsessed with girls. he was a good kid, and i would always try to schedule us together, because he was genuinely nice and great at customer service, he was a hard worker, and we would talk about girls, music, and video games while we worked. one day, these two dancers come in together, and lets just say they are on. most of the dancers who came in would be in sweats and sunglasses, carrying an iced coffee, like the exact opposite of what they were by night. super low key. not these two. they were dressed super provocatively, and when i approached to help them, they immediately made it apparent they were there to put on a little show and tease the guys at ht. girls flirt with you at ht, not constantly but waaaaay more than other traditional retail, but this was way beyond that. one of the girls asked the second if her ass was too fat to fit in the skinny jeans she had picked out, to which the second responded with some lewd remark about not wearing pants at all and slapping the first girl on the butt. they asked to get into the body jewelry case to see some pieces, which requires a key and supervision. as soon as they asked, i called for b, chucked him my keys, and told the girls, i have to go to my break, but b here will be more than happy to see to your every need, at which point i walked my ass out and sat down on the bench directly in front of our store to watch the show. i have never seen human flesh turn that shade of red in my entire life. b stood there talking to these girls with this look on his face that could only be described as panic mixed with terror doused in teenaged hormones. from my seat, i could tell the girls immediately picked up on it. they started stroking his arm while speaking to him. one of them held up some lingerie against her body and looked at him as if to ask him what he thought. i was having the time of my life. 15 minutes later, i decide to put b out of his misery and walk back in. the girls decide they have what they need and approach the register. b steps up to the register. the two of them start to do this bit where theyre fighting over who gets to pay for their purchase. each of them asks b to take their debit card. no, no, i insist! finally, b just snags the closest card and runs it. the loser of the game turns to the other girl, who just paid for their purchases, and says, well, i guess i have to thank you proper, and proceeds to shove her tongue in her friends mouth. now ive been around the block and seen some shit, but at this point even i was put back on my heels a bit. but b, his eyes were so wide he looked like a cartoon character and his mouth was wide fucking open. gathering myself, i was just about to gently ask the girls to kindly not in my family establishment when they stopped, turned to b, and blew him kisses with winks. they left and i fucking lost it. i couldnt stop laughing or grinning the rest of the night. poor b couldnt think straight the rest of the shift and just wandered around in a daze until we left for the night.

[SEP]	tldr at the bottom, lmao this got way longer than i thought it would be. so theres a certain amount of dealing with creeps that i feel like most ppl go through as retail employees, but at my store we have a customer that we all know as the hot topic predator. my first interaction with the predator was very odd. he was obviously hitting on me, and i was obviously uncomfortable. he traps you there by asking you more and more personal questions and seeming very interested in your answers, so i almost felt guilty trying to pull away from the conversation. i felt like he was a nice guy, he just didnt understand boundaries, and i have a boyfriend anyways. so i survive an uncomfortable first interaction, but he kept on coming back. he was always alone, and he never bought anything. sometimes hed try to talk to me, but id just act like i was too busy with the job to chat. then he took another victim. i was helping out a really sweet girl while he was in the store, and he trapped her in the jewelry section asking really similar things that he asked me. she didnt seem uncomfortable by it, so i wasnt too worried. they talked for probably 15 mins before she left. and then literally five minutes later he starts hitting on another girl. at this point im like really grossed out, and after the second victim finally escaped i let her know he had just gotten another girls number, and she agreed with me that it was pretty douchey of him to try for two in one night. so here i am thinking this guy literally just comes in my store to find goth gfs and im like real mad about it lmao. come on dude, go find some other breeding grounds that arent you loitering around a store bothering employees and customers. but wait it gets even weirder. i got a text from a coworker saying there was a guy talking to a girl in the store for literally over an hour, and he managed to catch him name. it wasnt the name the predator had told me, so i figured it was just someone else oddly spending that much time in hot topic. then, i catch him talking to one of my female coworkers one day, and she tells me he had given her a different name too. she got really creeped out. she let me know that she had met up with him once to talk about his small business and he was basically interviewing her, asking quite personal questions and wouldnt tell her what the business was?????? so now weve gone from your average overly friendly dude, to please stop hitting on girls in my store, to this guy is definitely hiding something and i never want him stepping foot in my store again. and that was the last ive seen of the hot topic predator, but im sure hell come back, and you know damn well ill be kicking him out when he does. tldr: a customer went from annoying guy that hits on every girl in hot topic to this guys hiding something and im very worried by giving us all different names and interviewing a coworker of mine for his business, but wouldnt tell her what his business was.

[SEP]	one i can actually answer! i worked there for a short time over christmas as a second job to earn extra cash. hours were shit though, maybe 15 hours a week split into 3 shifts. anyways, the first one was when i was helping someone grab something off the bottom shelf. an older man and his still too old to be shopping at hot topic son were cashing out after i finished helping them. super rude, music snobs who hates everything but the classic rock shirts we sold. as i was bent over grabbing something for an older woman, the older man walks by on his way out, points to my ass and says thats what i want for christmas! while him and his 40 years old son leave laughing. i almost cried. secondly was the insane amount of girls coming in for billie eilish stuff. this was before she was super big so i didnt know who they were talking about. i got some of the worst death glares from those 15 year olds i ever have working in retail.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	yes! my time to chime in! ill never forget this because it still disgusts me to this day. this chick (i went to high school with her) tried to return a tongue piercing. its against company policy not to accept piercings back if the package has been opened, for very obvious health reasons. i could tell straight from the get go that the packing had been opened and i flat out asked her have you worn these? she answered yes. and got immediately defensive when i wouldnt take them back. after calmly explaining the company policy multiple times, i finally said would you wanna wear a complete strangers used tongue piercing in your mouth?! she huffed and left and 7 years later i catch myself wondering about her one brain cell.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	so i have too many great stories. one of my favorites is there was a time this older lady came up to me and asked excuse me sir, is there any way you could help my granddaughter get into the fitting room, shes apparently too afraid to ask anyone in here for help. and the girl, maybe 14 or 15 just screams its called social anxiety!! then throws the stuff she had in her hands in the air and runs out of the store. the grandmother just rolled her eyes apologized, and slowly walked out.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	so its boxing day, right? (like black friday, but its the day after christmas) and this lady is getting so upset that she cant get a better deal on some graphic tees (the deal was $15 tees instead of the usual deal which was buy 2 get 1 free) she wanted both deals, and the cashier was explaining to her how deals werent combinable. so my manager stepped in to try and explain it. she starts yelling and getting so angry. a customer behind her pipes up and said something along the lines of why are you being so difficult? im sure theyre (us staff) having a hard enough day, so just let it go. and that first customer did not want to hear that, and she turned around and decked the other woman. it turned into a full blown fist fight, and mall security had to be called.

[SEP]	"fuck i finally have a perfect response and this post is 11 hours old!!! well if anyone is still here, in 2008 i was assistant manager at hot topic. the manager hired me because we had flirted at my old job and he asked me to come work at his store and i hated my current job at lime grill. so i said fuck it and went to go work for him. he would always hit on me at the store. i was 20 yes old. i didnt really entertain it but we were cool, plus he seemed to hit on every girl that would walk in there. on friday nights he'd hang around the store and the employees and i would joke about how he'd seem to be flirting with underage girls but we also didnt think much of it because that was his personality. he was short, covered in tats, and actually pretty cute so the little teenage emo girls would come in just to see the ""hot hot topic guy"". he'd entertain them like it was fun for him to have little fans. he was 34 yes old but could pass for a highschooler if it werent for the tats all over his arms and neck. fast forward 2 months into my job and he was arrested. at a hotel. with a 12 yr old girl that he met at the store. she apprently got scared, backed out, and called her mom to come get her. good job manny you fucking creepy fuck bag. aventura mall, aventure fl for reference. his name was manny if you wanna look up the new stories."

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	someone once left a live chicken in our dressing room. how they got it in the mall itself remained a mystery for the entire time i worked there. we also had someone shove a piece of pizza between our folded shirts. but i also had a weird hold over the juggalo kids and would sell them that powdered sour sugar that come in tubes and have them snort lines of it for my amusement because i was a monster.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i doubt i will see the story here but i was probably part of a horror story for an employee. though really it probably was just a minor annoyance. my mom took me into hot topic because i was an edgy teen. it was the only place that had clothes that made me feel good about myself (like i actually felt like i looked good in them, especially with a bobbed haircut). well for whatever reason my mom decided she didnt like me wearing dark clothes with the cute little skulls and silly characters on them. she proceeded to make fun of me and call me a dyke (which turned out to a nickname for me amongst her friends) really loudly in the store. i just kept ignoring her and saying, well idc i like them the whole time. finally the cashier apparently had enough and told my mom to please shut up, he didnt like hearing her talk to me like that. if she *really* didnt like being in the store to just please leave. my mom ended up having a fit about him talking to her like that, he is just a child, how dare he talk to her like that, what does he know about raising a child. it was so embarrassing and i had to leave without new clothes. it sticks with me cause that was the year of school where i ended up wearing huge hoodies to hide the clothes that barely fit cause my mom didnt want to accept me liking hot topic	[SEP]	48
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	yes finally a question i'm an expert in answering!! i started as a seasonal employee and made my way up to assistant store manager. worked there for a little over 5 years, too! (would have been store manager but i decided to switch to something with holidays off, lol yay banking.iregreteverything.) anyway. * most customers were *really* awesome, even parents of kids just coming in for the holidays. but of course we had some strange birds, what retail store doesn't?! this is my fav story, and though horror, it is still wholesome ;) i had one customer who was looking for earrings for her son. i was showing her different kinds of earrings and smaller gauged plugs, explaining the process of stretching. in the middle of this, she calls her son over and asks him to show me his ears - *that he pops off his head and hands to me b/c they are prosthetic ears!!* inside i freaked the f*ck out b/c i wasn't expecting that, but i somehow managed to keep it together and ended up not only making the sale but also helping that little boy feel better about himself; he said that having a real earring would help make his ears look more real. at the end of the entire thing there was a tear in my eye. * had a customer who called and told me a story about how there was another worker there who, when she would bend over, he could see her thong and he said he made a joke to her about it but felt really bad and he wanted to apologize so if he could just have that girl call him so he could say he was sorry. told my store manager about that one before i talked to the person i thought he may have meant and turns out this weirdo was calling all the stores saying the same thing. * had a customer who wanted a couple of the women employees to try on shoes for him so he could pick something out for his wife. he was aroused. (but i mean hey he bought a couple pairs soooo win? idk.) * had a customer who would come in every sunday to give the entire working staff a hug. * had a customer who would come in every couple of weeks and ask if we had kermit the frog merchandise. (wow this list is getting long, lol. but man i used to love this job so much.)	[SEP]	90

""one time i was literally just folding shirts at the front of the store, the side that faces out toward the mall and and some white woman in her 40s just screamed and then i looked at her and she did the sign of the cross at me one time i had a juggalo, in full clown paint, pay me for a t shirt in quarters a brony got pissed at me because we didn't have some sort of rainbow dash key chain or some stupid shit like that a lady called the store to ask about hair dye. she wanted purple and we had a lot of different ones. so i told her we had royal purple, lavender etc. and she asked me to describe the colors in depth to her over the phone and she got pissed at me because she couldn't visual what it looked like and then asked me what it would look like if she put it in her brown hair without bleaching it and i told her it wouldn't turn out and she got even more mad"""	[SEP]	89
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	"wow this question was made for me! i've worked in hot topic for 3 years! i'm 8 time employee of the month and really well liked by most customers at my location, so much so that i'll be eating in the food court and people will come up to me and ask if i'm the hot topic girl. anyways, one day i was working a shift with one of the assistant store managers. it was an incredibly slow day and we were just tidying up the store while chatting about our pets. since there wasn't much to do, my boss thought it was a perfect time for a break, so i had the floor to myself. our location is small and usually this is fun for me because i get to help all customers that come in. however right as he leaves, we have the nastiest, rudest two women come in. they charge right up to me and begin screaming at me in a chinese language, i'm unsure if it was mandarin or cantonese. note, i'm half japanese half white but people often think i'm just white. so cut back to the story, these two women are screaming at me. i calmly tell them i have no idea what they're trying to tell me as i only speak english and the tiniest bit of french. the one woman just starts shouting return as close to my face as possible. so i ask for her receipt. no receipt. if they don't have a receipt we have to ask if they have a points account so we can see previous purchases and make sure they did buy this shirt within the last 30 days. so i ask if they have a phone number or email with us. one is still screaming in her language at me and the other woman says i'm trying to steal her information. i explain that i just want to see when the shirt was purchased. the absolutely no english speaking woman pulled a different receipt from her purse and shoved it into my hands. the shirt in question wasn't even on the receipt and the receipt was from october, this happened in february. i explain this to them and say they have 30 days, not multiple months and the woman decides to say i don't know how the store works and she's done it before. i decide to at least take a look at the shirt she was trying to return. it was a pickle rick shirt that had no tag, not one but multiple stains on it and was oddly warm. i explained it needs to be unwashed, unworn and have the tags still on it to be able to be returned and the woman says ""yeah, no washed,"" as if i couldn't tell from all the stains. i tell them i won't be doing the return as if i had returned it i'd get some serious questioning from the store manager and the asm's. they leave and come back in about 10 minutes. right after the asm comes back from his break. they begin to scream at him in their language too. he is white, doesn't look remotely asian at all so at this point we were both kind of like, ""what the heck?"" i explain to him the situation and he agrees that we can't return the shirt. the woman then smacks me with the receipt she had and begins screaming in my face in her language. the other woman says we are too rude, and should be fired. i decide enough's enough and we'll call security. i'm waiting for them to pick up and my boss says, let's just do the return. then he retracts that idea once he sees the shirt. it was honestly gross. so he explains that the shirt needs to be unworn, unwashed and have the tags still on, the woman again says it wasn't washed. the other woman who spoke no english shoves my boss and screams more. my boss is the nicest person. like people are rude to him all the time and he still gives them service with a smile but will tell us his tale of woe afterwards. so he just kindly refuses to do their transaction. at this point i call security again but nobody was answering the phone. so we ask them to leave the store. they do, surprisingly. then, maybe 5 minutes later, they come back with a woman from michael hill, a fancy jewelry store who basically was trying to act as their translator with some obviously made up story that they were vacationing in canada and there was no way she could be bought the shirt in october because they had only been there a week. i asked how she had a receipt from our location from october and she ignored my question and just argued with the store manager over the return in question. after guilt tripping him and offering him a discount on rings if he ever needed one, she convinced him to do the return. at this point i walked away from the cash because we had other customers. as i was talking to one of our regulars, they were leaving. the one woman who didn't speak a word of english pushed me on her way out. had i not been at work, i seriously would've considered punching her. but this customer, who happens to think i'm one of the kindest and most helpful associates we have, gets fired up from this and begins telling them how rude it was and how they can't go around shoving people. the make the rude blah blah blah hand motion to him and smirk at me. nice customer feels badly for me and says he doesn't know how i deal with stuff like that. nice customer also tells customer service about what happened and that i'm great so if there's any complaints he wants to cancel them out. luckily there was no complaint but i'd be happy if i never saw those woman again."

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	my first job was at a hot topic in a dying mall. i was 16. one of the worst parts of the job was folding t-shirts. it seemed like every person who touched a t-shirt would ball it up and throw it somewhere out of place. i probably folded thousands of t-shirts. but whatever, just part of the job. i started there when they first began their rewards program. my manager was always on my ass trying to get me to sell this membership. nobody wanted a damn membership, or maybe i was a bad salesman, but either way, i rarely signed anyone up. this was reflected on the weekly report sent to the district manager, and i even got written up over it. i started working there because i loved music, and their album rack was always down my alley. they're a musically oriented company, so they had this sound system integrated with a central server that played a selection of maybe 10 songs, to be updated every month. well it didn't update for close to 3 months. every day i would hear the same songs 5 or 6 times over, for months, and it *drove me insane*. to this day i still get burnt out on music faster than anyone i know. during my breaks i would hang out in the run down, barely open mall and grab a bite at the auntie ann's. their pizza pretzel was my shit, and the cute cashier would hook me up with free marinara. we would flirt and chat all the time. i eventually got her number, i texted her (with my flip motorola) and we planned to hang out. i had my older friend buy me a four loco, when they still had caffeine, and i drove to her place at 10pm to pick her up. we shared the drink in the car on the way back to my house. we barely talked, unlike at the mall. very awkward. i took her to my sparsely furnished, unfinished basement and immediately we went at it. when we were done we kind of awkwardly sat there and i took her home just after midnight. from then on she would come into the hot topic to look for me and i would hide in the back while my manager covered for me. i totally ghosted her texts too. soon after i got fired for showing up hungover too many times, and i started to work at the pac sun right next door. that place is a whole other story.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	super late to this party, but i worked at ht for about 3 months. it was, and still is the worst job ive ever had. the management was just atrocious and the micromanaging was on a level i didnt know was even possible. so, i guess my horror story is just working there, with their pos system straight outa 1990. i purposely got fired by spending an entire open to close shift giving my employee discount to everyone that came in on a busy saturday though.	[SEP]	145
[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	ah yes, my time to shine. a personal favorite of mine was a weeknight that i was working alone, seeing as we didnt get a lot of customers that late unless it was a friday or saturday. i had pretty much taken care of all the organizing and cleaning up that needed done on the floor, everything that had to go out the next day was out. so i was just strolling around the floor looking for stuff to fold and this lady comes in. she looked young but i honestly thought she was older than me (i was 19 at the time). she strikes up a conversation with me almost immediately and i rattle off my retail manager jargon, asking if i can help her find anything and letting her know the sales. after she looks around for a minute, she asks if we sell any nipple rings. we did have a few, so i told her yes and opened up the cabinet that held that particular style of body jewelry. the rule was that we had to stand with the customer and be near them when those cases were open so they didnt steal. as she looked, she asked me to get down with her and look give my opinions on what she was looking at. i felt a little awkward, and honestly i thought nipple rings were a little much, but i tried my best to be friendly and told her yeah, that ones cool. and let her know we had more on our clearance shelves. eventually, while she was looking, she decided to dive into the story of how she got it, and how she thought the size of her current piercing was different than it should be. i nodded along and said whatever oh, dang. or yeeeah. it whatever to make sure she didnt think i was ignoring her. then she asked me if i wanted to see it. oh, no thank you. i believe you no, no, really! [her current ring] looks bigger than it should be. thats weird, but no you dont have to show me. she accepts is and moves on to looking at hair dye. now, she asks me to join her in sitting on the floor and seeing what hair color she should get. i obliged her until more customers finally came in (thank god), but before that happened, she once again asked me if i wanted to see her nipple piercing. again, i declined. she acted like i was missing out on something. oh yeah, and i also had a pair of 40-yr. old moms come in and flirt with me at the register when they checked out. one asked if they could take me and get me a drink for being so helpful and i told her no, im too young. and she said no one needs to know!, so i told her i was a straightedge, she asked if that included sex, and mentioned her friend was interested before they left. what a store.

[CLS]	hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	[SEP]	i know im late to the game and no one will see this but i worked at hot topic for a year, these are my experiences. white teenage girls yelling at the top of their lungs at there parents about something and dropping all of the curse words; we tell them to leave because familys are around and they look at you like wtf. teenagers coming in asking for razors to cut themself with and then laughing with their friends; no joke that happened twice. during the time, 2006, everyone buying misfits shirts and then look at you weird when you ask them their favorite song buy them; mine still is last caress. people stealing shit. fun fact, if youre a girl, put your stolen stuff in your purse because staff cant look in there. i have learned that people forget how to fold a shirt when they try to put a shirt back and just shut it into the shirt stack. working the christmas holidays suck because it takes over an hour or two to put everything in the store back when youre closing. lastly, this isnt bad but when i worked there, they had the biggest storage of mp3s i had seen at that time. millions of songs to choose from when working and that was pretty cool. nothing to crazy but that was my experience with working at hot topic.

[SEP]	i was a young software engineer working for a startup in 1998. wrote about a weeks worth of code, images, and html. there was this funny file named ?~ in the directory. i wasnt sure how it got there, but i wanted it gone before i checked everything into cvs. no problem. rm-rf ?*. i discovered my error a few seconds later when the directory listing contained nothing. no code, images, or html. turns out ? is a shell wildcard character matching any 1 character. combined with * all files got deleted. it was at this moment i knew i fucked up. luckily i was using linux. e2fs file systems had a utility called debugfs which allowed me to list deleted inodes and dump them to new files. took the better part of a day to figure it all out since this was before google. i recovered the entire project.

[CLS]	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	[SEP]	new year's eve 1999 i called a woman i was very good friends with (friends only, i was firmly in the friend zone at that time), she was also my boss. i had way too much to drink and was not in any way considered sober or even slightly so, i was pissed as a fart. i proceeded to tell this woman how i felt about her, what i wished to do with her and how i wanted to do it. i told her this for about 45 minutes. afterwards i continued to drink. several days later back at work she calls me into the office and asked me why i'd called her at new year, i pulled a blank, i honestly could not remember a thing. she also informed me that several minutes into the conversation/monologue she handed the phone over to her mother. i still pulled a blank, in fact i was so convinced that nothing happened i was sure she was winding me up. if anything like that had happened after all why was she still even talking to me let alone letting me continue to work with her. she insisted that i called and i refused to believe her. it was not until late january when i received my detailed mobile phone bill that showed a 48 minute phone call to her number late on december 31 that i finally had to believe her. the difficult part was facing her mother after my boss and i became an item. we are now very happily married but even now my mil still takes the piss out of me over that phone call. my wife however is very happy. edit- when this message was posted it was the 69th post on this thread - coincidence?

[SEP]	"a female friend of mine  to whom i was admittedly attracted  had been expressing her reservations about an upcoming vacation with her family. though it wasn't being overtly presented as such, the trip was meant as a way of re-solidifying her parents' marriage, which had been a touch rocky at the time. they would all be driving from san francisco to redding (which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere in northern california), where they'd stay at a bed-and-breakfast inn for a weekend before continuing northward for some unknown destination. in keeping with the alleged purpose of this so-called vacation, two rooms had been booked at the inn in question. to her dismay, though, my friend discovered that her mother would be occupying one room, her father would have the other, and that she and her sister would each have to bunk with one of their parents. this was worthy of lament on its own, but it was made unforgivably worse by the verbal diarrhea that i offered in an attempt at providing comfort: ""aw, it won't be so bad!"" i told my friend. ""your father will probably enjoy sleeping with you."" a moment passed before i realized what i had said. then, with a feeling of growing horror, i tried to explain myself. ""wait, i didn't mean it like that!"" i hurriedly said.

[SEP]	so about three years ago, my dad, my dad's girlfriend, my brother and i went cycling around this lake like we do so often. my brother (15 at that time) and i (11 back then) decided to make a race with the finish being a parking lot. at the end of this parking lot was a barrier right before a bridge. it rained that day in the morning and obviously, my brother won by far but i was still going at - what for my age was - a high speed. when i finally got to the finish, i had to slow down, but my bike just wouldn't. that's when i knew i fucked up real bad. i ended up crashing into that barrier and hanging over that shit afterwards. my brother describes this story as so unbelievably funny because my bike was just small enough to fit under the barrier and so it drove on like 10ft, leaving me behind hanging on the barrier. well i hope i made your day a bit better. also, my english isn't perfect, i know. i'm not a native speaker.

[CLS]	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	[SEP]	more years ago than i can quite believe (until i catch a glimpse of my grey hair in the mirror) was the last time i drove drunk. it was a summer lunchtime and a handful of us had been partying for several days at a friends (parents) house. i was *wasted*, as was everyone else - so when a female friend turned up in her brand new 4x4 and promptly fell asleep the obvious course of action was for us to borrow the vehicle for a joyride around the lanes of somerset. this was, actually, pretty anomalous for us - drink-driving was always heavily frowned upon - but clearly under the influence of anything and everything it all seemed to make perfect sense. for the next while - i was far too pissed to know how much time was passing - we took turns speeding round the roads in what was effectively a stolen car, drinking and getting (even more) high. my turn came last and everyone was joking about our good fortune running out and us getting nicked/dying in a fiery crash (ha. ha. ha.) - especially with me behind the wheel, as we were quite close to the spot where id been a passenger in a crash the previous year. which was thoroughly reassuring. i settled in and started tearing up the lanes - cant remember what the vehicle was but it was great fun to hoon round in (and a bit different: automatics arent especially common in the uk) - and put on the prodigy for the ideal soundtrack. turning the corner i saw that we were at the start of a long straight (an old roman road leading to glastonbury) ideal for just flooring it - so thats what i did. at the end of the straight i made the turn with, i think, two wheels ever-so-slightly leaving the ground - and ill never forget the definitely discernible shift of mood that caused in all of us, like yeah ok that was a little close. its time to stop this. - just before i saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and my whole world got ready to go down the shitter. i had no idea how long theyd been behind us but even if it was very recent thing they would just have seen us taking the last corner on two wheels. at god knows how much over the speed limit. in a stolen car. very drunk. very high. with no licence, nor insurance. and pockets full of drugs. until then id always thought my blood turned to ice was nonsense but at that instant i understood: i really felt frozen. the car went immediately silent (apart from the siren which we could now hear) as i killed the stereo, trying not to panic, just thinking over and over: im fucked. this is it. im really, truly, totally fucked - and everyone else in the car thinking: hes fucked. totally fucked. thank god its not me. there was nowhere to pull in for what felt like miles so i had plenty of time to dwell on my imminent destruction, and to weigh up the pros and cons of trying to escape them (which wouldnt have happened anyway in that car). outwardly i was totally dispassionate and calm (to the extent that later one of my friends said hed decided i was either a psychopath or a terminator) but internally i was screaming, sobbing and already trying to guess how many years inside i was looking at. finally i saw a place to pull in, and put my indicator on like pulling back the hammer on my suicide. i took a deep breath, made the turn - and the police car just steered wide and sped past us. the lights were to get us to pull over, sure - but only to get out of the way. theyd received a different call. ive never driven drunk again.

[SEP]	"ive posted this in on reddit before, figured i'd put it here because its one of my favorite stories and it fits. so, my junior year of high school, i was taking a class called ""sci-fi and fantasy"". predictably we read books of said genre. we did readers theater (each person in the class gets assigned a character on a voluntary basis, anytime the character says something, the assigned person would say it aloud, the teacher was the narrator, and roleplay was involved if you choose to) on a couple books, one being ""the hobbit"" by jrr tolkien. so in this chapter of the book, my character, thorin, had maybe one or two lines so i was bored. this was the chapter where the eagles swoop down and save the day from the orcs. as the group was saying goodbye (i forget how the book actually goes in this part to the specifics, please forgive me) to the eagles, my teacher stops and asks the group, ""anyone wanna like to do the eagle part?"" gazes around the entire class and does a double take at me (i'm a fairly outgoing person, especially in that class with roleplaying) so i'm like ""f*ck it. why not right??"" and out of the silence, with zero warning to anyone, i just scream ""cccaaaaaaaaaawwwwwww!"" and did the best eagle screech i could do (it was pretty spectacular, especially for being very much on a whim). everyone stops and looks at each other. now its dead silent. nobody knows what to do, or how to react. so my teacher, pipes up after 5 seconds of pure silence ""ok. does anyone wanna do the actual eagle part?"" apparently they had actual lines where they say things."

""hey the-go-kid, what's happening there!?"" screamed my friend's wife. a moment or two later i realised what was happening. there was a 3-foot flame protruding from the gas canister. like a mini-flamethrower. the rubber seal had corroded from the time it had spent not being particularly well stored in the winter, and with the canister being heavily used, it had decided to go full ellen ripley on me. there were around 20-25 adults and 10 kids in the very small garden at this point, so i figured, i need to evacuate. we managed to get everyone out of the way, and i ran upstairs to get my tiny fire extinguisher. i exhausted this thing on the canister, but it was so hot the flames flared up again. fortunately for me, my garden backed onto the fire brigade's premises, and within 2-3 minutes, the professionals were there and spraying all my food in foam. they were happy to take the canister away, saying it needed to be cooled for an hour or two and they would do so while drinking a cup of tea. it was all fairly funny in hindsight, [but it was soon overshadowed by what happened a few months later.](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9f5zu8/tifu_by_moving_in_next_door_to_a_drug_dealer/)"	[SEP]	335

[CLS]	what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	[SEP]	when i was 7 my parents left me and my sister ( who was 10 at the time ) home with a baby sitter who lived 3 houses down. it was in the morning and my sister had just woken up and wanted cereal but i had the last bit of milk . her being the petty person she is , decides to eat the cereal dry causing me to feel bad so i went into the kitchen and put coco powder in a plastic cup ( no liquid mixed with the powder ) then i placed the cup in the microwave for 15 mins in hope of melting the coco powder so my sister could put it on top of her cereal . as if on queue my baby sitter left to go grab something for her house and she left my sister in charge . fast forward 5-7 mins and the whole kitchen was full of smoke , **the cup was on fire and the fire alarm was blazing the roof off and i was crying niagara falls. i knew i had fucked up big time** . my sister attempts to solve the situation by telling me to fan the fire alarm with a cloth as she opens the windows and dashes water into the microwave ( note that the fire was small but was big enough for water to not be able to distinguish it ). enter baby sister who's now dumbfounded to how i was able to set the microwave on fire during her 6 minute absence , who now calls the fire brigade and my parents to alert them of the fire. lets just say my parents didn't take it so well but on the plus side a firefighter correctly melted some of the coco powder for my sister ( before my parents arrived ) all whilst dying of laughter .

[CLS]	doctor strange predicted 14,000,605 different outcomes for the infinity war. what's one of the dumbest/weirdest outcomes he saw?	[SEP]	instead of destroying half of all life (as in 50% of living things) , one half of every creature disappears, as in one half a human (say the right half), and this happens to everybody, since almost no creature can survive with just one half, about 97% of living things die (including thanos). the creatures that do make it, start another more advanced and peaceful civilizations full of half-creatures like them, and everything in day-to-day life becomes based on half, one half toilets, one half teleporters, etc. this civilization grows and prospers, but gets destroyed one a thanos-like person, one with the same intentions, decides to wipe out half of all life in the universe to save resources and make everybody rich, and accidentally destroys the remaining one-half of all living things. thus ending all life in the universe. tl;dr: one-half of every creatures body is destroyed, some time later, somebody does this again and kills the remaining one-half of peoples bodies,everybody dies.

[CLS]	"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	[SEP]	just last month, a friend of mine told me a story from his recent heartbreak. he (lets call him mickey) had been with this girl (minnie) for almost 4 years when out of nowhere, she told him she is leaving him and moving out. he had no idea the relationship was in jeopardy, but she dipped. anyway, a few weeks go by. mickey is hanging out with a coworker of his with who he had just recently met and ends up back at his place just to hang out. on the fridge, he sees a note in minnies handwriting. the note detailed several issues in mickey and minnies relationship and so mickey asks his new friend where he found this note. turns out, this new buddy had gone to the same music festival as mickey and minnie a few months prior. the friend had found the note on the ground of the parking lot and thought wow, what a sad and angry note. im going to keep this because its so raw and interesting. the next day, minnie came over to pick up some of her things. mickey produced the note and it led to a long tear-filled conversation about their relationship and what went wrong. they didnt end up back together, because despite the pseudonyms, this is no disney story. however, the resulting discussion helped them both achieve closure in a meaningful way. all because a random coworker found and kept her discarded note in a festival parking lot. edit: a bunch of you are saying minnie was hooking up with the coworker but i can assure you that was not the case. mickey and minnie had never even met the coworker, as mickey and the coworker both work jobs for a massive company and had never crossed paths until well after minnie left. mickey and him had just become friends days after the breakup. as for why he kept the note, hes just that kind of guy. he was moved by the content of the note so he kept it. they werent having an affair or anything - and if they were, thatd be well over because minnie moved to another city the same week she left mickey. dont be too cynical folks. sometimes things just dont work out. edit 2: and for those thinking mickey is partly at fault for the relationship ending and being oblivious to the reasons for her sudden leaving. of course he is. and he recognizes this. he recognizes his role in the situation and doesnt hate her or anything. he just wants her to be happy and is heartbroken over both of their failures in making that happen. hes a good guy, and hes learning. edit 3: for people saying i am in fact mickey, i am not haha im happily married for one year and you could probably comb through my other comments to prove it if you really wanted but that would be boring. however, if you prefer the narrative that i am mickey, far be it from me to dissuade you.

[SEP]	when i was at college, i had this buddy who i used to give a ride to and from the campus each day because we lived a couple of streets apart. one morning ive got goldfinger (the ska band, not the bond movie) playing on my cd player in my car. hed never heard them before, really dug it and asked me about them. it was the day before easter break and he was like cool, ill check them out. cut to two weeks later, hes telling me how he has bought all their records, got his long-distance girlfriend into them when he visited her and has basically listened to nothing but them since we spoke about it. i feel good for helping a buddy discover his new favourite band, but think nothing more of it. that summer me and this dude have a falling out (long story, but the tl;dr is that he screwed me out of nearly 1000) and a bit later, i stop seeing him around. after a while a mutual friend tells me hes dropped out and moved away. the next summer, a friend of mine asks me if i want a ticket to see reel big fish that evening. his sister was supposed to go but is really sick and cant. i say sure and tag along. we get there and it turns out the support band is goldfinger, which is pretty cool. so were standing there, having a beer in between bands and i clumsily knock some girl who is walking pasts drink out of her hand. i turn and apologise and offer to buy her a replacement. while were waiting the bar we get to talking and were getting on pretty well. me and my friend end up hanging out with her and her sisters the whole night, having a great time and me and this girl end up exchanging numbers. cut forward again a couple of years. me and said girl have been together basically since that night. were moving in together and its going really great. the night we move in together, were sitting amongst all our boxes of shit on the only seats that are unpacked and i say something like; imagine if i hadnt taken [friends] offer to go to that rbf show that night. wed never have met shes then like not only that, imagine if you hadnt bumped into me and we hadnt got to talking. our original plan that night was to leave after goldfinger played as they were the only band we were bothered about seeing i commented something about how i really liked them or something, i forget what. and then i ask how she got into them and, im paraphrasing but the long and short of it was: oh my sister got me into them. her douchebag ex-boyfriend got her into them. they were long distance while she studied in the us. they used to go to shows together when he would visit. hes actually from round here i think yup. same dude that i used to give rides to. bonus butterfly effect: my buddy who was with me at that show actually ended up marrying the sister in question last year. tldr: managed to set myself and a buddy up with serious relationships, just by introducing some random dude who i used to give a ride to school to a band that i liked. edit: to add clarity to all this, i will say that me and said girl are no longer together - this was all quite a few years ago now. we remain very close friends to this day and were respectively best man and maid of honour at my friends/her sisters wedding last year. shes married to a lovely lady from scotland and has been for 4 or so years now. theyve just adopted their first son. ive been married to my wife for nearly 2 years now. although you could even add that to the butterfly effect of it all, as it was the same girl that got me the job where i ended up meeting my wife. life is fucking weird.

[SEP]	"(obligatory) not my story, but my ex-wife's. we're still friends though. so i think this story takes place in the summer of 2003. might have been 2004, not sure, but i think it was 2003. she was up in cape cod because her grandmother had a house out in eastham. her whole family is up there visiting, her parents, some cousins, a bunch of people. one day she borrows her mom's minivan to drive into boston to meet up with a friend. she's driving back late at night, and the road is pretty deserted. all of a sudden she sees some kind of animal up on the road ahead. she's not sure but she thinks it might be a wolf. she slams on the brakes. i'm talking, shit-goes-flying kind of slam on the brakes. it's scary and chaotic and the wolf, or whatever it is, eventually runs off. she drives the rest of the way to her grandmother's house, and tries to discreetly tell her dad what happened. but the oldsters in the room have cottoned on to the fact that a secret is being shared and they all want to know what happened. eventually the story comes out. my wife's grandmother, who, god love her, would go on to live to the age of 97, responded by saying, ""that's why women shouldn't drive at night."" i found this response absolutely *hilarious* and for years i enjoyed making reference to it at inappropriate times and circumstances. anyway, everyone goes to bed and all seems well. until the next day when my ex is driving the same van back out towards boston. now, cape cod is pretty much a 1-way-on, 1-way-off kind of an island. and i forgot to mention but it's the end of a holiday weekend, i think it was the 4th of july. so traffic is really crazy. eventually she is at a standstill on the main road for so long, she puts the van in park to wait. and then when traffic moves again she can't get it back out of park. like, it just won't shift out of park, no matter what she does. she turns the car off and back on. nope. nothing. so now she has a car in murderously awful traffic, on a road that (if memory serves) only has 2 lanes to begin with, and she can't move. she can't get out of the way. she's stuck and making already bad traffic much worse. she's by the side of the road and people are driving by screaming obscenities at her. and she's thinking, ""believe me, i would *love* to fuck off right about now but this car is broken and i don't know what to do!"" so after what seems like forever, eventually these 2 guys stop to help. and they're trying to figure out what's going on. it's a really weird problem and it's taking them awhile. and the whole time, my ex is thinking, this one guy looks kind of familiar. like, she keeps eyeing him, you know. trying to figure out if she knows him. and if she does, where does she know him from. now, at this point, i'll mention the answer to the car riddle, which the 2 guys sadly never figured out. it turns out, (and i know how crazy this sounds), that the following had happened: when she stopped short for the wolf, a coin somehow got lodged in the cigarette lighter. it eventually caused a short circuit. the circuit that blew was also connected to the gear shifter. so when the short happened, she was no longer able to shift. insane. back to the 2 guys. the one guy notices my ex noticing the other guy and trying to figure out why he seems familiar. and so finally he says, ""do you watch alias?"" and that was when my ex realized that one of the guys who stopped to help her was bradley cooper. unfortunately, selfies weren't really the standard at the time that they are today, so she didn't think to include herself in the picture she took of the 2 guys. but she does have the picture of bradley cooper and his friend, the nice guys who stopped and tried to help her with her car trouble. and she didn't recognize him at all at the time, but much later she realized, from looking at the picture, that the other guy was bryan callen. so, to review, some kind of animal was hanging out in a road on cape cod one night, and as a result my ex-wife met bradley cooper and bryan callen."

[SEP]	i'm a carpenter, and my crew was remodeling a house. at this point the house had no plumbing, so if we needed do a #2, we had to drive to the nearest grocery store. lunch break roles around. i get in my truck and head off to the grocery store to take care of my 12 o'clock restroom trip after eating my lunch. on the way there, i see a guy sprinting frantically down the road. i debate on whether i ask him if he needs a ride or not because i don't want to have to drive him somewhere really far away and not have time to have a decent poop. but it wad pretty warm outside and i could tell by his attire that he wasn't running for exercise. i pull over, ask him if he is alright and if he needs a ride. without hesitation he jumps in and tells me that he was late for work because his car had broke down. he asked me to drop him off at his house (which was on the way to the grocery store) so that he could shower and change into his uniform. i told him i could wait and take him to work but he insisted that he could make it from there. a few minutes later, i arrive at the grocery store. it's a pretty small one. and the only restrooms are in the very back of the store. past a bunch of storage shelves and pallet jacks. stuff like that. but i make it there just in time, and not a second too soon. i was in one hell of a bind. so much in fact that i do the unthinkable. i shit before i checked to see if there was any toilet paper. there wasn't. minutes pass and i'm stranded in this single stall bathroom. too far away to reach the papertowels. i thought about risking it and making a dash for them, but i couldn't stand the though of somebody walking in on me in the middle of the bathroom and my pants around my ankles. there was nothing i could do but wait. to make matters worse, i was still on lunch break and needed to head back soon. finally a guy comes in. i tell him i've been stuck in here for a long time and i need toilet paper. he tells me not to worry because he'll tell somebody that works there. i worry anyways because he didn't seem to think i wad serious because he laughed at my situation. asshole. finally i get the idea to call the grocery store from the bathroom stall. i ask to speak to a manager. i tell them i've been stranded in their bathroom for 45 minutes with shit on my ass and i'm going to be late for work now. i let them know that i didn't have time to eat my lunch now. i let them know that i was angry. he apologized for the inconvience and told me that he would be there in a minute with some tp. he brought it to me and passed it under the stall door. and all was well. i exited the bathroom and find the manager. who was waiting to apologize in person. a familar face. the same guy i had given a ride back to his house. earlier. shared a laugh that because we both helped each other get to work on time the same day. bought me lunch at the stores deli.

(i was 21 at the time and really dumb). i had some savings and unemployment money so i decided to try for a career in the movie industry. i worked for free on a couple of movies and gained some set experience. well the savings ran out and i needed to get a real job, so i answered an ad on monster.com to be an assistant at a pretty large porn company, since they wanted someone with set experience and office experience. i was the assistant to the head of production, which meant i was doing most of his grunt work. booking talent, locations, crew, managing budget, etc, as well as handling distribution and fulfillment. basically, i became a porn producer. i left that company, which was straight porn, and went to work for a gay fetish wrestling porn company, where i met a guy who would introduce me to another guy who worked for digital domain. he hired me as a day player on the italian job, and in the past 16 years i've worked on 20+ major hollywood movies, including avatar, suicide squad, and aquaman. so basically if i wasn't an idiot i wouldn't have the career i have today. makes it really weird when kids ask me how i got into the movie biz.

[SEP]	"in 1999 i was in navy electronic core learning about radars. i had been in the navy for about 6 months and this was my second consecutive school learning about electronics. i met a guy i'll call sb. we became fast friends and two weeks later he failed the class we were in together. he confessed that he was just tired of all the studying and tests so i gave him my super-detailed notes to study to help him on the next test. i actually tutored several people over beers and had taught a few classes when the teacher didn't know the subject that well. i was labeled a nerd by my peers and i was damn proud of it. anyway, sb took my notes to the chief's review board and they were extremely impressed with the notes that 'he was taking' and gave him a second chance. sb and i repeated this same process four more times; the chief's review board kept giving him second chances because they believed he was truly putting in the work to be his best because of my notes. i graduate radar school and get orders to yokosuka, japan and before i leave to go to san diego to get specialized training on the sps-49 i give sb all of my notes and tell him good luck. the son-of-a-bitch passed and got orders to my ship working on another radar! we met up briefly in san diego, hung out and when he left for japan i told him to have an open tab at a bar waiting for me. his radar school specialty was shorter than mine so i met up with him three months later in japan in march of 2000. we go out drinking, i get super drunk on chu-hi's and when we get to the quarter deck he tells the officer of the deck he doesn't know me and just leaves me. my first day on the ship and i just passed out on the front door! two months later that officer of the deck is my section leader chief and it turns out he's the combat systems divisional chief and he got mad as hell when he found out sb and me were friends since school, i helped him get to the ship and he just up and abandoned me. two years later. i should have let sb fucking fail. we stayed friends but our friendship was rocky at best. he dodged work as much as possible and 'no surprise' was terrible as a technician. i was naive and helping a 'friend'. then 9/11 happened. [~~in september 2001, chancellorsville deployed with the kitty hawk battle group in support of operation enduring freedom, operating in the theater for several months.~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_chancellorsville) i was on the chancellorsville from 2000-2003 and we never went to the gulf. when 9/11 happened our ship was doing a wetdock and we had a huge hole cut in our ship to replace an engine part. the entire fleet left without us and we didn't go back to sea until at least november. it's a cowardly lie that cg-62 was in the gulf and it's not just in wiki, it's in some other navy online mags. anyway, 9/11 happened and a few days later scrubski (dude had to carry a shave chit with him because he had this beard magic where he had to shave every 5 hours due to how quickly it grew) came up to me and asked me to sign a card. when the pentagon got hit it killed his best friend from navy schools. apparently, i had roomed with scrubski and this kid for three weeks. i could not remember it for the life of me but i said i would sign the card since. that's the least i can do. then he asked where sb was at and i told him up in our radar shop. ten minutes later i saw him red faced and super angry and i asked him what was wrong and he said, ""that shit bag refused to sign the card! he swapped lives with my best friend and you know what he said? he said, 'i didn't know him and i don't care.'!"" i said, ""wait, what do you mean he swapped lives?"" scrubski said, ""shit bag failed every fucking class in radar school but for some fucking reason the chief's kept giving him a pass. when it was time to pick orders he picked last and had to take orders to go to the pentagon. however, because he has a green and brown blob neck tattoo he couldn't take the orders so someone had to give up their orders."" i said, ""are you shitting me? your friend could have been here and shit bag won't sign a card for trading lives?"" for the next year and a half shit bag constantly reminded me in various ways that the better man died."

[SEP]	my parents whole relationship is a butterfly effect, and without that, i wouldn't even exist. my parents both happened to know this one person, in completely unrelated ways. my dad used to work on the stock floor, and knew this person through other people--eventually becoming friends. my mom worked with this person, and became friends through that. there was a dinner party hosted by this person, but my dad was still in a tentative relationship with someone. my parents hit it off, but it took a few more happenstance meetings before their friends basically cajoled them into going on a date. my dad broke up with his girlfriend for unrelated reasons, and eventually began dating my mom. there were one or two instances when my parents almost broke up permanently, but something or someone always saved the relationship. the funniest thing about this is that my mom almost didn't go to the original dinner party; she knew she wouldn't know many people there, and her little introvert self resisted until the last. this was the biggest butterfly effect--had she not gone, she would have never met my dad. her parents (my grandparents) are also a butterfly effect relationship, which is a very interesting coincidence.

[SEP]	"**heads up: somewhat long post below.** when i was in primary school, everyone in class had to write the address of the secondary school they wanted to go to after graduation. there was a briefing of this in class and i didn't listen to a word the teacher said. so i wrote down my home address which was further away from where the school was. so, while most of my school agreed to go to ""secondary school a"" which is near to the primary school, i was assigned to go to ""secondary school b"" which is on the opposite side of town (much further from school a and my home). my dad tried to get me reassigned back to school a (where everyone i knew was going to), but the school was somehow already full and i couldn't get in. so the only alternative (other than going to school b on the other side of town), i got into school c which is nearer to home. interesting note: i was a timid, reclusive child in primary school, never really had close friends and was often picked on and bullied. so in the new school with new faces, i wanted to make a change for myself and decided to be a prefect for the discipline and boost in self-confidence. i became one of the only two prefects to stay one for all 5 years of secondary school (the other was the head prefect). also, school c was the only school in the district to offer ""engineering drawing"" as an elective, so i took the class based on the fact i was good in english and maths and that paved way to my current career as a civil engineer. my engineering classmates was also much better to interact with than my primary classmates and the childhood bullies. they were loads of fun and stupid that it helped me develop my sense of humor, wit, and self-confidence. i can only imagine if i didn't screw up with my school address, i would still be under the mercy of being bullied and restrained by my own self-doubt and crippling anxiety throughout my secondary school life. the environment wouldn't change my outlook and i might have stayed reclusive until i graduate secondary school without any career in mind to take. &#x200b; **tl:dr**: i was reassigned to a different secondary school because i didn't listen to the briefing carefully. without any bullies or people to judge me, i became a prefect to boost my self-confidence. got into the only engineering class elective in the district which eventually led me to become a civil engineer. new classmates helped reshaped myself into a more self-aware, open-minded and confident person. so overall, i'm pretty glad to admit that that one mistake was the only one i didn't regret to make."

[SEP]	"not really know if this can be called as a butterfly effect story, but here goes: i lived in a small apartment when i was still studying and had my own washing machine.it broke down at one point and had to go to a laundromat to wash my clothes, since the technician i called was only able to come and fix it in 1 or 2 weeks.the closest one in my street was closed once i got there and had to walk a bunch of extra blocks to get to the next one.while waiting for my clothes to wash, i noticed i forgot my book and my phone. (i usually put things i need to pack together so i don't forget something, and then forget them all together)because i had nothing else to keep myself occupied i was just looking around at the people coming in and out of the place.that's when i noticed this cute girl coming in. she put her clothes in the washer, walked up to a cash exchange machine when she noticed it was broken.i saw this happening and walked up to her to offer some change.she kindly accepted and started talking afterwards and kinda hit it off. she wanted to give me her phone number. but since i didn't have my phone, she wrote it on a piece of paper. once i got home i grabbed my phone to send her a text to say how nice it was to meet her and if i could take her out sometime. to my horror, i couldn't find the piece of paper anywhere. i walked back to the laundromat to look for it, retraced my route back home, to no avail. in the weeks following i couldn't get this girl out of my head, searching everywhere and feeling angry with myself for losing the paper. i didn't know where she was from, only her first name. this was before facebook was a thing, so i couldn't look for her online. a month or 3 had passed when i got an invite from a friend, who was throwing a huge birthday party. i didn't really feel like it at first, because it was in a another city about 4 hours away. eventually i decided to take the train instead and spend the night there. i did have to switch trains in a small city about halfway the trip. while boarding the second train i was stunned to see her sitting on this very same wagon, reading a book. overexcited, i walked up to her to say hi. she said hi back but immediately got back to her book, kind of ignoring me. stunned, i walked back to my seat feeling absolutely horrible. thinking that she was mad that i didn't text or call her back. judging by the look she gave me, i assumed i had no chance of redeeming myself. i sat there for the next 2 hours pondering myself what to do. &#x200b; before i knew it we arrived at the final station and she disappeared in the crowd before i had a second chance to talk to her. i almost felt ill with remorse blowing it again. &#x200b; i got the motel, dropped of my bag and straightaway left for the party. i still felt somber when i got there and after saying hello to my friend, immediately went to the bar to get myself a strong drink and try to clear my head. that's when i heard someone behind me say ""you have no idea how sorry i am for not recognizing you !"".i turned around and there she was, actually looking happy to see me. i explained i had lost her number and spent days looking for it. being all caught up in her book, and me having my beard grown out a bit and wearing a thick scarf was the reason she didn't recognize me on the train. she did tell me she felt sad for never getting a text or a call and gave me some playful crap about it. it turned out she and my friend who threw the party used to work together during summers. we spent the whole time talking at the party and continued all night after she followed me to my motel room. (no, just talking) in the end i put her number in my phone, emailed it to myself and wrote it on a piece of paper i put in my wallet. just to be sure! &#x200b; to this day, i always wonder how my life would look like if my washing machine didn't break at that exact moment. or if the first laundromat was open instead. or if i didn't forget to bring my book and was to busy reading to notice her. or if.it almost looks like we were destined to find each other. &#x200b; right now, we've been together for 15 years, married for almost 7.bought a house and have a wonderful 5-year-old daughter together. .and she still gives me crap about constantly losing things."

[SEP]	"in high school, i wanted to take french classes but my parents told me to take spanish because i would use it more. &#x200b; i took all levels of spanish in high school, aced the spanish test for college, and got put in the same class as my current boyfriend of nearly 2 and a half years. another butterfly effect that adds on to the previous thing: my older brother came home on spring break from college and asked if i would like to play dungeons & dragons. i obliged, loved it, and played it more in college. it helped me get out of my shell, meet the awesome people that are now like family, and helped me get to know my current boyfriend. &#x200b; hold on, it gets crazier (bear with me, lol). &#x200b; i had a friend from high school, let's call him d. d hung out with me and we played halo, but i needed to go over to my brother's apartment to use his washer (free washers are better than $2 ones in college). my brother was busy at the time, so we left to go to d's dorm and play pokemon monopoly with him and his friends. when pokemon monopoly ended, i started up a game of d&d and my current bf (who was basically a stranger at the time) brought out his mat so i could use it to dm. d and i aren't friends now (he turned into a ""nice guy"" after i started dating) but it's crazy how all of these coincidences happened. &#x200b; &#x200b; if i hadn't listened to my parents, played d&d, or hung out with a former friend, i wouldn't know my current boyfriend existed. it's crazy to think how some really specific events (the certain day we hung out or me playing d&d with my brother) led me to such an amazing person. &#x200b; it's weird because in the spanish class, we would never talk, but we saw each other every weekday. we actually spoke to each other first when i played d&d with him, and then we talked more. to add onto this, he introduced me to larping and amtgard, so if it weren't for all the previous things i wouldn't have been able to meet the huge circle of people i know now (including the guy who got us together, haha). so yeah, huge and oddly specific butterfly effect for this one :p"	[SEP]	42

[SEP]	whenever people like jack bauer just call for some 3d building plans to be sent to his cell phone. typically, architecture/engineering firms don't send out their cad files to anyone. and if they did send those files out, there's no reason for some government agency to have them unless the building was owned by that agency. and they probably wouldn't be 3d (though that is becoming more popular). in reality, jack's friends would call up the building owner, who would put them in touch with the building engineer. then the building engineer would act like he's too busy to help with anything. at some point you *may* get some drawings from him. they will be scanned pdfs. a lot of them will be illegible. they will also most likely be out of date. then when mr. bauer is crawling up around in the ductwork, he'd probably find himself face to face with security bars that are in place to keep people from crawling in the ductwork. and that's if the ductwork is even big enough to have a full grown man in them, let alone able to support the weight. &#x200b; also, government labs. they aren't high tech, black-walled, futuristic super lab. they are nondescript brick buildings with no windows and furniture from 1985.

[SEP]	okay, it wasn't a bathroom floor, it was the floor of a laundromat at an apartment complex (at which i lived). i was 12 and got home after walking from school. but dad hadn't gotten home yet so i was locked out of the apartment. for the record, as a kid i didn't shit at school. couldn't. so now i didn't know what to do, but i knew the shit was coming. i tried holding it in i promise. i moved around, tried occupying my mind with other things, tried running. next thing i know i'm in the corner of the laundromat shitting on the floor. god i'm so ashamed to admit this even 15 years later. i have nightmares about the cleaning staff or the unlucky tenant just trying to get their clothes out of the dryer and coming upon a steaming hot shit right the fuck there. i try to convince myself that they all must've thought it was a dog, but i remember. that shit was distinctly human. it haunts my soul.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	for the same reason people knock over a garbage can or plug up the sink: it's a small act of anti-social behavior. i worked in a movie theater as a teen. right in the middle of the bathroom floor someone dropped one of the largest turds i've ever seen. the main log was incredibly dry and about the width of a pringles can. i still debate to this day whether the poor bastard shat that out real time, or multi-shat in an actual pringles can and then dumped it on the floor. given the size of the log, the time it would take any normal person to squeeze such a massive grogan out, and the absence of blood, i'm leaning toward the pringles can theory. edit: thanks for the awards and opiate poop education everyone!

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	im using one of my throwaways for obvious reasons, i doubt anyone will read this at this point but its quite personal. im in therapy for a lot of things right now and something ive researched a bit about is something that i did as a child thats about the same what op asked. i moved a lot as a child, i wasnt at the same school two years in a row until 8th grade. in the earlier elementary years i used to smear my poops on the walls of the stalls. i remember it feeling out of body to me, like it wasnt me that decided to do it, it just happened. ive learned pretty recently that its likely due to sexual abuse in my very early years. its something like not feeling in control of your own body so youre taking control of something. its something that you make, that your body makes, and this is really all there is to do with it besides flushing it. i didnt do it every time i pooped but until like 5th grade i caught my poop on some toilet paper just to see how much it weighed. i never touched it to my skin or smelled it or tasted it. it was more of a catch and release sort of thing. and sometimes i would smear it. were going to do emdr in therapy about it soon to see if thats the source of a lot of my deep shame feelings. if anyone here has read this far, if you catch a child doing this or hear of someone that got caught doing it, keep an eye out for them. be an ally by (at the very least) being kind to them and deterring further abuses on the playground. help the rumor die if you can or just dont spread it. that may be a child in need of the most dire kind of help. edit: spelling and missed words. edit a bit more: this has been a very unexpected show of support and i thank everyone of you who have commented or pmd me. i hope your awareness and learning helps us collectively and individually end the various cycles of abuse that plague our planet. im nothing near a professional on these matters, just have found myself in a point in my life where ive been able to focus on my inner self and helping it heal from shadowy images ive unknowingly held in my head since i was very small. having said that, please feel free to reach out to me via pm if youd like to talk. this is a throwaway for me so i feel quite comfortable being very honest. seriously, thank you all so much for the awards too, didnt even know we had a platinum one.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	"god, i hate to answer this question. not highschool, but middle school. i swear it was an accident. tl;dr - i had 3 days of shit piled up in my colon at the end of the school day, and miscalculated the proximity of my buttcheeks to the toilet, resulting in me shitting directly infront of a toilet. ok, so, there i was in computer class. we're on mavis or whatever that thing was that teaches you how to type efficiently. computer was our last class of the day, then we could go home. well, that morning, i was just not feeling well. i was the typical faker, and would say ""i'm not feeling well"" to my parents time and time again and pray they wouldn't take me to school. but i felt like shit. dunno why, or what caused it, but i was genuinely sick to my stomach and felt like barfing all day long. so, my parents tell me to use the restroom, maybe i'll feel better afterwards. i went, and nothing came out, mostly due to me being a little anxious at the time. i'm anally-retentive, meaning i pucker my anus as much as i can and refuse to poop anywhere that isn't my toilet at home, partly because anxiety, partly due to me being a mild clean freak. this makes long car rides and airplane travel extremely difficult, and requires me to eat very little before travelling. anyway, i digress. so, around lunchtime, i decided to have some pizza. pizza day happens once a week, and it's 50c a slice, so i was like, why not? i'll gorge a little. after lunch comes p.e., which i resented so much. who designed our schedule to allow a bunch of full, sweaty kids to eat and then right after, play some football? always pissed me off the way our schedule was set up. anyway, come p.e., and i'm like, waddling as to not shit myself. i had an opportunity to go use the restroom, but the restrooms were nasty, because sweaty boys + the pizza shits = a disgusting aftermath. i went to the restroom, saw the stunned remains of an absolute unit of a turd, which the toilet did not fully eradicate. went to another stall, just as disgusting as the first. third was less nasty, but there was something on the toilet seat (liquid, not solid) and just decided to wait til i got home to release the build-up of at least 3 days worth of shit. i should've taken my opportunity with stall number three. oh, how i regret that decision. math and history went off fine, in between those classes and my last class was a break, in which time i decided was a great time to get a snack and a can of coke. consumed both quickly and headed upstairs for computer. i sat down, and immediately the urge hit me. i waited. and waited. and waited. class started, and we were to do our assignments. we were allowed to do them unmonitered, as she was super lax and didn't care - we could literally cheat and she wouldn't care. i was naturally good at typing (thanks to runescape) and finished my assignments. i immediately darted out the class without asking to use the restroom, or with the bathroom pass, which was a big no-no in my school. i had a detention waiting for me when i got back, but i didn't care. i was just seconds away from my shit providing enough thrust to launch me to the stratosphere. i went to the bathroom, and wouldn't you know it, all the stalls are full. so, i did the only reasonable thing i could do. i went to the girls restroom. i then second-guessed that thought. so now, i was torn. do i wait? do i go down the stairs and risk shitting my way to the moon? do i risk getting caught by a girl in the girls room? i made a decision to go downstairs, and i could feel it nearly poking out my sphincter. so i ran into the restroom, pulled my pants off and placed them on my bag (i like to poop naked, sue me) and before i sat, i looked. it was the grossest stall of all time. *someone didnt flush! red alert, red alert!* my little 12 year old brain could not stand the thought of my shit touching someone elses shit, and risking the possibility of the shit splashing back onto my ass. so, i squatted above the toilet seat, and released. my calculations were so exact, that with the force i exerted on my sphincter, and the proximity of my asshole to the toilet, that i thought the shit was gonna land square in the hole, and all would be said and done. my calculations were off. by a lot. i was a good couple inches from being anywhere close to the toilet. so i shat *right infront of the toilet* i went into panick mode. i flipped out; do i clean it up? do i let leguizama (the schools janitor) clean it up? am i gonna get a detention for this? or worse, a saturday school??? so, i wiped, put the tp in the toilet, and didn't even flush. i washed and walked out, obviously panicked. i was so self concious and anxious at the time, that i sprayed myself down with the choicest body spray around, axe body spray, to mask the smell of shit that i know would linger around until i showered. i walked out of that stall anxious as could be, and got a drink of water, and went back to class. the next day, an announcement was made before the pledge of allegiance, stating that there was a dookie dropped in front of the toilet, and not in the toilet in the bathroom across the computer lab. for some reason, i felt proud of myself. i wasn't caught, and i'm sure mr. leguizama was the one who cleaned it up."

[SEP]	i once took an insane amount of cough syrup during my high school philosophy class. the teacher decided to show a movie that day, fuckin great right? nope. 20 minutes in i got the strongest urge to just throw up everywhere. i didnt even ask the teacher to step out i just straight up left and rushed towards the bathroom. i remember throwing up at the very entrance to the bathroom leaving a trail of puke leading towards the toilet where i proceeded to regurgitate half my body weight. fun times at coral park.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	once i was at a hospital where my dad was admitted after a heart attack. my sister and i, both adults at this point, stayed overnight. i had to pee super super bad and went to the bathroom like a normal person does for such and the lone toilet in the room was just like the toilets of my nightmares when i have to pee really bad and am having a dream of needing a toilet you know? full of blood, poop, tampons even maybe some pads idk i almost lurched anyway my need to pee wasnt going anywhere so feeling like i have zero choice - i had been looking for awhile for a bathroom that didnt say patients only for a good twenty minutes and it was like 3 in the morning i had drank lots of caffeine anywho there i go and pee on the floor. i find my way back to our little designated icu lounge we had kind of a private area with all the possible amenities of a hospital you could imagine decent ish lounge chairs, pillows, blankets, free soda and snacks all you could need with the exception of working restrooms. now, there were restrooms there in that utopia of a hospital waiting area but they both had closed for cleaning signs and had them for awhile. i feel like maybe they just put them on at night so not to be bothered with them and it seemed in all the little private family lounge areas all was quite except for ours and i guess maybe because the heart attack had just happened that day with an emergency surgery the adrenaline of the day made it to where we just couldnt sleep. so after doing my dirty business in the dirty bathroom i return and my sister is gone. now this is about 2004 or so, we had cellphones but i dont think we had texting or if we did it was limited and yada yada so im clueless as to where she was but unconcerned i had been missing awhile i assume she goes to look for me- we had some sort of device that the nurses station let us know if there was an issue with my dad so i settle back in and she returns to tell me the exact same story i had about a disgusting bathroom that she pees on the floor of because she sees no alternative. now were not sure at this point if its the same bathroom because we had both wandered aimlessly to find it. the hospital is big and all we both knew is that it we didnt leave the cardiac area- we were both scared of getting lost (in hindsight why we didnt just go together is beyond me). at any rate she said the floor had been wet but with the toilet i saw being overflowed and nasty we still didnt know. the day had been awful and my dad went from most likely being dead to most likely being okay by midnight that night we had been through it and suddenly nothing was more important to us than knowing if we golden showered the same bathroom so we went to find it. we stumble upon the place that, sure enough, we both had used only to see another woman stumble out, shell shocked, and advising us to find another toilet. fifteen years later we still talk about it.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	not the bathroom floor but on the last day of school back in grade 11, someone took a massive diarrhea-shit in one of the stairwells. it was all over the stairs; not sure if someone stepped in it or the pooper dropped his load while going down the stairs. edit: there were also frequent urinal dukes throughout that year. pretty sure my high school just had some crazed diarrhea-fiend that year.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	so best story ever. my first day of grade 1 elementary school. we get just a basic tour of the school facilities and we don't really do any real work. we're in the gym class getting a rundown of gym. we do some fun activities. suddenly i gotta go. bad. i ask the teacher to let me shit. he's like yeah. he knows what's up. i go into the bathroom he pointed out. i look inside. no toilets. all i see if these big tall metal structures with faucets at the top of them. drains in the bottom. wtf is this shit? so i keep looking and looking and no toilets and i really gotta go. so i just go into the thing and then pull my pants up and walk out like normal. later that day the principal comes on the intercom announcement and is furious!! he vows to find who shit in the showers. anyway as far as i know he never found out it was me.

[SEP]	not pooping on the bathroom floor in high school, but maybe related. once i was going to sleep on the couch at a friends house after a night of drinking out. we were all about 23 at the time. im just about to drift to sleep when i see a female figure, in the dark, walk into the living room, back up to a corner, drop trou, and start pissing on the hardwood floor. im all like, wut. am i really witnessing this? come to find out they suspected this roommate of doing this on a regular basis but never had proof. i guess she didnt know i was in the room at the time. her excuse was a shrug, and an indication it gave her some jollies. people are weird.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	finally, some shit i can answer so last spring, i was doing snow day outings as a counselor on an outdoor resort. someone thought it would be a great idea to send 7 year olds to a sleepover outing that week, and i can attest that it was the worst fucking idea anyone has had in the last 2 years. first off, breakfast is served at 8am, so i usually wake the kids up at 7 45 so they can get dressed. not that group. no, that group decided they should wake up at 5 30 am and play hide and seek (and hide under my bed, pulling my sheets for additional cover). ''but random guy on reddit, what does any of that have to do with shitting on the floor??'' you ask. im getting to it so, as im trying to ignore the hide and seek and lie to myself thinking i'll just go back to sleep, i hear '' eeeeeeeeew raj (fictional name) peed in the trashcan!!!'' i get up (very begrudgingly) to go and confirm this event, and sure enough, the wastepaper basket was half full of pee. you see, our poor raj was suspected (yet still undiagnosed) to suffer from autism, and had trouble with social behaviors and how to act with others. he explained that while playing hide and seek, he was confronted with a choice either leave his hiding spot and go to the washroom, or stay hidden, pee in the adjacent trash can, and maybe win. and raj ain't no fucking loser.

[SEP]	we had a group of 3 vending machines right near the gym in case visitors wanted a snack and we didn't have a snack table set up, but mostly we would walk over there to take a break to talk or whatever and grab a couple snacks for class. my buddy dropped a deuce next to it because his special talent was pooping in random places, or as he called himself a pirp. that was his freshman year. senior year rolls around and they wanted to do a senior prank related to that. he went to the stalls in the gym bathroom and removed the dividers and brought them out and set them on the ground in front of the vending machines. he then printed a picture of poop out and taped it to the ground and had some whitty caption to go with it.

[SEP]	classmates paid the local class idiot to poop in the laptop of the class administrator. i hated the idiot, but hated the administrator more so i chipped in. he slipped into his office as a bunch of kids pretended to start a fight that he needed to intervene in. he took the laptop, opened it like a book and held it under his ass and dropped the bomb. **then he closed it up with the turd in it.** to this day i have hysterical laughing fits at the idea of that shit getting squeezed between the keys. no loud or otherwise angry reaction though. he just locked his office knowing he can't let the kids see him because that's what they wanted. but we knew better, and that was good enough.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	i was feeling really really really awful and i happen to be going at both ends. literally on my way walking out of the building, i got a kick in my stomach telling me i had to throw up right now. so i go to the bathroom and throw up and realize hey! i also need to shit! so i consider my options: i can throw up on the floor and shit in the toilet, or shit on the floor and throw up in the toilet. now i have some serious issues related to pooping and im actually quite used to cleaning up shit off the floor, and i know its going to be in more of a piece than vomit, so i chose the latter. five minuets and im done so i do my best to clean up after myself, write a note that says im really sorry i wasnt feeling well and stick it too the empty toilet paper roll (i cleaned up with some paper towels i got) so only they will see it and leave as fast as i can. still feel absolutely horrible about doing it. ive known a person who did it out of anti-establishment reasons, but its not like theyre super there in the head. i tried telling them they were only hurting the custodians and they insisted the head of our school district would hear about it and resign for it because it would make him realize how shitty (get it) of a person he was. he did resign, but for other reasons, three years later. she thought it was because of her and was sent to the hospital a month later because she told her mom that the district head who stepped down was coming after her in the form of a fly, and that he built a machine to turn himself into said fly and that she has him captured but she doesnt want to kill him because shell be arrested for murder. shes on medicine now and doing much better, if youre wondering.

[CLS]	people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	[SEP]	hahaha wasn't me and wasn't on the bathroom floor, but when i was in middle school, we had weird kids and weird bathrooms. there was an area with a large rounded sink for several people to use at once and no doors-- you would just walk into either the women's or men's (kind of hard to explain.) the school must've thought these security measures were enough for the bathroom so there were no security cameras anywhere. well, that changed one day when some kid took a dump in one of the sinks. ha. for a whole month, that bathroom was blocked off and we had an assembly discussing school rules. when the bathroom finally opened, the kid took another dump in the sink *the day it opened.* the bathroom was closed off again and they had security cameras installed around every bathroom. the kid was never caught though, hahaha.

[SEP]	my mother's scream. this low, ungodly wail without tears, like a mortal wound, when she found out that my younger sister had died in a car accident. i'll remember that sound for the rest of my life, and the way she raced at me, grabbed my face in both of her hands, and wail-screamed, 'this wasn't your fault' before falling to pieces. it's been six years. my family is closer than ever but none of us have recovered from the loss. whenever things get overwhelming, i just think of that wail and realize that no matter how bad it gets, i will never be the one to cause that sound. edit: i came back to so much love and so many heartbreaking and heartwarming messages of solidarity and kindness and empathy and i cannot thank you all enough for not only sharing your stories. thank you all so much. and, as there was talk of it, the tl;dr of the story was that my sister was troubled. we were closer than she'd been to anyone, but she found a guy she really liked and she got into drugs and wound up stealing percocet from me after a surgery i'd had. she was subsequently kicked out of the house because i pushed for it (she was 21, and she'd drained my parents of over 10k over the course of a year; they didn't know about the drugs until i told them) and she left to find her way with her drug-dealer boyfriend in alberta. she got sick out there. i refused to talk to her; i felt betrayed. you always feel like you'll have more time. but within 3 months she fell asleep at the wheel of a car and met a van head-on. i know, logically, that it's not my fault, but my mother knew how i felt responsible for the fallout. four years of therapy, and we're all doing much better than we were. but please, if you need help, call one of the hotlines listed in the pinned comment of this thread. you're worth it.

(our class got the pictures to go with this story, they're online somewhere i'm sure but i do not recommend) he survived and a year later, more desperate to die than ever, attempted to od on pain pills he had been hoarding, but survived again.

[SEP]	i did a lot of spinning and weaving at the time, just for fun. in about august of 99, polly showed up at our weekly gathering. she bought 1000+ dollars of spinning and carding equipment from a dealer in the group. bought half a dozen sheep from susan. comes time to deliver the sheep, susan drives them out there, finds out that polly just moved to this country house with her kids and husband a month ago, and doesnt have any fences up, so doesnt actually have a place to put the sheep. they work it out with a neighbor to put them in an unused paddock until fences can go up. polly keeps coming to our weekly spin-in, but she wont listen to any teaching or advice -shes read all about spinning, so she knows how. keep in mind spinning is like riding a bike - you can read all you want, but its not going to teach your muscles the needed coordination. after a couple months, she finally condescends to take a bit of our instruction, and starts getting the hang of things, and starts opening up. turns out polly has bought this fence-less hobby farm for y2k, and she fully expects to be making all their own clothes. the (teenage) kids are going to card all the wool, and shes going to spin and weave everything. we politely roll our eyes, privately calculating how many years our closets full of clothes will last us before we have to wear handspun. come december, we stop holding meetings, because december. january rolls around, y2k having come and gone, and none of us ever lay eyes on her again. ive always wondered what she did and where she went.

[SEP]	the phone numbers im calling. im a nurse and i often call patients with their test results. one time i was showing a medical student how i perform the result calls. its not uncommon for me to call and get the patients voicemail that goes youve reached ###-###-####. please leave a voicemail at the beep and sometimes patients give us permission to leave their test results as a voicemail. while i was demonstrating a call and leaving the results as a voicemail, the medical student pointed to the phone and pointed out that i had switched 2 numbers around, so i had called the wrong number, and i was about to leak private health information! thankfully the voicemail had an erase voicemail and restart option, so i erased the voicemail and hung up. now i always double check the phone numbers im calling, in case it ever happens again!!

[SEP]	"i run the front desk at a hotel and they are an absolute nightmare. they also straight up lie to the guests and to the hotels constantly. truly one of the most shady companies i've ever dealt with. they purposely try and deceive people who don't know any better into thinking that they are dealing with the hotel directly. they create adds in such a way that when people google the hotel's phone number, a number to expedia comes up, and if the customer asks if the are speaking directly with the hotel front desk they will say yes. there have been countless times where guests have called to cancel their reservation that was booked through expedia. i inform them that they will have to contact expedia directly, since they pre-paid through them, but that it will be no issue because the hotel does not charge a penalty fee for cancellation. an expedia representative will call the hotel with the guest on hold and ask about getting it cancelled. i tell them it's no problem. they ask if we will be charging a penalty fee, and i tell them no. all is right and good, right? nope. i then get a call back from the guest who is upset, saying that the expedia representative told them they could not be refunded because of the fee charged by the hotels cancellation policy. taking the guests money and blaming it on the hotel, and keeping all of the profit. this has happened countless times. i once had a guest while at the front desk call about cancelling 3 days out of a multiple day reservation, as she had to leave earlier than expected. they pulled the same bullshit with her, not knowing that she was at the front desk. after me telling the representative that the cancellation is fine and we will not be charging any penalties, they get back on the phone with her and blatantly lie. i asked her to hand her phone to me and that was quite a surprise for the representative. who said that ""there must have been a misunderstanding""."

[SEP]	used to be a health inspector. in my first year a lot of my old favorite restaurants were ruined for me, but none so bad as the discount sushi place my college bestie and i used to frequent. they had roaches bad. in my time at the health department i never saw them worse than in that kitchen. we got calls about the roaches at least twice a month, and every time we went they were back with a vengeance. they were closed for them multiple times, but just never kept up with the pest control and cleaning necessary to get rid of them. they were also dying tilapia red and selling it as red snapper on their menu. this is pretty common around here, but it's super illegal because it's literal false advertising. fun fact: some people are allergic to tilapia. not sure i want to be around when that restaurant owner finds that out. they had hundreds of cardboard boxes stacked outside their back door, plus a bunch of old equipment they weren't using. this added to the roach problem and any day it could turn into a rodent problem. one time i drive by and they had animal cages back there, too. i don't wanna know that story. add to that: i'm pretty sure the employees are all indentured servants or victims of human trafficking. they all show up in the same beat up white van every day and work a 12+ hour shift. the owner is unkind to them and they don't respect him. he says he can trust them to do their jobs, but was sketchy when we said to fire them and hire employees who will. we never had proof, but it was always upsetting and struck me as off. he tried to bribe me and my coworkers multiple times, too. i'm not a health inspector anymore but he still tries to give me free food or money when he sees me. he opened a new restaurant and i didn't know it was his, so and friend and i went to go check it out. i was told that appetisers were free for me only. then i saw him in the back. we had to leave. never again. it's too sketchy and too likely to get me sick.

(edit: for the people who can't gather this from context, that was unusual. all the times i'd gone to the bar before, i got itemized receipts. all of my friends that night got itemized receipts when they closed out.) i spent 20 minutes, on my birthday, at the bar, calling out the bartender's name, asking for an itemized receipt, while he pretended he could neither see nor hear me. i went home and reached out to management and explained the story to them, including how long i tried to get his attention. her reply: ""if you thought there was an issue with your receipt, you should have asked the bartender to explain it to you."" never again. case anyone cares, it's penn social in dc. edit: since this seems to be coming up a lot: this is america, so not ""chip and pin"". they won't serve you unless they first swipe your credit card. i could not simply ""leave without paying"", it was going to be charged to me no matter what. my experience with disputing charges is that it's not super convenient, so i was really hoping to be able to deal with this at the bar without having to do that. so please don't be one of the 337 people who have told me ""i would have just left."" edit: thank you for the silver, kind stranger. if anyone else wants to do the same, please donate the money to a charity instead, or just give it to a homeless person."

(first place was the *sun*, just about, but it was dwarfed by the combined figures for the other four.) occasionally a newsagent will do an offer where you can buy the *mail* for 50p or so and get a bottle of water or a chocolate bar worth a pound for free, which leads to the ever-present quandary of whether or not i buy the paper and hope that they lose money on it, or pay full price for the water or chocolate just so i don't push their circulation numbers up. i'd say it's an irrational hatred, but i don't even think it is. they're an organisation that i genuinely believe makes the world worse just by existing.

[SEP]	i once listened to a podcast where they explained the sound from these high budget nature documentaries is implied to be but not actually diegetic. as in, the sound isn't actually the sound that the animals etc are making. that sound is added in post. all those rustling trees and vocalisations are recorded before or after or might even be from animals in captivity, and are put onto the scene. part of this makes sense. you can't record sound with clarity underwater, and you couldn't hear anything in these long shots in real life. once you know this, you will definitely notice. are those animals vocalising too often? why is that tree making so much noise? how did they decide what sound this fish was going to make when it moves? you realise this is as much a constructed experience as any other film.

[SEP]	"i am probably too late to this, but just in case it helps someone, whenever i suffer from my ""depression phase"" i read the following which someone said on reddit and has always stayed with me. i have literally copied it and pasted it in my google notes and it gives me immense hope to stay alive. &#x200b; >"" i've survived (so far) and a lot of people i've known and loved did not. i've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. i have no children, and i can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. but here's my two cents. i wish i could say you get used to people dying. i never did. i don't want to. it tears a hole through me whenever somebody i love dies, no matter the circumstances. but i don't want it to ""not matter"". i don't want it to be something that just passes. my scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that i had for and with that person. and if the scar is deep, so was the love. so be it. scars are a testament to life. scars are a testament that i can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that i can heal and continue to live and continue to love. and the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. scars are a testament to life. scars are only ugly to people who can't see. as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. when the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. and all you can do is float. you find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. maybe it's some physical thing. maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. maybe it's a person who is also floating. for a while, all you can do is float. stay alive. in the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. they come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. all you can do is hang on and float. after a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. when they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. but in between, you can breathe, you can function. you never know what's going to trigger the grief. it might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. it can be just about anything.and the wave comes crashing. but in between waves, there is life. somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. or 50 feet tall. and while they still come, they come further apart. you can see them coming. an anniversary, a birthday, or christmas, or landing at o'hare. you can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. and when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. take it from an old guy. the waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. but you learn that you'll survive them. and other waves will come. and you'll survive them too. if you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. and lots of shipwrecks.

[SEP]	"my aunt was one of the sweetest and most loving people i had ever met. she had a mental handicap and essentially spent her life with the mindset of a four year old girl. she couldn't do much on her own but loved stuffed animals, walking around target looking for new toys or music, just basically spending time with us. she developed breast cancer which at the time i thought was no big deal. i was certain with today's medicine they would just cut it out, give her some treatment and life would go back to normal. less than a year later she had been admitted to the e.r. several times because she just stopped breathing on her own and was constantly losing consciousness. the cancer had spread to her lungs and brain. about 1/3 of her brain matter on the ct scan was just a blob of cancer at that point. she always said she loved me a lot but the two things that hurt the most were her last words to me: ""big brother, help me. help me. help me."" she had always called me her little brother when i was growing up. but i guess at this point she knew i was the one taking care of her. hearing her call me her big brother and just asking over and over for me to help me was heartbreaking. it still hurts thinking about that."

[SEP]	i don't know if this has already been stated but this is something to admire about atheists. >[why did god create atheists?](https://randysrandom.com/god-create-atheists/) there is a famous story told in chassidic literature that addresses this very question. the master teaches the student that god created everything in the world to be appreciated, since everything is here to teach us a lesson. one clever student asks what lesson can we learn from atheists? why did god create them? the master responds god created atheists to teach us the most important lesson of them all  the lesson of true compassion. you see, when an atheist performs an act of charity, visits someone who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is not doing so because of some religious teaching. he does not believe that god commanded him to perform this act. in fact, he does not believe in god at all, so his acts are based on an inner sense of morality. and look at the kindness he can bestow upon others simply because he feels it to be right. this means, the master continued that when someone reaches out to you for help, you should never say i pray that god will help you. instead for the moment, you should become an atheist, imagine that there is no god who can help, and say i will help you. martin buber, tales of hasidim vol. 2 (1991)	[SEP]	288

[SEP]	"community. i'm essentially an atheist (ignostic really, but that's not a term people use), but i really admire the sense of community that religions offer. i think so many people in the us are lonely, and religion is a great way for people to have an ""extended community"" of people who have something in common. i love the religions that offer some kind of support system for people who need help (medical bills, losing jobs). i love that you often get to know people in your neighborhood who you might see on other days. it's really hard for an atheist to have the same thing. you can do meetups, but most aren't held on a weekly schedule if they're consistent at all. and you rarely meet people nearby. the lack of extended community is, imo, one of the reasons companies are able to harness that need and turn it into work. i despise companies that talk about being a family (that you lose when fired), and i'm cynical about team-building exercises and companies where everyone hangs out with each other on weekends. it leads to nasty cliques, people taking work too seriously, and people working hard because their whole life centers around it. silicon valley is full of companies taking advantage of people's need for interaction to place themselves at the center, but it benefits the company and builds a really fragile community. i work from home now and i'm really struggling to find this. everyone just goes home and disappears into their garages, and it's hard to find new friends and new communities at this age (mid 30s) while everyone is busy with work and kids. i've been to countries where everyone comes out at night, has a little bbq, and talks to each other. they walk around and play games with neighbors or just say hi. i really wish everyone did that here. i really wish our sense of community wasn't tied to religion, because i don't think it should have to be, and i really wish the american community wasn't a thing of the past."

[CLS]	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	[SEP]	i grew out of islam in college, but i really admired the shared narrative and power of the ummah. islam is big on collective action and community. the ummah, or the community surround themselves with many principles based on kindness, charity and love of your fellow man. when i was deeply in the faith - it felt like i could ask for anything. we addressed each other as brothers and sisters. are you traveling? reach out to a local mosque they'll let you stay at their facility or find a community member that can find you a bed. need money, or are you sick? the mosque could allow you to present your case to the community during prayer. there one could ask for prayer or donations. daycare? therapist? food? go to the mosque. &#x200b; there was also the call to action. you were often encouraged to donate to the poor, volunteer or just be a good person. the community would self police negative behaviors, or intervene in family conflicts. it really was beautiful. but the thing i miss the most - the routines. lunch time prayer and evening prayer we go to the mosque. friday prayer meet at the mosque. ramadan, spend all night at the mosques praying. i can't accept the existence of an abrahamic god for reasons that wouldn't be productive to explain, or haven't been said before. that lack of faith makes attempts at participating in the community feel disingenuous. i'd feel like i'm tainting something pure by faking it. i really admire this though. this raise to a call and devote faith in something. the camaraderie around something bigger than yourself.

[CLS]	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	[SEP]	there are a few things i admire about religion. first and foremost is the fellowship between members of a congregation. that's a thing i think people miss the most about quitting their church. often they will try something like unitarian universalists to try to recapture that. secondly, i think religious devotion has inspired some of the greatest art and architecture the world has ever seen. when i think of the world's most beautiful buildings, i think of places like notre dame, the blue mosque, the sistine chapel, angor wat, the white temple, or the simple unadorned but iconic white protestant country church with it's simple steeple. then there is the art like the last supper, the ceiling in the sistine chapel, the sculpture of christ the redeemer in rio. finally, i think religion, when at its best, encourages people to act selflessly. to donate to help strangers in need, to send food, clothing or money to those in need. one doesn't need religion to act selflessly. or morally. but if that encouragement is there, i think it's a good thing.

[CLS]	atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	[SEP]	regarding atheists, i would say this. while some people are dogmatic about it many are not. as an example, i am an american convert to hinduism. i have a friend who is actually somewhat prominent in atheist circles. during some difficult times, he has encouraged me in my faith in that he has seen the changes it has made in me, and seen the seriousness of my commitment. while he doesn't believe in my faith, he believes in my dedication. in fact, he more than once, during my time as a monk, made donations to help me go on pilgrimages to see my guru. many atheist i have known are like that. i have even found, provided you don't preach, you can share aspects of the philosophy and be heard and appreciated.

[SEP]	4th year med student reporting in. had a rotation with a pediatrician where we ended up in the classic encounter with an anti-vaccination parent. this lady was a conspiracy theory magnet. she casually mentioned everything from 9/11 to chemtrails. of course she loved the idea of the vaccine conspiracy as well, opting to not protect her one year old to stick it to big pharma. i relayed all of this to my attending after my exam (i would see the patient first, gather history and do my exam to present to my attending physician). he got this sort of lazy smirk on his face that screamed watch this. we go back into the exam room and we cover all of the important bits of a well-child encounter. growth charts, behavioral milestones, nutrition, sleep. and then we get to vaccines. she lists approximately 15 reasons why vaccines are more dangerous than the disease they protect against (lol) in addition to the various evils of the pharmaceutical industry. my attending listens quietly until shes done with her soapbox (about one eternity later), and then interjects with: have you considered the possibility that anti-vaccine propaganda could be an attempt by the russians or the chinese to weaken the health of the united states population? in a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, i swear i heard a strange popping noise as her brain misfired. it actually broke her. the allure of the increasingly ridiculous conspiracy theory was just too strong. she ended up agreeing to a modified vaccine schedule. i was flabbergasted. my attending just grinned at me in response. to this day im not sure the medical ethics of the situation are totally palatable, but goddamn the result was amazing. edit: thanks for the internet points, remember folks, its all for the kids.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	[SEP]	pediatric resident here in the us. our continuity clinic accepts everyone, including those kicked out of previous practices for anti-vaccination beliefs, which is a bit frustrating at times. really, it's a mixed bag for how we can handle these patients. ostracizing the parents is only going to build further barriers between provider and kid, so that doesn't help. frankly, what has worked best in my experience is to try to understand where the families are coming from, explicitly asking what their thoughts are on vaccines to let them voice their (mis)understandings. oftentimes, this is the first time they've been allowed to talk about their questions and concerns regarding vaccines with a trained md that doesn't just belittle them. most frustratingly, it takes patience and time. assessing where they are regarding change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, etc.) helps determine where we are for vaccinating them today, in a month, or in a few months. one thing that i do draw the line on is to make sure that we see these kids more frequently than normal children, as they are at higher risks for illnesses because they are not vaccinated (no room for negotiation on that point). this helps two fold: first, it helps build rapport with the family, but also secondly, if they decide to take a delayed schedule (which is still not ideal, but better than no vaccines), we can eventually catch them up to speed with their vaccinations by frequent return visits. interestingly, it's always the yoga-pant's karen types that are the antivaxxer (or pro-measles as i've been calling them lately) rather than the less educated single mom's on welfare or the recent immigrants that speak no english. ultimately, we're the kids docs and their advocates, and are most effective when we ally with the families (or better put, get the families to ally with us) and do have to be stern after a certain point. it's a mix of being stern, but also compromising to work with families to provide their kids as much and the best (data supported) care as possible.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	[SEP]	i have the opposite of what youre expecting to hear, i assume. as a medical student, i went to see a young child (<1yo) in the outpatient clinic before the attending. the child was due for vaccines, and i talked to the parents about getting them on that day. the parents said they had reservations about them, so i talked to them about their reservations. we talked about all of the things they had read on the internet, and walked through each point one by one (one of the benefits of being the medical student is that you have nothing but time). i explained how vaccines are made and how they work (they dont have the mercury preservative they once did; some vaccines are live but attenuated and others are immunogenic sequences bound to a protein), and why we get so many so early (thats when youre most likely to be affected by these diseases). they were concerned about the effects of so many vaccines at once (this is a common concern, but we challenge your system less with a vaccine than you see walking around in the world every day) and about them making the child sick (not possible with anything but a live vaccine, and thats why those are attenuated; theyre such a small dose that a non-immunocompromised individual should have no problem with them even though you might feel a little sick because we activate your immune system and thats how you feel when that happens). the whole discussion took probably half an hour. and then they decided to go forward with the vaccines. as it turns out, most people are just scared. and who can blame them? with all of the misinformation in the world, its easy to see how parents get to that point. but they also are human, and when you sit and talk to them like the people that they are (intelligent and able to understand your points) they respond in a positive way. its one of the moments in medical school that i reflect on frequently, especially when things are tough and i feel like being impatient with people. edit: thanks for popping my gold cherry y'all. so happy to hear about everyone who has had similar experiences with doctors taking the time to listen to their concerns and explain the responses to them. i hope everyone can work to reduce cynicism about this and other important problems.

[SEP]	ok ok i am not a doctor but i'm pregnant so i see one pretty regularly right now lol it was time for my tdap booster and i was asking about the mmr booster. my ob asked if we are planning to vaccinate the baby, and i told him that shouldn't even be a question he feels he needs ask any of his patients. so he told me this story about a teenage patient who came in with her mom. the mom was going on and on about how she teaches her child to live a healthy and holistic lifestyle free of drugs, vaccines, and chemicals. well turned out the daughter had gotten gonorrhea from her boyfriend despite her healthy and holistic lifestyle. my ob said he felt great seeing the mother's face when he delivered the news lol	[SEP]	1547

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	[SEP]	not a dr. when i was a kid i was in boy scouts. i was older around 16-17 and one of the younger kids around 12 was from a really religious family that homeschooled all the kids. well, this kid had to go to the bathroom at 2 in the morning. so he got out of his tent to go piss. he was barefoot and cut a large slice into the ball of his foot by stepping on a piece of flint. the gash was almost two inches long and needed a lot of stitches. i was the largest person at the camp, so i had to carry the kid a mile to our vehicles. the adults and i then drove him to the medical lodge where they would take care of him (this camp had several thousand boys in it during the summer, so they always had a doctor on staff). well, the doctor cleaned the wound and gave the boy the stitches and then talked to him about the importance of wearing shoes outside. the kid had always gone around barefoot at home, so it was just second nature for him. it's one thing to walk around your manicured yard barefoot, but to walk around a rocky campground, at night, with coperheads and rattlesnakes is something that should never be done. we were almost done with the doctor when he said he needed to give the boy a tetanus shot. he looked at the boy's medical chart that was loaded on his computer (we had to get physicals to come to the camp, all these were scanned and loaded into a computer so that any boy could go to either of the 2 medical areas and they would be able to look up the info). the dr. said he could not give the boy a tetanus shot because the boy never had the initial shot or series. in fact, the kid had never received any shots or vaccines. the doctor was honestly confused as to how the boy had been allowed to come to camp that year. the dad was with us and was basically bragging about how none of his 8 kids were vacinated. the dr ripped him a new one and told him how agonizing and painful lockjaw was. so the doctor didn't have the shot that was needed (because everyone was supposed to have already had that prior to coming to camp). we had to drive 40 minutes to the nearest hospital at 3:00 in the morning. we didn't get back until after 5:00. after that fiasco, our troop told the family that they needed to vacinate all the kids or they would never be allowed to participate in the troop. we would often do family events where young siblings would also come and participate. things like bbqs, fundrasers, day camps, etc. the troop didn't want any of these young children to be exposed to something by any of these kids. it turns out the antivax mom had been put in charge of collecting and turning in the health forms to the camp staff. she obviously just pushed her children through without making sure they had the shot record section filled out. the camp staff somehow just missed it. so she was quickly removed from that role and it was given to two other adult leaders. the camp also set an earlier deadline to submit medical forms and physicals to give them more time to review everything. the family did vaccinate their kids because they were homeschooled and lived outside the city. this was one of the few programs that their kids could do with other children that were in a conservative-minded organization.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	[SEP]	pediatrician for 28 years here. the stories of changed minds do exist, but in my experience, they are few and far between. most of those who refuse are upper middle class, well educated, and have done personal research that has entrenched their opinions. i had one family years ago who all got pertussis; the whooping cough. they were miserable, but still had no regrets, believing that their choice was the best one for their family at the time. i dont argue with beliefs, and they remained my patients until they aged out. all refusers bring personal experience and knowledge, and expect me to be moved by their anecdotes. i in turn share with them my personal experience and knowledge, recalling having to pull pus from spinal taps done on extremely irritable babies with super high fevers. a normal spinal fluid should instead flow clear. the culture would usually grow hemophilis type b. that was my last year in residency, pretty close to the year the hib vaccine came out; i havent seen a case of invasive hemophilus disease since. but my experience and reason doesnt matter for many, and regurgitating the plethora of studies in favor of vaccines only solidifies their stance. the most sobering case was a neonate, too young to be vaccinated, who was exposed to a community of non-vaccinated children out west. he was diagnosed here, east of the mississippi, and spent three weeks in three different pediatric icus in the area before he was stable enough to go home. and the conventional wisdom that says chickenpox is no big deal. in residency i watched a teenager come in to our er (lebonheur, memphis tn) with chickenpox and die days later with overwhelming sepsis. over time, ive distilled my response to those who wish to argue to: in the end, your position holds that the experts at the acip, the aap, and. well. me. we all willingly place children in harms way. im sorry you feel that way. our practice (http://clevelandpediatrics.net) currently asks families who choose not to vaccinate to please find a pediatrician who they can trust completely. if they choose not to vaccinate, thats not us.

[SEP]	my oldest made a 32 on his act, finished college algebra with a 98 while a junior on high school. but he has no common sense. once, when he was around 16yo, my wife asked for help cooking. she had pork chops marinating in a glass dish. since i was running late from work she asked him to put them on the grill to cook. he asked how he was supposed to get them out of the dish, to which she replied, you can use a fork. instead of picking up the glass dish and taking it up the grill, he proceeds to get a fork and pick up one pork chop, and carry it outside, and do them one at a time this way.

[SEP]	as a rule of thumb: do they make your life better? if not, then it's not a good friendship. i came to this realization with a couple of long term friends i had from back in the day. they would never really do anything nice for you, we basically just hung out out of habit. you couldn't expect them to be there for you if you needed a favor, even small ones. with one there was also constant ribbing, he'd play it off as joking, but it was closer to insults. i eventually came to the realization that these guys don't make my life better in any way. i can replace them with people who actually give a shit. this may come off as selfish sounding, but you have to remember to reciprocate and be a good friend too. if your friend needs a favor, and it's not unreasonable and you can do it, then do it. if you're always there for a friend and they don't reciprocate, then you're just being used. if you're not there for your friend but expect them to be there for you, then you're the one who is a tool.

[SEP]	"a lot of these are about the other person being dicks. but here's one that's not: if they're always agreeing with you/always know about the same band/movie/tv show/game you're talking about. &#x200b; when i was younger i had a friend and if you took him on face value, he liked all the same stuff as me! but he had no insight into them (like, he likes all their songs dude, they're all so good, it's hard to pick just one favourite). &#x200b; many people said he's a liar and to cut him off, he's a bad person, can't trust him, etc. &#x200b; but he was just trying to connect with me, and i guess he felt like he needed to impress me? so i flipped the switch and started modelling behaviour for him. ie ask him what music he's listening to - and even if i have heard it, say ""oh i haven't heard of them, what's some good songs? you should put it on now while we drive"" etc. eventually this gave him the confidence to do the same back - he realised he didn't have to know everything to be cool, that the coolness came from sharing experiences and introducing people to new shit. that the feeling he got of niceness when i'd say ""hey i checked out that show, it's really good!"" also comes with a good feeling for him. whereas to many others in our group he was the ""annoying yes man"" and they'd just reject him and leave him out of shit."

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	we dated for about 6 years, and i thought things were going quite well. when we started dating, she thought she was asexual and so sex wasn't really a main focus in our relationship, which wasn't a dealbreaker for me so i rolled with it. about a month or two before we broke up, i could feel some distance being forged between us. at first i chalked it up to her being busy with a new job and family obligations - but more and more she would reference one of her coworkers. i'd be lying if i said it didn't bother me, but i trusted her completely, so i didn't tell her not to talk to him or anything, and she reassured me that there was nothing going on between them. well, one night we're talking over messenger and our conversation took a pretty serious turn where she basically admitted to me that she didn't think she was as asexual as she thought she was, and that she didn't find me appealing in that way at all. it devastated me, but i ultimately accepted it. naturally, i asked if her coworker had any role in her decision to breakup, which she was adamant that he didn't. not even two weeks later, i find out that the two of them started dating, which *really* made me go into a deep depression. i'm happy to say that it's been a little over a year since then, and i've lost over 130 pounds (and am finally at a healthy weight for the first time in my adult life), my social life is the best it's ever been, i got my degree, and have an excellent new job. at one point i thought my life was over, and in some regards, i was right - my life as i had known it *was* over - but my new life is so much better.

(doing much better now that my insurance actually covers the meds!) and he took advantage of the frequent opportunities. i hadnt noticed but suddenly there was a searing pain and one of my sinus got very puffy. i had taken a couple days off work and eventually went to urgent care where they did the flush. (it was my second time going back there desperate for help) when the two very small balls came out neither the doc or i knew what the fuck it was. doc worried it was a mold of sorts until he broke one apart in his hand and could tell it was small black strands of hair. i was confused and it didn't click until on the cab ride home what it was from. i confronted him which didnt get very far (wrote about that in another comment.) still had lingering pain but it wasnt nearly as bad after. i understand this is hard to believe but at the very least you can confirm the fetish is real with a simple search. sorry for typos, i suck at texting on my phone. edit again: it's perfectly okay to laugh. myself laughing at this is how i coped through it at the time. in the moment i was devastated, totally emotionally wrecked and confused at pretty much every aspect of it. but my friends were great and like ""*dude. what if you had a child and she sneezed? nothing would ever be normal.*"" and they helped me laugh through it all."

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	he ended up being crazier than i initially wanted to believe. years of stalking after our break-up really did turn me into a paranoid freak. but in time i am doing a lot better. lesson learned.	[SEP]	472

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	because i could predict the entirety of the rest of my life and i didn't like it. i would have taken over the family bakery and spent every day waking up at 3 am to make donuts. 9 am would be the start time for sausages. leave the bakery @ 4 pm.deposit the daily sales before the bank closes. drive home and eat the unsold sausages for dinner. watch tv for 1.5 hours before falling asleep in a chair. wake up at 3 am. repeat. forever. there was no joy in her father's eyes. joy left years ago.

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	an 8-year lasagna of me being noticeably depressed, me not making continuous romantic gestures, a long-term sense of complacency on both our parts and both of us gravitating towards opposite directions in life. i dated her for almost a decade (im 25), and our time together made me a better person. im grateful for the time we shared and dont regret it, but ive made my peace and spent nearly 2 years swallowing that bitter, gargantuan pill. i wish her the best and view her in warm regard, but i dont want to be her friend or even cross paths with her ever again. getting over the breakup had to be the hardest thing ive ever done, and picking that scab just to keep up the meaningless platitude of we can still be friends would be a waste of both of our time.

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	stuck in a house with him for four years, somehow got issolated and seperated from everyone i knew. couldnt leave the house out of fear. heard him talking in at least four different personalities to himself. threated rape if i didn't sexually do what he wanted. then turned around and claimed he hadnt said that, that i was confused. killed my pet rat. duct taped my dogs face closed, took pictures and laughed with his friends. finially lied through my teeth to get him out of the house long enough to leave him. got stalked for three years. cut my break lines. i eventually moved states, five times. guess im safe now edit: didnt think this would get so much response. if anyone is concerned and needs help identifiying red flags, or needs advice if they know they're in it and are terrified to get out you can message me seperatly if you'd like. that being said i know its not easy to bring up to anyone, but sometimes its the easiest talking to a stranger.

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	he put his family (and specifically his toxic mother) before me, even over stuff where it wouldn't hurt them to put me first but it did hurt me intensely to put me second. we were married and had been together over a decade. when i finally asserted myself and put my foot down because i was tired of suffering from his lack of care and demonstration of care for me, he began to physically abuse me out of frustration. the day he choked me i packed my bags and went to a hotel and told him i wanted a divorce. it's been two years now and i am a lot poorer and taking care of our son without a partner living with me, or family nearby is very difficult, but i am much happier in other ways. my new partner is a much more compassionate person.

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	because i was an asshole overall. i never took the relationship, or her, serious. i wasted 2 years of her life. the worst part is it took me a while after we broke up for me to realize it really was my fault. i've changed a lot about myself since then.	[SEP]	394

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	"i'll only give my last two to keep it somewhat concise. the woman before my last ex. well she had the unfortunate timing of being with me when my father/best friend died unexpectedly when i was in my early twenties. while we had been together about 3 years, i said fuck the world and turned into an alcholic and moved 2000 miles away. i actually feel bad for her. queue 6 months into my self destructive path i am sleeping with this girl(on the wrong side of the crazy/hot scale) pretty much daily, but i have made it clear it is a fwb situation and i am not interested in a relationship with her. that didnt work for her. but idgaf so i keep putting my dick in crazy and drinking (hindsight is 20/20). so when i start casually dating another woman on the side 6 months later she(crazy>hot) is pissed and takes it out on my vehicle and with a bout of stalking. that ""other woman"" somehow stuck with me, got me help for my drinking, helped me move past the loss of my father and some moderate ptsd from the military; then became my wife and mothered my children. i dont know what i did to deserve her but she literally saved my life and i'll never be able to repay her."

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	he was an abusive, drug addicted alcoholic who would drug me and who literally gaslighted me into multiple psychotic breaks. one day, after he shouted at me in front of his friend after i begged him to close the door so his friend wouldnt hear him, i just snapped and screamed and shouted in his face just to fucking stop. and then he was the one that broke up with me, he turned to his friend and said shes a fucking psycho. and that was that. it was my first relationship and it has really done a number on me and how i perceive normal relationships. im still trying to come to terms with it over a year later. edit: i really didnt expect this to get any upvotes or to get the support that i have done. i just want to say thank you very much for all the well wishes!

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	he constantly belittled me because he was jealous of my success. he had no ambition or job. he thought having a homosexual affair outside of our heterosexual marriage shouldnt count because at least he came home at the end of the night. it was all my fault because i visited my family once and he was lonely.	[SEP]	183
[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?	[SEP]	i had been considering breaking up with her for a while because she would lie about little things that made no sense lying about. never cheated or anything, but would do anything so that she would get more attention from me and other people. i started noticing this when one night she sent me screenshots of her text messages between her and her dad. i had known her dad for a while and the things he was saying in these texts were awful. they were things like youre worthless i wish you werent my daughter they were things he would never ever say. if there was one thing he showed was how much he loved his two daughters. i was kind of skeptical when she sent me these because he would never say that stuff, but obviously i couldnt just come out and tell her i didnt believe her cause if it was true then id be a terrible person. what i thought was happening was i thought she was changing her contact info and texting herself making it seem like it was her dad who was sending that stuff. anyways, this happens a few more times in the next few weeks and im just there for her trying to be a good boyfriend because theres always a chance it could be true. well one weekend she went to a concert with her friend and after the concert she was drunk and we were facetiming and she told me that i was still in love with my ex. immediately im like what are you talking about why do you say that?? and she responds by telling me that i texted my ex telling her i still love her and she has the screenshot. i told her to send it to me and there it was a screenshot of me telling my ex i love her. the problem was that i never sent that and it was obvious she texted herself saying that because she was drunk and wasnt able to type that out correctly. she made it realistic though, because she even went out of her way to use the exact contact picture i had for my ex which was a very unique dumb picture. the moment this happened i knew the screenshots of her dad werent real and i proceeded to say goodnight and break up with her the day she got back. that is why she is my ex.

[CLS]	why is your ex an ex?

[SEP]	when i was 7 or 8, i would have a reoccurring nightmare that one of my dolls came to life, played with me, and then would try to pull me into my closet with her. id follow her into the closet at first, but then shed show me this little door at the back of the closet, and my heart would start to race. i dont know what it was about that door, but i knew something bad would happen if i went through it. id start to struggle and try to pull away, but the doll was too strong and would start pulling me through the door. at this point in the dream, id always wake up screaming. the worst part was i had night terrors, so sometimes id wake up standing next to my closet. every night before bed, id make my parents make sure there wasnt a little door at the back of my closet. there never was. anyway, i was talking to my mom the other day and this dream came up. im laughing about it and how ridiculously paranoid i was about dolls and that closet, but my mom gets really quiet. she tells me the creepy part of that dream wasnt the doll; it was the fact that there used to be a little door at the back of the closet, but when i was one year old, they remodeled the house and put a wall where the door used to be. theres no way i could have remembered that door, but years later, i kept dreaming about it. none of my friends believe this story, but i swear its true.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	i grew up on a 2 acre home with plenty of trees and room for an 8 yr old to run around. our house also was heated in winter by a wood fireplace, so we would periodically cut down one of our own trees to save money. well for about 2 years, there was a stump less then a foot tall near the house, and at least once a day, without fail, i would see someone standing on the stump. usually it was out of the corner of my eye, but once or twice i looked directly at him. i always looked away quickly, cuz it startled me and he was gone, but my sister says she experienced the same thing. nothing ever came of it tho	[SEP]	613
[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	growing up, i had a friend named adam. he was never able to come out dyeing the day, only right before all of us kids had to go home for the evening. adam lived a few houses over, in a house with an overgrown yard. i met his parents once. they were very strange, didn't smile, and obviously didn't want me there. i remember adam telling me that he was sick, that's why he couldn't play that much. he was a small boy, pale with dark hair. eventually, adam stopped showing up all together. and i eventually moved on, though i do remember going to his house a couple times to see if he could come play, and his dad just gave me this look before closing the door in my face. later in life, i asked my sister if she remembered him. she doesn't, and according to my parents - that house was empty the entire time we lived there. i don't know who adam was, i don't know why i so vividly remember him and his parents. as far as i can tell, he wasn't real - and yet i have perfect memories of him and his parents.

[SEP]	alright, buckle in. my neighbor was dying of a heart condition about 6 years ago. he knew he was, so he was giving away his valuables to people he trusted with them. neighbor gave me his tackle box. he loved to fish. i would see him come home from fishing every day and hed just sit on his porch and skin fish. i just put the tackle box in my closet and didnt really do anything with it since i dont fish. anyways, soon after, he passed away in his home. exactly a week after that, i woke up to the tackle box at the foot of my bed. weird, but my stepdad likes to dick around, figured it was him, so i put it back. the next morning, i wake up, its at the foot of my bed again. so, i ask my stepdad what the deal was, and he had no idea what i was talking about. to test this, i put the tackle box in a spot that he wouldnt find, nor would he attempt to get it. under my bed, all the way in the back against the wall, and i put stuff in front of it to conceal it. next morning, nothing. okay, i guess it was him. didnt give it much thought after that. 3 days pass, i wake up one morning and there it is, at the foot of my bed. fuck. now im starting to freak out. so i did what any rational person would and i went fishing with it. after i went fishing, i put the tackle box away, and it hasnt moved since then. its still there.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	this happened to me last year and i fully understand why no one believed me because it sounds rediculous. every morning, i need to wake up at 5 am to get the 5:30 bus to the train station to go to university. i had to be there by 8 am, but i like to get there half an hour early. to get to the bus stop, i have to walk down this bike path and under this bridge to get to this quiet backstreet road. there is fuck all light on the bike path. this street is dead quiet. the right side of the road is a continuation of the bike path, and the left is a normal footpath with a long green hedge. one morning, i was standing there waiting for a bus and this old women comes walking out from under the bridge. i didn't see her at first because as i said it was pitch black on the bike path. she crosses the road and walks up to me. she asked me if i knew where x road was. i turned to point in the direction of the road she was looking for. i turned back and she was gone. this old women who was walking at a snails pace dissapeared within 3 seconds.

[SEP]	the scariest thing i saw was at the age of 16, i woke up early in the morning (4:30-5-ish am) me and some friends were supposed to go on a roadtrip for the weekend (we had a long af ride to one of the stops we wanted to visit, and didn't wanna be there too late) i look out my window and it's still a kinda dark outside, i walk downstairs and see wet footprints all over the house, and suddenly a big man (like 6'7''. i was around 6'1'' at the time) just bolt past me and out the front door. not really creepy, but i shat at least 5 bricks and bolted upstairs to my dad. nothing got stolen, but things were scattered all over the house.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	about 8 years ago now i was taking a drive out to kansas from the east coast. i was with a friend and we were going out to see her grandparents. once we were about 2 hours from the grandparents house my friend starts outlining standard operating procedures of seeing things in and around her familys home. she seemed a bit panicky when going over everything but i managed to calm her down. im skeptical of everything and assured her that the things she had seen when she was a small child were just manufactured in her imagination. she insisted that the entire family had seen these things with the exception of her grandparents. 2 hours later, we arrive in kansas and im ready to fall over because of the length of time the last leg of the trip took. we are welcomed and grandmother takes me to a back bedroom and just as she about to close the door; she stops, says maybe you shouldnt stay in this room and escorts me to another room. ok, that was a little strange but whatever, im tired. fast forward to night #2 at the grandparents home. its around 11pm and my friend is crashed out on the couch watching tv. im in an adjacent bedroom from which i can see her laying on the couch. i nod off for the night and wake up to a old grey man that bared a resemblance to the grandfather but was not the grandfather standing with his back to me in the doorway looking at my friend sleeping on the couch. i decided i was going to get up and confront the old grey man and something slammed me back into the bed. i tried to get up several more times with the same result. each time i was slammed back into the bed a voice would repeat put a seal on the door finally, i snapped to its 3 am and everything was normal. i must have been sleeping. it was a dream. no old grey man and my friend was fast asleep. so i start pacing around the room trying to decide how i feel about what had just happened. i glance over to my friend her eyes are open and she says you seen it. i say, get in the car, i cant be here right now. we spend the next 4 hours sitting in a walmart parking lot talking about the history of her experiences in that house and comparing to my own. ok, my nerves are not on fire anymore and we are heading back to the grandparents home. we arrive and they are waiting for us inside. i tell them exactly what happened to me and i get yeah, thats strange. we usually do seal our doors with a prayer at night but with all the excitement we just must have forgotten. all the children have mentioned stories of things but we have never seen them. we are sorry you had to go through that. im really not sure what i seen or experienced that night but when i tell people they get that look of skepticism. its obvious they dont believe me. my conclusion is that the experience was indistinguishable from reality in the moment. i dont know what that means but it changed the way i look at things.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	this was 4 years ago. as i was walking on the sidewalk on a busy afternoon, i saw a suspicious boy/man about 18 yo. he was 10 meters away and walking what it looked like towards me. i kept my eyes on him despite the fact that he wasnt looking directly at me, his eyes were roaming jumping from an object to an object. as we approached one another, half a meter away from each other he takes out a knife and tries to stab me in my left side. he wasnt really fast, so i easily dodged it and immediately turn to see who is he, or if he is trying to stab me again. to my surprise he continues walking and after couple of meters he stopes turns around smiles and gives me thumbs up, then he continues walking in the opposite direction. till this day i dont know who he was, what he wanted and even my family doesnt believe me, because if someone wanted to stab you, you cant stop him. you arent experienced enough to dodge it like that and something of that kind. edit: thank you for the rewards! those are my first ones so i dont know what do they do. thank you!!!!

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	i woke up to something, it sounded like a door shutting. at first i thought it was a dream because i could hear it in the dream as i was waking up, kinda like when someone calls your name when youre dreaming. but then i looked at my cat, his hair was completely standing up and he was beaming at my bedroom door. this was the moment when i got really scared bc i know animals can pick up on that shit and i thought he might know somethings wrong. my cat doesnt do this type of thing unless a dog is in the room. so i looked over at the door and the only way i can describe it is it looked like it was swaying, slowly, like it was breathing, like someone was standing on the other side of it trying to hear if i was awake. this swaying was accompanied by a shadow. *i dont mean a supernatural shadow, but it looked like the shadow of a person behind the door. i was paralyzed in fear. i lied there for 5 minutes naked watching this door away. i considered yelling and trying to scare them away but i was terrified someone might respond. i legitimately thought this was the moment where i will have to defend myself or be killed. i dont own a gun but after 10 minutes or so i mustered up the courage to check every room in the house. i fucking checked every corner too. but there was no one there. i dont know what happened, but my evolutionary traits kicked in and i completely believed someone was outside my door. edit: the, accompanied by a shadow part was not a shadow figure, it was like the shadow youd see if something was on the other side of a cracked door. i dont know if that makes the story less scary or what, but just wanted to be clear.

[SEP]	"this makes me sound fucking crazy but anyways: &#x200b; it was a warm summer morning back when i was a kid. i was standing in our hallway, putting on my shoes when i randomly peeked into our living room and saw a see-through male figure surrounded by rainbow coloured light standing right in the middle of the living room. he was reading a book and didn't seem to notice me. i thought it was weird but i didn't feel scared or anything. it felt like the room was filled with a warm, loving energy if that makes sense. i kinda just shrugged it off and went about my day, probably because i was too young to really understand what i'd seen. a few days later when my mom tucked me into bed she read me a bedtime story about a kid who meets an angel or something like that, don't remember the story exactly but what is interesting is the authors description of what that angel looked like. it was exactly the same as the strange rainbow man i had seen in our living room a couple of days before. it even said that angels will often visit humans surrounded by a strong, rainbow coloured lightening and manifest themselves while reading a book*.* &#x200b; i casually blurted out:""*oh, i've seen an angel then!""* and my mom was like:""*you have? that's great!""* and we didn't talk more about that for a while until one day where i randomly asked my mom if i could see a picture of my grandad who died unexpectedly while my mom was pregnant with me.she found an old family album and we looked through pictures of my parents' wedding that happened exactly one year before i was born. there was a picture of three or four people sitting together, laughing and having a great time at the party. i immediately pointed out the guy who sat in the middle and said:*""how funny! he looks just like the angel i saw!!""* and my moms face turned white as a ghost. she was just about to tell me that this was indeed my deceased grandfather who i never got to meet. i'm very convinced it was him visiting me."

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	i spent one summer in high school living with my aunt and uncle and keeping their seven year old daughter for them during the day while they worked. i was up late one night watching tv in the living room. the living room was right off of the kitchen, separated only by an l shaped bar. i saw my cousin, out of the corner of my eye, walk down the hallway from her room into the kitchen. it was way past her bedtime, so i told her she needed to go back to bed. when i didnt hear her answer, i got up and walked around the bar and into the kitchen. there was no one there. i checked under the bar to see if she was hiding from me, and there was no one there, and no where else she couldve gone from the kitchen. i walked down the hallway to her room, and she was fast asleep, snoring, so there was no way it was her. it baffled me, and freaked me out, because if i didnt see my cousin, who was the little girl that walked into the kitchen? several years later, i was talking to my aunt and she nonchalantly brings up the ghost in her house. i laughed it off and she said, no, im serious. we have a ghost. your uncle and i both have seen her and heard her. we call her giggles, because we hear her giggling. we usually only see her in the hallway before she disappears. all of a sudden, i remembered the disappearing girl in the kitchen. i asked her what her ghost looked like. she said she had blonde hair with braids and wore a white dress. my cousin is blonde. on the night in question, i thought id seen my cousin in a nightgown walk down the hallway, but apparently it was the ghost that resides in my aunts house.

""yup, i saw them too"". we look back and they are gone. we decide to aim the boat towards the shoreline. it's not dark yet but sun is going down. we saw nothing. no owls, no goats in the trails. we didn't get off the boat but we had a good look around. when i ask him about it (this was around 10 years ago) he just says he doesn't want to talk about it. i can't blame him. but after all these years i've never heard or seen anything like those glowing red eyes, 30 - 40 feet up in the trees. staring at us. i copied and pasted this next part, i knew nothing about the history when we went fishing there. ""for more than 100 centuries, people hunted and camped along the original shores of lake minnewanka. the stoney people called it minn-waki or lake of the spirits. they respected and feared this lake for its resident spirits. the early europeans called it devil's lake."" i used to go camping there. i do not any more. mostly because it's bear country for most of the summer. but yeah also because of those bright red eyes. i will never forget that. most surreal thing i've ever seen."

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	i used to have a buddy that lived in the same neighborhood, a few streets over. one night we were having a couple of beers in his backyard while playing cards. i had some things to do the next morning so just before ten i said my good-byes and shoved off. it was a short walk (maybe 15 minutes door-to-door) so i never drove. anyway, it was a nice night. uneventful trip. but when i got home, my roommate was coming out the front door, coffee in hand, and dressed for work. he gave me a funny look and said he thought i was asleep since my truck was in the driveway. i told him where i'd been and asked why he was going in to work at night. that's when he kind of laughed and asked if i was drunk. we stared at each other for a minute and then he told me it was just after 5 in the morning and he was going in just like he usually did. in my entire life, i'd never felt more confused than i did in that moment. i could tell he was dead serious but i knew i had just left my friend's house. i checked my phone and sure enough. 5-something in the am. my roommate left for work. i paced circles in the living room for a bit then called the friend whose house i'd just left. he groggily answered and confirmed i'd left at ten the previous evening. i have no idea what happened during those 7 hours of my life and it gives me chills to think about it all these years later. i wasn't drunk, i wasn't tired, no one could have slipped anything in either of the two coors lights i'd had.no known medical conditions that would have caused me to blackout, and nothing has happened like it since. i just don't know what happened to that time.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	two stories here, both about my grandma. near the end my grandma had trouble controlling her bowels, wore a diaper and would typically go all over the toilet. after she passed(she passed in the house under professional care) my family cleaned out the house, took the wallpaper down, cleaned the place spotless, because we were going to move in in the next month or two. about a week after we finished cleaning we went back to make sure everything was good, we get to the bathroom my grandma used and there was literal shit everywhere, the walls, the ceiling, behind the shower curtain, literally the entire bathroom was essentially coated. freaked me out because i knew it had to be my grandma, no burst pipes or anything wrong with the plumbing. second story: we ended up moving in after the shituation. my parents were out of town, so my brother and i had some friends over, we were in the basement playing magic the gathering when i went upstairs to grab everyone drinks. in line of sight from the fridge was the tv in our family room, out of nowhere the tv turns on full volume to the show the commissioner, which was my grandmas favorite show, she was also hard of hearing so it being at full volume was normal for her. i freaked the fuck out and ran into the basement to get my brother, we go upstairs and the tv is off but the recliner is reclined. i shouldnt have been scared because it had to be my grandma, but i young. we lived in that house a few more years and a few other things happened but those two stick out to me because they were so close to when she died	[SEP]	977

[SEP]	i was walking to class from the dining hall on my campus when i saw a lady yelling for help and banging on a window of a nearby building. lots of people were walking past but i was the only one who seemed to acknowledge it. i went to the window to help and she told me she was locked in a room in the building and that she needed me to come in and open the door. now, i have no idea the layout of this building and where she was located. so i decided to call campus security for help despite her pleading with me not to call them and to just let her out. i call them and when i hear them coming i go to greet them so i can take them to the window. i leave for maybe a maximum of fifteen seconds and when i return with campus security she is gone. we can't see her at the window and campus security goes inside to double check and sure enough there is no trace of her. campus security definitely thought i was crazy and i'm sure my professor thought i was full of shit when i explained to him why i was late. no one seems to believe me that this happened but i swear it did. faqs: i am female/it is a very old campus with lots of random historic buildings that people don't really use and this building was one of them/the area has a very high crime rate so it probably was a robbery	[SEP]	26449

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	ok so i was flicking through these and told my girlfriend about one and she hit me up with these stories. just some background she is a dedicated science brain and not superstitious at all. when she was growing up (~4 to ~15 years of age) she would often wake up in the middle of a disturbed sleep to see an old women perched at the end of her bed. this women was not someone that she recognised. the old lady would sooth her back to sleep often patting her feet at the end of her bed. the strange thing about this is her sister (a few years older) also had similar experiences seeing the old lady. they both shared a room, but would see her at different times. we doubt very much it was someone coming into their rooms at night. both her and the sister also recalled seeing a man popping his head out from behind their tall kitchen cupboard, smiling and then going back behind it. turns out that from his description the family believed it was a neighbour who passed away and used to play hide and seek with them and his children. personally, i've never experienced anything supernatural. found reading this thread and talking to her about it very interesting :). edit: thanks for all the votes and comments. one of my first big posts on reddit great seeing the love! we both woke up all giddy. my gf divulged further that the house they lived in used to be owned by and elderly women who kept it super clean and was a very caring member of the community. apparently she died 3 days after they signed the lease.

[SEP]	"this might end up buried but i'm going to add it anyways. i work night shift at a hospital and during the night it's fairly common for us to run out of particular supplies that we need. during the day, there is normally a worker from central supply that you can call and they'll bring up what you need directly to your floor. but at night, we don't have that luxury so we often have to go down and get it ourselves. central supply is the basement of this hospital that has been around since the 40's, so it's creepy enough. i had heard stories about how creepy it was and people getting uneasy feelings while down there alone. i was naive and didn't really believe it until one night i had to go down there by myself. the place is huge and dimly lit with rows of shelves of hospital supplies everywhere. i'm in the middle of these shelves looking for what i need when i just start to feel a shiver run through my entire body. the hair on my neck is standing up and i just get this feeling of complete dread, like i'm not supposed to be there. then all of a sudden i see this black figure dart passed me out of the corner of my eye. at first i thought i was just seeing things because it's like 3am and i'm tired so i brush it off. i go to leave and suddenly i hear a huge crash behind me. a variety of supplies were wiped completely off the shelf and all over the floor and in the corner of the room, i just see this black figure like thing standing there. every hair on my body is standing up at this point and i get my ass out of that place as fast as possible. i came back to my floor and all but one of my coworkers thought i was bluffing. the only one who believed me saw my face and without me saying anything said to me, ""you saw it too, didn't you?"" &#x200b; yeah, i never went down in the basement ever again lol. edit: grammar, inevitably due to writing this during night shift lmfao"	[SEP]	716

"" what is it dear*?"" not seeing her i yell ""where are you?"" again i hear a voice ""i'm over here dere."" i dont see her and call out again. this repeats about 4 times and as i get closer and the voice gets louder. i passed by a window and glanced out to see my mom and dad out in the distance working on a tractor. my heart jumps into my throat and i book it outside. my brothers are exactly where they were when i went in so i know it's not one of them messing with me. throughout the years i hear voices and tv's and strange noises constantly throughout the house but just assume i'm hearing things move up a bit to me being 17. parents left town for a few days and i had some friends come over. night starts off normal we play some video games and all is well. 2 of my friends need to use the bathroom so one goes down stairs and one stays upstairs since theres 2 bathrooms in the house. first friend comes back from the bathroom and says "" yea yes really funny guys"" to the 3 of us that are in the room. we have no idea what he talking about. he said ""banging on the door and making weird sounds while i'm taking a piss, soooooo funny."" we are all genuinely confused as we haven't moved. he doesn't believe us but sits down and rejoins the group. now the second friend comes back from downstairs and has a similar complaint. he says we were bouncing a ball, shuffling things around laughing outside the door and heard us run off when the toilet flushed. we again are confused especially since there weren't enough of us to mess with both of them at the same time. conversation kind of drops but neither seem convinced we did nothing a couple hours go by and for some reason the conversation comes up again. we deny it they dpnt believe it. eventually that turns into jokes a out ghosts and how we disturbed them when the house was remodeled(i was about 13 when we started remodeling). jokes continue and someone said, "" ah come on now you cant really believe that ghosts exist?"" and everyone is like nahh they probably dont. on the other side of the room is a single-fold closet door and right as we said that this door explodes open so violently that the folds slam together and bounce almost back shut. we immediately end that conversation, flip every light in the house on and no one dared to touch that door. the next day i wanted to make sure something didnt fall, but as i open the door there is nothing close to the door a d nothing big enough that even could have fallen to slam that door open. move forward to me being 20 and telling my mom of the weird things that i witnessed. she tells me "" oh i know theres at least a family of 3 that i know of. 2 little boys one always has a bouncing ball and the other giggles a lot and an old man"" i hadn't even gotten to that part in my story. edit:dear* cause apparently this is a hot button issue for y'all"	[SEP]	6058

[SEP]	when i was around 9 or 10, this guy who looked about 40 just kept being in every single public place i was in. with my parents or not, he was there. at the store? yes he was there, bought everything me and my family bought. in school? yes, he was staring at me on the other side of the school gate. out in the city? yes, following me in the streets. i told my parents so many times and they just ignored me and said i need to stop believing everything my brother says. (since my brother was really into creepy stuff at the time, he was 14) one day this guy just disappeared. the next thing i knew was that one of my friends kept seeing the guy everywhere. she many times pointed that the guy was outside the school gate watching her, i never saw him on the otherside of the gate. then she told me the guy disappeared after a few weeks. then this other kid started telling everyone about the guy following him. about 7 months passed and i moved to another town. still gives me creeps. edit: for the people asking what he looked like, he was a ginger head, not really good looking :/ and that's all i remember.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	"about a decade ago, i was helping my sister and her husband move into their new apartment. it was in a far off city, so i couldn't exactly drive home right after we were done, and their place was also pretty cramped. i decided to spend the weekend at her friend's (who i'll call mary) house for my bus back home on monday. now, mary is a widow. i'm also a guy. keep that in mind. when i first got to mary's house, i was immediately hit by how unwelcoming the place felt. she was really nice, but the house just ""felt"" angry, as if i was an intruder. the building was also ice cold despite it being summer and there being no ac. it was off putting to say the least but i just chalked it up to nerves. mary starts to show me around the house, but a feeling of profound unease begins to steadily creep up on me, starting right in my gut. something is seriously off about this place, but i don't know what exactly. one room was her husband's study. it looked completely untouched since what i was guessing was the time of his death: files, books, computer and keyboard, pens and pencils, and even a coffee mug. all of it was covered in some serious dust. the room didn't look exactly ominous but it was certainly bizarre. she finally leads me to the guest room and i start to get ready to turn in. it's about 11 pm. i leave the one luggage bag i brought on the floor, change into my pajamas, lay in bed and try to get to sleep. a few hours later at about 1 or 1:30, i wake up to what sounds like footsteps. i don't worry too much about it, thinking it's probably mary on her way to the bathroom or something. then something hits me like a brick. these footsteps are far too deep and far too loud to belong to mary. they sound like the footsteps of a bigger guy. now, i'm sweating bullets but all i can really do is stay still and try to go back to sleep. for good while, all i can hear is the steady pacing of a large man just outside the door. i swear, at some moments it felt like whatever the fuck it was, was walking right into the room. i eventually fall back asleep. i wake up again at about 3 or 3:30. this time it felt like someone or something was pinning the covers from below the bed so that i couldn't move. i'm terrified and almost paralyzed in fear. after a few moments of struggling, i manage to get the covers off and then the bed starts to violently shake. i grab my phone and fucking take off. i hustle down the stairs in my pjs and call a taxi to get to a hotel since i'm way too spooked to stay any longer. once i get off the phone, i quickly go back into the house to get my stuff from the guest room. i will never forget what i saw next. as i open the door to my room, to my total and utter horror, i see that my luggage has been carefully placed on my bed, opened, and the contents have been completely strewn about. i practically shit a brick, scramble to get my stuff into my bag, and sprint out of the house. i haven't been over at mary's house since edit 1: formatting, spelling, and some extra deets edit 2: i never spoke to mary about this in detail, but she did ask me why i left in such a hurry. i told her that i couldn't sleep since the house was so cold. she clearly wasn't believing me, but we both just silently agreed to let it slide. i'd later find out from my sister (who i also did not tell very much to) that mary's husband had killed himself in the guest room."

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	as a marine, i used to have the graveyard patrol shift at the beirut bombing memorial. part of the memorial is dedicated to a veteran's cemetary. oddly enough i never got freaked out being completely alone in a remote cemetery, in the middle of the night, surrounded by dense woods on all sides. it was actually kind of peaceful, to be honest. however, one night i was patrolling near the perimeter fence where some of the oldest headstones are, when i heard the sound of a woman humming. i followed the sound and noticed a light glowing through the vines and brush of a large tree. as i approached, i could literally feel my hair beginning to lift as if there was an electric current in the air. i pushed aside the brush and what i saw nearly took my breath away. it was an old, weathered headstone with a large cross etched into the marble. only the cross was glowing a bright, vivid blue, like a neon bulb. the humming was also suddenly much louder and had a weird plurality to it, like it was coming from hundreds of voices at once. needless to say, i freaked the fuck out. i screamed like a scared little girl and sprinted back to the parking lot. i radioed the guard who was supposed to relieve me and forced him to come early, then spent the rest of my shift in the cab of his truck. i don't think he believed me, but he stayed in his truck and didn't go out on patrol until the sun was fully up. a few days later, i worked up the nerve to return to the grave (during the day, of course). as i suspected, in the light of day it was a completely mundane headstone. there was no name, only the aforementioned cross. i ran my hands over the stone and checked to see if maybe there was some sort of hidden light source or solar panel, but no, it was just plain, solid, unremarkable stone. the humming was gone, too. i eventually returned to my normal shift, but never again experienced anything out of the ordinary. i never learned whose grave that was, either, but i find myself thinking about it from time to time. it certainly sounds absurd when i say it out loud, and i suppose it could have been a hallucination or a trick of my tired brain, but i don't believe it was. i think it was real; a ghost or spirit of some sort, but i don't think it was malevolent at all.

[SEP]	"this may be long and it isn't a ""no one believes me/us"" scenario due to the amount of us involved, more of ""a lot of skepticism"" thing. back story: (you'll need it) i grew up in a small california desert tourist town called joshua tree. home of the joshua tree national park (those of us that are older call it ""the monument"" as it was that before national parkdom). i was in my early 20's at the time of this, which was approximately 14 years ago, and was the only one with a car and a license. growing up in a small desert town leaves you will limited options for fun and we would make use of the park. occasionally, maybe once a week or so, a group of us would pile in to the station wagon with beer, smokes and a mix tape and drive through the park late at night. an empty road, so dark and quite other than the loud group of guys in a red mercury driving fast from one enterance to another. hours would go by each time as we drove the long desolate road and stopped at various rocks we liked to climb. and i can't understate how desolate it was. how alone. no other cars, no lights. except the occasional road work sign when warranted. hell, that was exactly what we thought it was. this trip started like every other, except maybe more of us than usual. crammed in that car, windows down as i chain smoked and drove a good 20mph over the speed limit, gravel spitting up as we had a good time. shortly in to the trip i saw a light. a blue light. possibly (and it was) miles and miles ahead. that is the thing about dark, light is free to shine. i remember saying something about having to slow down at some point ahead, must be some road construction left by itself up ahead. had to be a sign, the light hadn't moved. we continued for a few miles to one of our favorite stops and got out. we climbed for a while, maybe 45 minutes or so. drank a little. joked. the norm. then we piled back in and continued. let me be clear, this light never moved and we had already been about an hour in to our adventure. why would the sign have a blue light?? as we approached the light i started to slow. and slowed more and more as we approached the source. it wasn't a sign, it wasn't a car, it wasn't a ufo. standing on the side of the road, facing towards us unmoving for over an hour at this point, was a man. a pale white man, white beard, dirty old miner clothing with an old mining helmet and a pickaxe. his light giving off an unnatural blue light. his face blank but he stared at us, directly at all of us. we sped up and as we drove by faster, his head turning to keep pace with us as we left. his light visible, unmoving once again, facing us the entire trip out. i remember looking at the car clock shortly after passing him, it was damn near exactly 1:00 am when we passed him. we never saw a car, hell. a horse, any way for this old sickly pale miner to get in to the park, nor any reason for him to be there. worst of all we estimated that this miner had to have been standing there, facing us, for at least an hour and a half never moving. not once did that light flicker as if he looked down for a moment, or turned his head. he just stood there staring down a road at a car full of dumbasses. we never saw him again. however, a couple of years ago i decided to check to see if anyone experienced the same. i found one other story of a couple that saw him near where we did. standing there, staring late at night. as a man i wish we would have stopped. even if it would have been the most horrifying thing ever, i wish we would have stopped because i honestly believe there was a ghost of a dead miner out in that park and i would know for sure today."

[SEP]	"on mobile, so i apologize beforehand. it's kinda a long one, it'll be my first long post, so i hope you enjoy. tl;dr at the bottom. my mom runs an antique business and has for years. i've worked with her on various occasions, often changing between working the shop with her and doing construction with my dad. for awhile, she ran her business a few towns over with my best friend's dad, and the business was ok, but didn't make enough to support the both of them. well, a few years back, she sold her ownership to him, and just boxed up some of her things from the shop to bring home. my dad, however, surprised her and rented her a building in our home town so she could run her own shop. she quickly brought everything there and began unpacking. while unpacking, i found an old ouiji board from an estate sale she had bought out. i showed her, we joked about the creepyness of it, and she said when she'd gotten it, her coworker had jokingly played with it to tease her (our family isn't super religious, but we ain't about tempting demons lol). she thought he'd thrown it away, but apparently he'd snuck it into her stuff as a final prank. so, we laughed, and she tossed it in the garbage pile. a few months later, i was running the front desk when she brought a box of antiques to price down from the attic. we began going through it and what happened to be in the bottom of the box? the ouiji board, still in it's cardboard case, planchette underneath. i recognized it as the same one (the box had the same tears and dents i remembered). mom and i looked at each other, and after much debating, threw it away. again. well, in about 2017, mom stopped opening the shop (we weren't making too much while open), and instead started buying out estate sales or helping them run it, then buying what was left over to take to the shop (which we still owned). it became a storage house for antiques she hoped to one day sell. this last week (may 20th i believe?) she asked me to help buckle down and clear out damaged junk from the shop. we began going through boxes and boxes and moving them to a trailer to take to a garage sale location. as i was shuffling a box through to the back area to load it, i heard my mother shout, ""no. f***ing. way."" i thought maybe she'd been bitten by a spider or found something valuable, so i set the box down and rushed back to her. what i saw sent a chill down my spine. in the back room where she was, the back wall was lined with shelves, and there were clothing racks and boxes of clothes stacked in front of it. after moving the boxes, the shelves were in clear view. most were cluttered with knick knacks or such. but on the bottom shelf, centered and all alone there sat a familiar board-game sized cardboard box. we stared at it, then each other. neither of us said a word. we pulled it out and sure enough, it was the same damned box. the corners were torn. the sides were scratched. same one. i'd seen it thrown out twice before, yet here it was. we tried to tell my dad, but he isn't superstitious. my brother didn't believe us. they assume it's a separate game, and part of me wants to think so too. but i've seen that box too closely too many times. i know it's the same one. tl;dr - mom opens her own antique shop and we find a ouiji board and throw it out. then find it again and throw it out. then find it a third time and crap our pantaloons. edit: thanks for my first gold! as soon as mom and i decide what to do with the ouiji board, i'll update the post again"	[SEP]	1325

[SEP]	when i was three, we were picking up my grandparents for a sunday drive. i was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side. my grandfather was sitting in front of me. suddenly he keeled over, dead of a massive stroke. as they hustled my little sister and me out of the car and into my grandparents' store, i happened to look over my shoulder and plainly saw grandpa walking down the street with two men. both were dressed in suits, which made it all the more incongruous that grandpa was wearing the same gray sweater and peaked hat he'd been wearing a moment before in the car. there was nothing particularly creepy about the experience, except that i wouldn't accept that grandpa was dead because, after all, i'd just seen him walking down the street. naturally, this didn't go over very well. but i loved my grandpa, i didn't want him to be dead- and i knew what i had seen! when our family doctor arrived to pronounce grandpa dead, my mother asked me if i would take his word for it. we had a very good, trusting relationship with our doctor, so i said that i would. the doctor assured me that my grandfather had in fact died. but he was the only grown up who didn't treat me like i was crazy. he listened respectfully as i told him what i had seen, and he suggested that maybe the men in the suits were angels. this seemed reasonable. problem solved. but to this day i can still see grandpa walking down the street with those two men. and no matter what my parents tried to tell me, it wasn't just a guy who looked like grandpa coincidentally wearing exactly the same clothes he'd been wearing in the car. it was him.

[SEP]	i once encountered what i can only think of to be a skinwalker. me and a friend were outside in a small town in germany, where my friend lived. it was past 11 pm on a summer evening, he would invite me for a sleepover on the 13th august every year, it always was pretty normal and we slept in a tent in his garden.this evening we decided to head to the towns playground to talk about stuff and do some stupid shit like doorbell-ditching. right behind the playground there was a small forrest in front of a big corn field. so after 20 minutes at the playground we hear a really loud scream, not anything human or anything that sounds like an animal, it came from the woods we turned around and saw something glowing brightly on the ground but it was a sphere and seemed almost liquid. we heard something running into the cornfield with fast big and light steps but suddenly the steps changed to a heavy slow trampling and something growled deeply. my friend and i tried to stay as quiet as posible not making a sound for the next 100 meters, then we ran off as fast as we could. i was paranoid the whole way back to his house and felt like someone was watching us. we instantly got in our tent when back at his home staying quiet and watching star-wars with headphones in one ear so that we could hear anything approaching (the ground was covered with leafs and you could hear everything that stepped onto it) our tent. we fell asleep at around 1 am. at 3 am i was woken to something walking in his backyard, i heard that it was bigger but very fast, i silently woke my friend up and we both listened to this creature walking around in his backyard. it suddenly stopped and we heard heavy thin breathing, like an old woman grasping for air. we were both extremely terrified. then again the creature started walking around but it's steps again turned heavy, like a bear or something, that's when all sounds seized for 15 seconds followed by light fast steps running away into the fields next to his house, and a high pitched screech. neither his nor my parents ever believed us. we visited the playground the next day to discover a few dead birds and a piece of wood still glimmering like a campfire that was left behind over the night, at the exact spot where the sphere was. edit: thank you guys for 125 upvotes!

[SEP]	ghost story time. i was living with a few of my friends a year and a half ago and were all pretty religious at least two of us work in religion. we were talking about how we didnt believe in ghosts or demons, at least in the sense that we couldnt see them if they were real. we started talking about how if we saw one it would change our perspective entirely. i said out loud, if something is here i wish it would just show us. two nights later im sound asleep and have the most vivid, brutal nightmare ive ever had. long story short i was in my childhood house, we were getting robbed, and the robber shot my father only it was me (i was the robber). my father and i had a very strained relationship and the detail of the shooting woke me up in tears. i mean i was sobbing. i looked at the foot of my bed and saw a man sitting on his heels staring at me. it looked like he was 80 years old but never hit puberty thats as best i can describe it. his face looked kind but his eyes looked so wicked it struck terror into my soul. he almost looked curious, but morbidly so. he was wearing clothes that looked like he was a newspaper salesman from 1890s new york. i only saw him for a split second and he was gone. the wild thing is i got all of that detail in just a split second, like he wanted me to remember him. heres the crazy part. so i was spooked to shit right? i went into our living room and watched youtube and some twitch streams for a bit until i convinced myself i was just half asleep and still spooked. i lay back in bed and the moment my head hits the pillow my room mate sits straight up in bed (still asleep), points at the foot of my bed and says, _______ (my name), who is that? i lost my god damn mind. i literally drove home at 3am and told my parents through tears i wanted to stay home until summer. i stayed at home for a week or so and then went back. my room mate started having night terrors after that but we moved soon after. ive never been so scared in all of my life. edit: ive had question about my room mates night terrors. the one i saw happened the first night i was back. basically were both sound asleep and he wakes up screaming. i dont mean yelling, i mean screaming. it sounded like an animal in pain, for those of you who have been hunting before he sounded like a dear screaming after being shot. i got down on the floor (he just slept on a mattress) and tried to calm him down but we locked eyes and he started to try to climb over me still screaming. he looked afraid, absolutely terrified. after two or three minutes he stopped all of the sudden, started mumbling and went back to sleep. i was holding his hands and our fingers were locked like when you wrestle and i had bruises the next day because of how hard he squeezed. the next morning i asked him if he remembers waking up screaming and he said, no but i had a crazy dream. you got down from your bed and started attacking me but you were covered in this black sludge. like your face was melting off but it was this tar-like goo that smelled like decay. after that two of my other room mates and i got together and prayed in our room. nothing quite as bad happened after that. some other less entertaining stuff happened like couches being stripped of their cushions and things spilling in the middle of the night. one time a bottle of wine just fucking exploded out of nowhere and scared us to death. thanks for the silver, was my first! edit #2: to be clear, im a seminary student and i work in ministry for high school students. not exactly a youth pastor, but sort of. i dont believe in spiritual healings or anything like that, im much more naturalistic about my beliefs but these things really happened, whether it was a hallucination or genuine spiritual thing i have no idea, i dont like to think about it.

[SEP]	when i was about 8 or 9, me and my brother were laying in bed ready to go to sleep. then all of a sudden our room is illuminated with a bunch of flashing lights. it was probably around 10 pm at the time and we were scared shitless. so the lights go on for a good minute and afterwards, we immediately look out the window to see what it was and we see nothing. no car, no random person playing a prank on us, nothing. so we run to our mom and tell her what happened and she doesn't believe us and just tells us to go to bed and stop making stuff up. to this day me and my brother vividly remember this, bit no one ever believes us.

(i'm 26 now and hes 28). unsure if it was our wild imagination or what. but for both of us to remember, makes me feel it may have happened."	[SEP]	411

[SEP]	"my aunt emotionally abusing me when i moved to her with 16, because my dad was abusing me. it went from bad to worse in a week. and no one believed me what i was experiencing. she had a light bulb installed in my basement room. it had a cable going all the way up to her. whenever she wanted me to come up, she would blink the light and i have to run upstairs immediately. i couldn't finish my last task, like finishing the sentence i was just writing or wearing a shirt because i was about to get dressed. if i wouldn't be there 10 sec after the blink signal i would have consequences reaching from losing internet/my laptop for a few hours/days, or being force fed or having mandatory ""family time"", because i would need to learn respect. family time was me sitting in the living room, not allowed to move or do anything than sit and stare (not even reading a book or writing my diary), while uncle and aunt would belittle me and say hurtful things to me. the signal was happening up to every half hour. i am still sensitive to lights. i didn't want to eat meat for ethical reasons. i didn't make a big thing out of it. i just told her she wouldn't have to buy extra meat for me and i would be okay with the veggies. that's when she started to add bacon pieces and eggs into the veggies. when i had a different opinion than her or her fat loser husband, she would bend my arms so i couldn't move, hold a mirror inches away from my face and let me repeat to myself ""i am a liar. i am wrong. [aunt] is right and i'm a liar."" until she would be satisfied. different opinions would mean stuff like once i came home from school, they wanted to know what i learned today. i was telling them about my philosophy class, and started my sentence with ""so first we assume that humans, as all animals."". ""did you just call us animals? you have no respect! thou shalt not lie!"". this particular argument dragged until the evening. my door to my bedroom was broken, because she kicked it in. i asked her if we could repair it. the answer was no, because otherwise she couldn't just enter because i surely would lock it. the door was always a crack wide open. i asked to get a magnet, so at least it would click close. after a few weeks i got one. i am very skinny and she is very fat and old. i don't like to show my body around, so i like to wear tights when i wear skirts and t-shirt that go all up to my neck, so nobody could see my bones. she would think, that i was making fun of her and feel better than her for having a ""perfect body"". she would force me to strip down in the hallway, where windows were to the street, because i was body shaming her by covering mine up. i wasn't allowed to wear tights. she would make fun of me for wearing my skirts low, so they would cover more of my boney legs. once i was wearing a blouse and was about to leave for school. the blouse was wrinkled so she wanted to iron it real quick. she told me to take it off, so i wanted to go to my room and switch to a shirt until the blouse was ironed. i wasn't allowed to do that. i had to strip to my bra in the hallway (where all neighbors could've seen me). i was holding my hands up to my chest and tried to stand in a doorway, so i couldn't be seen. when she noticed that, she forced my hands down and let me stand in front of our glass door. because i did that for shaming her body, she said, and i shouldn't be so ignorant. she force fed me. i was eating very little, but i never was anorexic or anything. she would cook extra much and let me having to eat more than i could, until i felt like puking. i gained 10kg in a year. that was the time when i tried to be bulemic, but jokes on me, i can't puke. no matter how much i press back there or force my finger or toothbrush down, it doesn't work. i gag a lot, but nothing comes up. believe me, i tried. so i started to drink a lot of alcohol, because i would always puke from that. i ended up in the hospital twice for alcohol poisoning during my time at hers. i started self harm. not cutting. not my arms, because she would see. i would scratch my legs with my fingernails and/or scissors, until i had raw and fleshy wounds. then i would touch those wounds as often as i could with dirty hands so they would get infected and crusty from pus. i wanted to have maximum pain throughout the day. in the summer, it was smelly. during my time there i lost track of all my hobbies. before i read several books per week. i played guitar and piano. i had a very solidly kept diary. i learned a bit of programming myself. i drew so much. i really wanted to go to art school. being called up several times a day interrupted everything i loved. bit by bit i gave up everything and started to just sit on my laptop mindlessly all day, because i was just waiting for the next time it would blink. i ran away two times and lived among some punks in some occupied spaces, because it was better than living in constant fear. i stood behind her with a knife in my hand too often to count. i once lifted it and was seconds away from stabbing her ugly fat back, when she turned around. i told her i want to see a therapist. she didn't allow me that because ""we are not sick"". we, as in the family. because only sick weirdos go to therapists. she didn't allow me to have hobbies. aty parents place i was a good dancer. i was in a dancing group for 4 years and my whole life evolved around it. it was the only place i had friends. my aunt forbid me, because i had to focus on family first. if i would behave, i could join a dancing group. going behind her back didn't work, because she would track my school bus and control that i would be home on time. my school friends often hung out after school. i wasn't allowed to. my school friends would always hang out at this bar every friday. i lived in a village, so i asked my aunt and uncle to drive me there. they did it. i always asked them to drop me off a bit further down the road (like every teenager i guess). after a few weeks my uncle grabbed me by my shoulders, face to face inches away and whispered that he knew i was a looser who didn't have friends. he knew, that i was just just a poor ugly girl drinking alone on that park bench where he drops me off whole night. i moved out when i was 18. all the time i was telling my parents and teachers about what i experience at home. but no one believed me, because my aunt told them i was just a raging teenager. nobody believed me. i know this isn't even the worst what people experience. there are people who had it way worse. i never believed i was abused until my therapist told me it was definitely legit to call it like that. this was the two year of my life, that ripped me of all my joy that was left over from my dad's abuse, and noone believed me. i am very sure this will get buried, but it felt good to write it out."

[SEP]	when i was a kid, i used to stay at my grandparents house a lot. theyve had that house for as long as my mom has been alive, possibly even longer. all i know is that the history of the property is still unknown to this day. anyways, i used to stay in my moms old childhood roomit was called the purple room due to the purple carpet and the lavender wallpaper. it was a pretty big room with a queen sized bed in the middle, and a humongous window right next to it. during the summer i would frequently stay at that house and spend a lot of time in that room. one night, i vividly remember waking up late at night, probably 1 or 2 in the morning, and seeing a puppet show outside my window. i wish i was making this up. they were hand/sock puppets and it looked like it was only performed by one or two people. it was only a shadow of this performance, which threw me off, so of course i assumed i was still a little tired and totally out of it and imagining the whole thing. i decided to brush it off my shoulder and ignore it. oh man, do i regret that. as soon as i turned over on my right side, there in the doorway was a large black figure. it was pitch black out in the hallway, but i could clearly see a figure standing there. my stomach sank and my heart started beating quickly. i was wide awake now. i blinked a few times and i swear every time i did, it got a little bit closer. when it got arms length away from me, thats when i felt my heart stop beating completely and my body turning cold. i swear i could see my breath because of how cold it is. i was able to muster up a scream that woke up both of my grandparents and brother from their deep slumber. my grandma was the first one to come into my room, but as soon as she flicked the lights on, it was gone. never to be seen again. i was sobbing and trying to tell her what i saw, but she just kept stroking my hair and saying i was just having a bad dream. i know that wasnt a dream and what i saw was real. i also believe that this thing that i saw as a child has followed me when i moved to a different state. i was about 6 or 7 when this happened and im 16 now. to this day, no one believes me edit: if youre assuming its a mental illness of some sort; such as schizophrenia or anything else, ive already gotten myself checked on multiple occasions and i am perfectly sane and healthy. :) thanks for all of the concerns though!

[SEP]	"i work night shift at a nursing home. at my first job (5 years ago) the building used to be a school in the 50's. so the set up is already eerie. anyway. there was the usual noises heard in the distance and cold chills every now and then. the faucets in the rooms used to start running water randomly and the lights would turn themselves off and on. but the last straw was one night i felt someone tap me on the shoulder, and when i turned around i saw a silhouette pressed up against the privacy curtain and 2 skinny grey legs in blue slippers at the bottom of the curtain. when i moved the privacy curtain (thinking a resident had wandered into the room) no one was there, even though i could clearly see the outline of the body when i grabbed the curtain to move it. i called in and quit the next day. me calling don's private number: ""hey this is so-and-so. i dont think i'm coming in tonight. actually i'm not coming in tonight. i'm not coming back in any night. i quit. don: ""can. can i ask why?"" me: ""uh. no."" *hangs up. the facility i work in currently is down the street from that place. and one if my current coworkers used to work there. she has a similar story. side note: i also got stuck in the stairwell one time. you have to have codes to get in the doors so the patients can't just open the doors and fall down the stairwell. the keypad wasn't working. i had no phone and i was in tears by the time my nurses heard me banging on the door. surprised i'm still in this line of work."

""i'm from the energy company, you called and i'm coming to check it out."" as hes talking tge other guy gets out the car and we can hear him walking to the back door. my mom tells the guy she didnt call anyone, shes not letting him in. these guys were in street clothes.fyi. the other guy is now trying to force himself in the back door. the guy at the front window jumps on the ledge of the window and starts banging his arms and legs against the window in an attempt to break it. he starts yelling and calling her and i names. my mom grabs the phone and calls the police. now mind you, we will in the inner city on a busy street. people are driving by.and they arent stopping, not are the guys bothered by it. this is a high crime area. it is scary to feel like everyone can see and no one is going to help. as my mom is on the phone with 911, (the guys continue to be loud and yell at us and call names.) a station wagon pulls up in our next door neighbors driveway and sits there for a moment. the door opens and a tall, white man in a suit gets out. he makes eye contact with the guy on the ledge of the window and the would be intruder just stops banging. the pounding at the back of the house suddenly stops (my mom at this time is just hanging up with 911.who claims to be on the way). the men hold eye contact (and the intruder remains standing on the ledge). the tall white man walks to our neighbors house and starts to knock and ring the doorbell. after about 20 seconds of strange silence the man jumps off the ledge and the other guy is now standing by the car. they continue to stare at that guy and silently get in the car and drive away. after they drive away, the man at the neighbor's house comes to our front window.tells in asking my mom if shes ok. she says she is, and he says ""they're gone now, and they wont come back, you guys can stop crying."" he then walks back to his car and drives away.silently. the police arrive (about an hour later.typical to come that long after.since no guns were involved. ) my mom and i tell them everything. they then talk to all the neighbors. they question our next door neighbors; who heard a lot of the yelling, but couldn't see much from the way their windows face our house. but.they have no recollection of anyone coming to their house during this time. no one came in the driveway, no one knocked on the door and no one rang the doorbell. so of course, the police continued to question about this part of the story that was made up. talk about the chills; all my hair stood up when the neighbors claimed no one came over. i can still see that station wagon driving away. it seems like time stopped; the guy even waved as he left. but.i cant remember what he looked like at all. i have a great memory for faces.but his is just a white spot.weird. remains one if the scariest things memories i have; and we still talk about that guy. where did he go????? saved our lives."

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	it was afternoon in the middle of summer. i was delivering soda to an old mental hospital that was in the process of being shut down. my call sheet didnt say which of the several buildings i should go to so i was trying doors on all of them until i got one that opened. the building that did open was the crappiest looking so far; it was missing bricks, and looked somehow just darker than the others. like it suddenly wasnt such a sunny summer day anymore. i was ready to get suddenly shanked by modern day sarah connor as i walked down this empty hallway trying to find.anyone who worked there. finally found someone and got their liquid diabetes order into their break room. by this time id been there an hour and really had to pee. i asked the lady if i could use theirs and she pointed me down the hall. there was one of those sudden wall and floor style changes right before the bathroom like you get in old buildings where an addition is made way later. the bathroom is on the old side, darker and colder than the side where the break room was. i really have to go though, and as a woman in a male dominated industry id peed in more awkward circumstances, so i walked in. its a one toilet deal and i locked the door behind me after finding the light switch, because there was no window. i sat and started the stream before realizing that it was a combo toilet shower room, with the shower recessed into the wall right in front of where i was sitting. all dirty institutional tile with an old, old school set of fucking chains and manacles for uncooperative patients bolted into the wall. it was the creepiest thing id ever seen. and as i peed and stared those fucking chains started swaying back and forth on the goddamn wall. yall, do your kegels because i cut off that stream while i was standing and pulling my pants up so fast i broke the sound barrier. the chains were still clanging around while i was struggling with the rusty old deadbolt on the door of that godforsaken, haunted-ass ancient lunatics bathroom. i ran down that hallway out to the truck fit to start crying, and i was not any kind of stranger to weird haunted things like that. it somehow scared me worse than growing up in a ghost-ridden house ever did. mental hospitals being decommissioned, never again.

[SEP]	"\*\*\*edit\*\*\* thanks everyone for reading my experience. as i figured, a lot of people wouldn't believe it (thus the theme of the thread.) little follow up to what all i can remember is that my dad instantly switched from working nights to working days so he could be home at night if anything else happened. a few months later my parents finally saved up enough money to move into a much better neighborhood. ever since i moved out of that area i never had any problems, other than the night terrors, since then.i will post a picture of the house below. mind you the surround houses drastically changed in appearance over the past like 20 odd years, but the old house still remotely looks the same. (its the puke green colored house) [https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8](https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8) only my mom ever believed me about this, unfortunately she is no longer alive so i cannot ask her for anymore details than what i have been told while growing up. my dad just never wants to talk about what happened. i used to live in this rented house near an appliance store from birth up until i was six years old. i am 24 now and out of the military, if that tells you how long ago this was. since it was a small house and i was the younger sibling, and my dad worked nights, i ended up sleeping in my parents room until we moved out. it should be noted that one side of my bed was against a wall, and the other facing the doorway. i remember having this cookie monster plush that i was obsessed with and would never go to sleep without it. if my mom ever tucked me in without it i would throw a tantrum until i had my best friend. things started to change when i was about to turn four though. my mom would wake up and notice i would be sleeping without the plush and that it would be under my bed. not thinking much of it, she would just put it back in my bed and let me continue sleeping. this kept going on for a couple of weeks until my mom finally decided to ask me about why cookie monster would always be under my bed when she would wake up. i remember saying something along the lines of ""he is my friend, he talks to me and likes to walk around at night."" or something of that matter. from my perspective, i knew i was talking to cookie monster because i could see his eyes. you know how he has those big white eyes that stick out. he would talk to me at night and help me go back to sleep when i was scared. my mom played it off as my overactive child's imagination, but it slowly was about to get worse.over the course of the next couple of months i would have night terrors. no, not simple nightmares. i am talking about full blown night terrors, so bad to the point i would stiffen up and do nothing but scream as my mom tried to rock me back to sleep. this went on for almost every single night.they were so scarring on younger me that to this day i remember what they were about. i would be laying in bed at night when my cookie monster plush would came to life, drag me out of my bed, and pull me under it to eat me. shit, i never stopped getting these dreams until i was 14 that is how scarring they were. about a year from moving out of the house and into a better place, my mom would learn the truth behind the whole ordeal. she woke up to some noises one night and heard me out in the living room talking to cookie monster. now you might expecting that i am going to say she saw me talking to the plush, but you are wrong. you might expect me to say that i was laying in my bed and only the plush was out in the other room, but you are wrong. but reality is much, much scarier than any fictional story. what she saw instead, is much worse than any paranormal activity shit you could ever see in any move theater, for instead of a possessed doll, she saw me standing there, talking to the dark.my mom instinctively turned on the light and as soon as she did, two old guys went running out of the now wide open front door.the only thing i remember from that night was my mom holding onto me for dear life as my dad and the police rushed to the house.the thing that scares me to this day is not the fact that i was talking to two random strangers that night. what scares me to this day, is that i was talking to these people for months without knowing it. i was talking to the people who were constantly breaking into my house every night. that they were breaking in for months without kidnapping me, or stealing anything from us. what scares me to this day is that i still have no idea what they ever planned to do."

[SEP]	maybe less creepy and more of just flat out weird, but one christmas morning many years ago my friend and i decided to meet up at a park just to hang out. now this park has a clear view of a very major highway and unsurprisingly it was empty. maybe one or two cars every 7 minutes or so. however, at one point cars just stopped coming entirely for like a 30 minute period and out of the blue a horse drawn carriage makes its way down the highway. my friend and i kind of look at each other to confirm that we were both seeing it, and yes it was real. mind you this is socal so this isn't a common occurrence at all, but we brushed it off as maybe a quince celebration or something, so we get up and start walking back to my house. suddenly we look up and a parachuter is dropping down a decent distance away. no plane in sight, and no logical landing location. we both stare at him for a while before continuing to walk, a few seconds later we both look back to see how our man up there is doing and he's gone. we confirm with each other that yes we both saw him and yes he seemed to have disappeared. as we walk, puzzled, a car drives by. no problem there, we were in a neighborhood at that point. however, he turns a corner and just pure silence. we were maybe 10 feet from that corner so logically we should have at least heard it go into the distance, but we didn't. it turned the corner and just was gone. we ran to see it, and there was no trace. i'm pretty sure we were in some sort of alternate reality there.

[SEP]	i used to do this as a kid, but id hallucinate stuff like shadows arguing or corner of my eye people. i know the things i see arent real and cant hurt me, but it still doesnt change the fact that im terrified shitless of them. the scariest one was reoccurring. its more recent and im chalking up its creation to me being stressed out. it would perch on my table and watch me from across my bedroom. its always dark but i know that if i can see it, it can see me. when id say something about it, everyone would laugh and say that i was nuts/i was cursed. i havent seen it in a few months and idk if itll come back. edit: today i learned, i might have a brain tumor or (more popularly) schizophrenia. guys, i really appreciate your advice. i just dont want to have an evaluation only to get a whole bunch of mental illnesses stamped on my forehead. edit #2: im aware of the things that might be wrong with me. thank you for your insight and most of you have been helpful. i am looking into what i should do in terms of getting this whole thing figured out.

[SEP]	i went to a non-religious highschool in the uk. i was always a nerdy kid who the teachers liked so often got given tasks like delivering papers to other teachers or to bring sick kids to the nurse. basically little jobs which meant i was walking around the school occasionally outside of class times. for about a month or so i kept seeing this nun walking around the school when nobody else was around. i'd get back to class and tell my mates but they all thought i was taking the piss. i asked a few of the teachers and they just openly laughed at me saying we don't have nuns at the school. it became a massive running joke with a lot of people in my class that i kept seeing nuns that weren't there. i even saw the bloody nun when i was with my friends once and pointed her out and the walked around the corner. my friend just missed her and we couldn't find her after running after the nun. one girl later said she also saw the nun but still people didn't believe me. over 10 years on i'm still bitter. fuck that nun	[SEP]	72

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	finally- my chance to shine! so, i live in edinburgh in scotland which has, naturally, rather a lot of old buildings. when i was four my family moved into a victorian villa that was built in 1860. lovely place, beautiful big garden - happy days! that was, until what i like to refer to as the incident of the window. so, one afternoon small me was sat under the window in the ground floor living room playing with some barbis. mum is in another room, and no one else is in. no-one else should be outside either, may i point out! but lo and behold, i look up to notice someone walking along the front of the house toward the window i am sat under. panic ensues at this point, but its hard to describe. while i was definitely a shy child, i wasnt terrified of general people in the public sphere. all i can remember is this really strong feeling of wrongness, so i dipped behind the armchair that faced away from the direction the gentleman was walking and hid. after a bit i peek around the side of the chair to see if its safe to come out yet, and see a man passing the window. he lifts his hat at me and smiles, then continues on his way. i howl for my mum! after a mad dash through to the sitting room, and my garbled explanation of the problem, she goes outside to obviously find nobody there. she checks our wash house, the summer house and the garage but they are all free of middle aged men in jaunty hats. she assumes someone has come down the drive, which is long and cuts around the side of the building with a separate entrance, assuming it was a short cut off the street and left when they realised their mistake. adult me finds this story pretty implausible but heyho, we say what we need to to placate kids eh?! and in the past a couple of people had made that mistake, only they realised and turned back / apologised long before reaching the far windows! anyway, i am assured its nothing to worry about and go back to days whiling away the merry childhood hours doing random crap in this room by that window. however!! later in that same week the *same man* appears again! (how bad aaare his directions, you might well ask). this time mum and i are alone again, but with the important difference she is doing the dishes in the kitchen next door and is stood in front of the window: looking out. she has seen nobody go past, but at my shout of that funny looking man is back! she bolts out the door in a flash - to find absolutely no-one there. a fact she already expects because she has seen nobody go past the entire time she has been in the kitchen. again, she checks all the out buildings - and finds nothing. once again she attempts to reassure me that it is probably nothing to worry about; that it probably wasnt the same man and that they will put something on the drive to make clear it isnt a passage for the public. i insist doggedly to anyone who will listen that this was the same man, and that he looked funny. eventually my grandma, who is a big believer in the supernatural, came to stay with us and the whole incident is brought up. by this point i no longer willingly go anywhere near windows on that side of the house and live in general terror of people looking in at me. she asks me to describe who i saw. at this point i feel i should mention how utterly obsessed with the victorian period i was for my entire childhood. i was forever playing olden days set then, i had loads of dressing up clothes of it, and collected lots of childrens tv or books set in, or about, the period. you can probably see where this is going, but i described a victorian mans get up, which my grandma recognised instantly. she said she thought it was the old gardener by the style of dress i explained, down to the hat, and that she thought it was just his way of letting us know he was happy a new family had come to live there. her and my mum thought that was a lovely heart warming tale, but i have spent the rest of my life terrified of it - meanwhile anyone else who ever heard the story either believes the same man stupidly walked down that drive by mistake twice in one week, or that i fell asleep and dreamt it. twice in one week tho? ** edit: just clarifying, i realise people do have recurring dreams. its the notion of me falling asleep, while sat on the floor next to a table playing with toys, twice at a random time of day in a week that i would say is unlikely to me! also, not saying it was def a ghost. it was just really weird / unsettling!

[SEP]	when i was a wee child, when i was still put down for naps, every day a shadow man would pop out from the end of the bed as soon as my mom left the room. it would pop up and do a little hop before just standing there, as if it was waiting for me. it had no face, or any other discernible features other than the general body structure of a man, with it's entire being simply a flat, opaque brown-grey shadow. despite this, it would stare at me. each and every day, for the duration of my nap. when it started i would call frantically for my mom, but she would never come to save me. as time went on, however, i grew used to the shadows presence, though never comfortable with it. i never did fall asleep with it there. it never harmed me, or even acknowledged me beyond the staring. it would, however, occasionally wave, as if saying goodbye to something on the other side of the bed. occasionally there would be 2. sometimes both on the same side, and sometimes on opposite sides. they were practically the same, *different* at the same time. they never acknowledged each other, just *me*, though when they were on opposite sides they would stare at each other in addition to me. as i grew out of naps i stopped seeing him/them. i still live in the same house though and i know they are still there. as i've posted this story in the past redditors have suggested everything from faes to sleep paralysis. all i know is i saw something and it's fucking terrifying.

[SEP]	back in 1999 when i was twelve, i saw an explosive light in the night sky. i was in a grocery store parking lot, and i didn't even think to look up until i noticed other people pausing in the lot and gazing upward. it looked like a flower of fire, spreading out slowly and burning bright. from our view, it was twice the size of the moon at its maximum spread. it then began to fade, but it was an eerie kind of fade-out that didn't register until it was completely gone. it could have been any sort of natural space phenomena, a rare spectacle of our galaxy bent on relativity and such with nothing to do with ufos or ball lighting or whatever. every time i tell people, though, they just smirk and shake their heads at me, even though there are crazier stories out there with less/no witnesses.

[SEP]	so yeah, got a couple. over the course of maybe two weeks in a new house my family got a lot of paranormal activity. first was my older brother who saw a middle aged man fron the 60s looking outside the window , just floating in the living room, no legs. my mother often heard a very young girl run all the way across the corridor at night, and converse with my very young brother (also, when she appeared, the trap used for going into the attic (which is realllllly heavy) was completely opened). i saw a shadowy figure climb the stairs with me one day, but it wasn't mine since i eventually stopped, but the shadow climbed two more stair before turning his shoulders towards me as if he was saying : the hell you waiting for? i also heard a big scary mean voice kinda scream something completely intelligible in my ears, and thats it. felt in danger for like 6 hours straight, wasn't fun. we eventually found out that the first man in the living room was the deceased cousin of my grandma (motorcycle accident) thanks to a photo of him that my brother recognised immediatly. everything stopped after 2-3 weeks strangely enough.

[SEP]	"i'm posting from my mum's perspective as i never personally saw what she saw, but i was the only one who believed her. a couple of years ago my mum ran a hugely successful cleaning business in england, and based on her location most of her clients were based in the countryside in huge houses ( biggest house she had to clean was a mansion with over 100 rooms to give you an idea of the scale of these houses) anyway, one of the houses she cleaned was a huge bed and breakfast that was converted into a huge house. this house is estimated to have been built sometime in the 1700's ( not that uncommon in the english countryside) the family there consisted of a husband, wife and 3 kids between the ages of 3-5. a very important detail is that one of their kids died at teenager age, maybe 14 based on pictures (mum never asked how, she felt too disrespectful to ask) the husband was a bit strange, anti social, career focused. he was mostly at work so mum and i didn't see him often. the wife was maybe mid 20's, very chatty and friendly and she loved her kids. the fact they were such a normal family makes the events of this story worse. so, mum was asked to clean the 3 floors of the house. however, the wife told mum that on the 3rd floor is where the guest rooms are and they collect a lot of cobwebs. (old house, completely normal) and so they only need cleaning once a month. this is where things get weird. she was given strict instructions not to enter the room 3rd along the hallway on the 3rd floor. that was their dead sons room and they want it left completely alone. okay, sure. the first time she did the new cleaning job at this house, she came home early in absolute hysterics. now, this is a woman who was a carer for years, she's held many dead bodies and guts in her time. so not a lot affects this woman, she's a tough mum. i've never seen anything affect her like this day she came home. she said as soon as she climbed those stairs to the 3rd floor, everything went quiet and freezing cold. chalking it up to old creepy house, she pressed on. she opened up the door to the hallway that leads to the 6 guest rooms. upon walking in, the 3rd and 4th door opens inwards and she hears a young child giggling, and a child on a tricycle comes out the 3rd door and wheels round to the 4th. my mum dropped the hoover and ran the fuck out of there. she asked her other employee to come up with her. they didn't see the boy again, but the atmosphere was still there. they peeked into the 3rd room (my mum has huge balls and morbid curiosity that overrides her fear) and she said it looked like a murder scene. there was dried brown blood on what looked like a normal kids room, on the covers of the bed, the carpet etc but she said the worse part was turning to the wall and seeing ""help me"" scrawn into the wall in fresher blood than the rest. mum and employee got the fuck out of there. they immediately went downstairs to the wife, and just as she was about to say "" i'm not cleaning the 3rd floor at all, you need to find someone else."" the wife looked to her and said "" i can tell you went up to the 3rd floor, i understand you don't want to clean up there, none of the cleaning companies we've hired will go up there. we usually do it ourself. "" upon hearing this story from mum i was thinking hoooly shit. i dont understand how this family uses those rooms as guest rooms! as in, friends and family stay in those rooms over christmas etc. a few months later, she was scheduled to do that house alone, she practically begged me to come along. now it's not uncommon i helped out at the time because i loved her and supported her business but in all honesty i was shit scared. she even had to offer me payment before i considered. so upon arriving i immediately hate this house. huge long driveway, massive courtyard in front of the house. old rotting wood supports, all windows facing outwards towards the courtyard where we park the van. i can see those 3rd floor windows and i am extremely nauseous. the 3rd floor windows are completely black, but my mum was certain they didn't have curtains. oookay. so, i start cleaning, and the first thing i noticed is that there are hidden cameras everywhere. i mean, fucking everywhere. maybe mum didn't spot them because she doesnt know what's she's looking for ( she's a bit old bless her) but i could see little glowing lights where they were on and recording, they were very well hidden mind you, i can't be certain i found all of them but in the whole house i counted 130 cameras. 130. one hundred, and fucking thirty cameras have been recording mum and all her employees ( including me) for months. what the fuck. upon this discovery, i immediately told mum and she went apeshit at the wife, who was the only person present. mum hated being filmed while doing her job, and it's not uncommon people record cleaners to make sure they don't steal, but not 130 fucking cameras. this is where the story gets worse than that creepy upstairs. the wife had no fucking clue what we were on about. what the fuck. we went around the house and i pointed them all out for mum and the wife. the wife was gobsmacked at this. we had to leave for the day as we had finished, and the wife said she'd have words with her husband when he got home. so. the next week i come with mum again and as soon as we greet the wife we know something is very wrong today. the wife is teary eyed and has a weak voice. she asks us to sit down in the kitchen for a talk. she says she confronted the husband and found out a lot of things. firstly, all these cameras went to a random, locked room where the husband had a mini cctv setup where he held all the footage, and he was forced to show the wife what recordings were stored. ooh boy. there were thousands of trimmed videos of my mum cleaning, bending over, working and were extremely perverted, not only that, but he saved recordings of his own kids undressed in their rooms. oh my god i felt so sick hearing this. she said she was going to the police when he goes away on a trip to avoid more confrontation because she was scared, she was also packing up her and the kids stuff to move to her mums house. she begged my mum not to ever come near the house again and she will pay her to keep this quiet. ( i guess they had a reputation in the area and didnt want word going around? not sure how you can keep that shit safe??) to this day, mum and i have never said a word about what that wife said to us. she said she wont accept any money for bribery, and she will never be in contact again, and that was that. we went in the van, went home and had lunch. we both didn't want to speak and felt so sick. we still haven't spoken about it in full. bonus, we drove past that hellhole house about 2 years afterwards and we saw a new family playing in the gardens outside the front. myself, mum and that employee are the only people who know what we saw. mum tried telling the story of the room to the rest of the employees and they laughed as if it was a ghost story. she never mentioned that weird fucking husband. sadly, these things are much more scary when it's for real. fuck. tl;dr creepy house with a young family, their child died and they kept his room as it was which was covered in blood, saw the boy riding a tricycle upstairs. even worse, the husband had cameras planted around the house and had recordings of my mum cleaning and his own children undressing. we got the fuck out of there and never saw them again, new family moved in and house is back to normal.

[SEP]	in december i was back visiting my host family in the us. my host brother and i went to an outlet center, to pick out some new clothes. i was just minding my own business, when out of the blue, a black labrador came running at me. while petting him, i couldnt stop noticing, that it looked a lot like my old labrador back home. he even had the same white spot under the belly. eventually it ran back around the corner, and we continued shopping without thinking about it. fast forward a couple of hours, i get a call from my real mom back home. she was crying, and she told me theyve put down my labrador(he was very sick), a couple of hours before. i still believe he came back, to say his goodbyes.

[SEP]	when i was four i fell asleep on the couch next to my mom. i woke up later in the night and the television was static and silent and lit up the dark room. i saw a woman walk out of the basement and into the kitchen. she turned to me with her finger to her lips to tell me to be quiet. she slowly walked to the other side of the room, motioning me to follow her. when she turned the corner where i could not see her, i woke up mom who told me i had a bad dream. this has always stuck with me and it happened in the 70s.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	when i was about 12, i was in a living room with a bunch of family members. people talking, music playing, even the front door was open so you could feel the air flow and hear the noises outside. all of a sudden everything went still and quiet, like time itself froze for everything but me. it took a second or two before i clued in that something was wrong, and i could see people around me looking exactly as they did, even with my grandpa in the middle of a story with his mouth wide open. i walked a few steps forward to try and figure out what was happening and really to just see if i even could move, and then like a switch it all started back up again. absolutely no one believed me and i don't blame them. to this day i've only told maybe three or four people in real life and i've lived a long time since then.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	this is going to get lost, but here it goes. i was probably about 7 or 8 years old. my room was at the end of the hallway with the stairs to the attic right outside my door. the way my bed was positioned, i could see the bottom of the stairs and clear down the hallway. well one night i flip over, and i see the legs of a woman sitting on the stairs. she wore a long dress and dress shoes. i covered my head with the blankets until i ended up falling asleep. a few years later, i'm playing spiderman 2 in the guest room on my gamecube. i saw the shadow of a woman in a dress and a veil walking along the wall. just as it disappeared, some toys from the toy box fell over. there was nothing that should have made a shadow like that. there was only one window, but it had a garbage bag over it because my dad slept there when he worked overnight (the bag blocked out the light). after i graduated high school, i moved out to indiana (this all occured in pennsylvania). i met my wife there and we have a daughter. well last thanksgiving, we came to visit my parents for the holiday. we slept in the guest room, and after the first night, my wife said she got a bit creeped out last night. when i asked why, she told me she woke up and thought she saw a black figure standing over me, but it disappeared after a few seconds. remembering my childhood, i asked her what it looked like. she described exactly what i had seen as a child. a woman in an old long dress and a veil. i had never told my wife about the woman i saw growing up because i brushed it off as the imagination of a child. now i'm not so sure.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	this happened to me when i was about 14 years old. i and my friend were really into photography at the time and we woke up early to shoot empty streets in the morning sun. we were walking on a small street filled with family houses, nobody was around except us and that blue-soft morning light was giving a pretty dreamy look to everything. (i can't give a more accurate description in english sry) anyway. we came around one corner and we could clearly see one of the houses on fire. whole house burning down at once. we have both seen it. we both felt the heat, heard the terrifying sound of a giant fire. we panicked and called the firefighters. gave them coordinations of the house and everything. but as i said, we were 14 and really scared so we both gave up on waiting for the firefighters thinking that staying near the house would just bring us trouble and we ran away in panic. next day we came back to see how did the fire damaged the house and guess fucking what. everything was normal. no sights of fire or damage. we were discussing what could possibly cause that for like 15+ minutes until we have decided to knock on the door. middle-aged women opened them and got pretty pissed when we told her about the fire. she thought we were just teens trying to be funny. later we got into huge trouble for bothering the fire brigade. to this day we are both sure we saw that exact house on fire. but officially that house never burned or any different house in that area.

[SEP]	it's neither my scariest nor creepiest i've seen and since i've two friends who saw the same thing, i certainly have someone who believes me but it still is my most prominent thing i remembered in my first year at the middle school till these days. it maybe past five and school's over so does my playing around behind the home economies building. with my two friend who heading home in the same direction as mine, we simply walk across the all-purpose field, which have a huge flag pole in the middle, to the school gate. while doing that, i don't know why, maybe because of the flag or something caught my eyes, but i looked up and on top of that pole sat a man. he looked elderly small, dirty, clothes and all, and have darker skin than most i've seen in that day. at first, he look ahead but suddenly turn his head and lock his glares at me. as soon as i saw that i just picking up my speed and almost got up to sprint at the time i make it out of the school gate. and like all protagonist in the horror films, the young me have to glance back to check only to made an eyes contact with him. after that i ran till out of breath and then realized that, strangely enough, my two friend were ahead of me all those time, sprinting and all. turn out, they also saw the exact same thing but too scare to tell me. but that is the first and last time i ever saw him. as a citizen of a mostly superstitious country, he is some kind of the school guardians, watching and making sure that the kids got out of the school safely, or so it seems.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	two years ago, i moved out into rural indiana with some of my best friends to share a pretty large apartment that was above my best buddys dads garage. since most of my family is from the area, most of them have known about the house their whole life and all of them pretty much unanimously agreed that it was haunted. before my friends dad moved in, the place had actually been a church. one wing was the actual chapel and the other was living quarters. my mom said multiple exorcisms had been done there and she once watched the double doors to the living quarters fly open and something stomped down some stairs, all during an exorcism. hell, even when i got there, my other friend i was living with showed me the unused concrete basement and in there was a room that seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, bigger than a closet but smaller than a typical room. the only thing in the room was a symbol painted on the middle of the wall that gave us bad vibes. we googled it and turned out to be a symbol that represented some demon who preferred taking childrens souls or some shit (cant remember exactly what it was). anyway, its 1 am and all my roommates are asleep and i decide im going to go outside and smoke some weed and look at the moon and listen to some radiohead to relax myself after work. usually i take our pitbull pup, sweetie, with me and go around the back of the garage towards the forest. sweetie is so well trained that she will stick to you without a leash and typically scares off packs of coyotes that lurk around. however, as im walking towards the forest, sweetie stops and starts whining and wont follow me like she usually does so i tell her to come on but alas, sweetie refuses to go. i take her back to the apartment and have her sit in my bed and she is *shaking* at this point, but stupid me decided it was okay and went back around the garage outside and started walking towards the forest again, but this time i noticed something was walking alongside me (pretty much directly next to me) in my peripheral. i just kept going until something clicked in my head that said you did not imagine that and i turned to see what was next to me. i shit you not, what i saw was a white figure that was as tall as my waist, and it was wearing a dress, then something whispered in my ear and i took off running into the huge backyard area where i usually smoke. but wait, theres more. after smoking a bit and listening to in rainbows for the thousandth time in my life to calm me down, i decide i had to of imagined it and sweetie probably just saw a coyote that was bigger than usual. i decide im done and ready for bed. i had pretty much forgotten the white figure, so i decide ill head back the way i came since its the faster way back to the apartment. this is where most people dont believe me because i was high but in all of my years of smoking weed, i have never experienced something like this. i started walking into the huuuuge open area that has the forest behind it and i saw something running in the darkness. curious me kept watching to see what it was and i could make out two legs and that it was pretty large but full on sprinting. when i noticed that this large, hulking shadow person thing was full on sprinting towards me though and beginning to show itself in the moonlight, i booked it. i could hear something following me all the way back until i got to our door. my friends have told me some of their stories too but no one believes the last part of mine. i know what i saw and i know it was real. weed has never made me hallucinate, i wasnt so tired that i was imagining things, and ive never had this happen to me again after this event. that shit fucking happened.

[SEP]	when i was about 4/5 i was spending a week at my grandparents house. there was a sort of small shed in the front yard that they used to keep brooms and the odd gardening stuff, and one day i saw that it was unlocked and slightly open (it was usually shut). i went and opened the door more and there was an old man inside. he was dressed in a white shirt and pants, had a long beard, and just kind of stood there in the shed. he didnt say anything or even look directly at me. i ran back inside to tell my grandparents, but when they went outside he wasnt there and didnt believe me. the only evidence was that the shed was unlocked. i had nightmares about that old man basically every night i stayed there from then on. the fact that he didnt seem fazed at all when i opened the shed door and saw him is what freaked me out the most.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	when i moved into my new apartment, my mom gave me her fathers trunk from the vietnam war, which i used as a tv stand. my mom has always lied to me about how he died in the war, however my father enlightened me as to how he committed suicide shortly after he returned home. my mom said she always how she never wanted the trunk and how she always felt odd having it, and told me to get rid of it. but i insisted on keeping it. fast forward to me getting a roommate. i tell him the story of my grandfather and the trunk. he asks if we can go through it, and i said sure. we figured out he killed himself after receiving multiple letters from credit unions regarding credit card fraud. to this day nobody believes my roommate and me, but two hours after we go to bed, i wake up to the absolute deafening blare of an ambulance siren. i mean it gave that uncomfortable rattling deep in your ears that industrial fire alarms do. in a panic i cover my ears and leap out of bed and leave my room. im met with my roommate standing in the hall plugging his ears. the moment we saw each other the siren stopped. we both looked outside, no ambulance. never consulted with neighbors, but when i went to work at my 911 job and asked night shift if they sent anybody to my apartment complex or if a fire alarm went off that night, they said absolutely not. that nights call logs proved them correct. none of my friends believed us but we knew what we heard. it was nuts.

[CLS]	[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	[SEP]	when i was around 12 years old i woke in the middle of the night needing to use the toilet. my room was unusually dark so i quickly got up and walked over to my bedroom door only when i reached for the light switch my hand touched the window which was on the other side of the room. i began to feel incredibly disoriented so i stood still for a minute to let my eyes adjust to the darkness. for some reason the room became darker, i'm talking absolute blackness. i thought that maybe i'd somehow turned around in my sleep and woken up with my head at the bottom of the bed which is why i'd walked to the wrong side of the room. i took a breath and walked to where the door should've been. i reached for the door but could only feel wallpaper. this went on for what felt like half an hour, no matter which direction i went in, i kept ending up on the opposite side of the room to where i should have been. so there i was, sliding my hands around the walls, frantically trying to find my bedroom door. at this point i'm terrified and crying. i stumbled back in to the middle of the room and got back in to bed. after my heart stopped racing i decided to try again. this time, my bedroom door was right where it had always been. i turned on the light, my pillows were were at the correct end of the bed, everything was in it's place. it was the freakiest experience and i slept with my door open for years after.

[SEP]	when i was about 4 or 5, this guy used to come to my window every night. the first time, my curtains were closed, and i heard a little tapping sound. my bed was right against the window, so i rolled over and opened the curtains, thinking it was one of my brothers being stupid. it was some dude i didn't know, at eye level with me. then, while holding eye contact with me, he started doing what looked like sign language. it went on for a few minutes, then he nodded at me and walked off. happened the next night, and the night after that, and for the next three months until we moved away. the window was open; if he'd wanted to abduct me, he could have at any time. every damn day i told my family, and they never once believed me about the sign language guy. they used to call him my imaginary friend, and to this day, they tell me i made it all up. i was wide awake, and i know what the hell i saw, though.

(total bs. i liked the dentist, and i was a people pleaser. also, laughing gas). my moms lawyer was super pessimistic and told her just to settle and sign an nda because she had a small chance of winning. so my mom settled, being naive and scared to take on an office full of liars. she could never disclose who the dentist was, and weve heard other horror stories throughout the years about this dentist effing up other peoples mouths. it sucks because every lawyer weve talked to after-the-fact says we had a very strong case and its likely we would have won. like really won.

[SEP]	i used to work for a company in the middle east that provided relocation services to people in america. we represented 3 main companies under 9 different names which changed every so often when the reviews got really bad. we had receptionists whose main task, aside from damage control, was to write a few extremely positive reviews for each company every single day in order to counter all the negative ones. i worked in sales. our job was to catalog everything our clients wanted to move and then provide the best possible price while lying through our teeth about the service itself. we promised professional movers who had all the necessary training and tools for the job, great prices, quick deliveries, you name it. on moving day, the movers who showed up were often in unmarked trucks or ones with completely different names and branding on them. the workers were often immigrants who were paid under-the-table and had no experience whatsoever. the deliveries themselves often took a long time and items were often lost as multiple moves would be stacked into one truck without much labeling of items or categorizing in general. as mentioned earlier, we changed company names fairly often as the negative reviews and bad press stacked up. moving is a toxic business, and people will always try to undermine and cheat. this is something you should never cheap out on as the money is well worth the comfort of knowing your move is in good hands. if you are moving, i recommend finding a company that is local if possible, so that you can meet the people who represent it and see that their business is legitimate. more importantly, they will be able to send someone to survey your belongings and give a more realistic quote and time estimate. even if it costs much more than the quotes you receive online or from salesmen, it is well worth the peace of mind on an already stressful venture. edit: spelling and grammar	[SEP]	110

[SEP]	&#x200b; when i was in high school this kid kept bragging about joining the russian mob. he was kind of a shit head. sold drugs. and way more than just pot. no one really believed him. and then one day he disappeared off the face of the earth. this was a while ago. i'm in my 30s now. so no facebook, no proliferation of cell phones. one day he was just gone from our lives. well, turned out somewhere up the chain of drug dealer scum this kid really did have connections to the russian mob. they offered to let him in. told him he'd make tons of money. people would respect and fear him. girls would suck his dick 24/7. whatever he wanted. all they wanted from him was to show his loyalty by doing a hit. mother fucker was 17. he killed some rival drug dealer or something stupid like that. the russians set him up and let him take the fall. this was over 20 years ago. he's still in prison. he will never leave. and that was just one fucking day in the lives of the people that dumbass looked up to. i didn't breach an nda but i think 20 years later the russian mob probably isn't going to kill me for talking on reddit. so it kinda fits.

[CLS]	bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	[SEP]	its been said already, but to reiterate: 1. ring the bell, pull the cord, push the button (however it works on your bus) for your stop at least a block or two before we actually get to the stop . and even if its a stop we will make anyway. drivers cant read your minds, so signaling will let us know you want to get off the bus. signaling as we pass your stop is pointless, because. 2. buses cant stop on a dime! dont step out in front of a bus and expect us to stop safely for you. also, after getting off the bus, dont cross in front of us! either cross behind us or wait for us to pass. its too easy for us to run you over. 3. if you see your bus at your stop, board quickly. we are on a schedule and cannot wait around for everyone to lollygag their way to the stop. hurry up and get to the bus. youre holding up the bus and everyone on it. 4. if youre the only one standing at a stop served by multiple routes and im a bus that you *dont* want, signal to me that you dont want my bus so i dont have to waste my time stopping for you. shake your head, turn away from us, step away from the stop, or something. 5. buses are not taxis. we have routes, schedules, and designated stops. if you are on the street in between stops and see a bus you need or want, dont flag them down and expect them to stop for you. many times our policies dont permit us to stop anywhere except a designated bus stop. 6. we are most likely not the last bus that will ever service your stop. so if you miss your bus, or if we leave before you make it to the stop, dont try to sprint to catch up with us. wait for the next one! and if you really need to catch my bus at that very moment, be on time to the stop! 7. when the bus is crowded, please move as far back as you can to allow people to get on the bus. there is no stigma to sitting in the back of the bus. 8. when exiting the bus, use the back doors unless you need special attention offboarding, e.g., if youre in a wheelchair, use a walker, or otherwise require us to kneel the bus (which can only be done at the front). 9. when boarding a bus with a special needs passenger who is offboarding, wait for them to get off and clear the bus before you push your way on. 10. be considerate of other people! this is not your personal limousine. this is public space. not everyone wants to watch you eat or hear your music or watch your videos. 11. if you clip your nails on my bus, i will kick you the fuck off it. that is just plain disgusting. take care of your personal hygiene in a proper bathroom somewhere else! 12. if you need help with anything, especially route information, never hesitate to ask the driver. nine times out of ten, they will be happy to help. 13. but please dont distract us for too long. we cant be your therapist and safely operate the bus at the same time. (nor would many of us want to.) 14. we are people too, not your servants, so please be kind and courteous to us. we may be in a service position, but that doesnt mean we have to take your shit. 15. this is a large vehicle, not a jungle gym. find a seat and sit in it. do not swing yourself from the bars. if you cannot sit down, hold on to something! this list is way longer than i thought it would be!

[SEP]	"i drove for my college's transportation system, so there were no fares to ride. one thing that's a given on most public transportation systems is the courtesy of letting the people currently on the bus get off before you try to get on; this was very difficult for college kids for some reason, and it was compounded by the fact that you can board through both the front and the back door, so we'd have people trying to squeeze their way on (at both doors) while there were still people getting off. it's a pipe dream, but that problem would go away completely if everyone would just board in the front and exit in the back. such a simple solution that sadly will never, ever happen because people are too {insert adjective}. also, when you get on the bus (or are already on it), and the bus is getting full so you're standing, and there are more people coming on, **move toward the back**. i had to sit there and talk to these people (of all ages) like children, ""please move back and make room,"" because they simply were unaware that they were standing directly in the way of like 20 people trying to board when there's still plenty of room on the bus. i guess, if i can sum it all up, just pay attention, and realize that you're not the only person on the bus."

[SEP]	i used to be a bus driver and now work in management for a public transit agency. i always feel the worst for drivers when they get chewed out for things they cannot control, like running late. there are times where theres a big event in town and traffic is at a complete standstill and people get mad at the driver because the bus is late. like, what.? also, most bus drivers are some of the nicest, hardest working people ive ever met. its not easy to drive a bus and have the safety of so many people in your hands (not just on the bus, but anyone around the bus). give them the benefit of the doubt as much as possible. also, public transit is extremely underfunded. buses are built to last 12 years but many (pretty much all) agencies have to run buses much longer because of lack of funding. this means buses break down more and end up costing more in the long run due to maintenance. i just had a call the other day where someone complained the bus they rode on was old and dirty and just trash. that bus is almost 20 years old; we dont choose to keep it around because we want to, but because we have to. so many people in the community really rely on public transit but there are political groups actively trying to reduce funding to make public transit worse. i feel bad for the people who really need it. public transit constantly gets requests for more service, or to expand it to areas where it isnt, but they cant because theres not enough funding. theres plenty of money in the economy, but politicians prioritize other things. please speak up to your representatives to provide more funding for public transit. ppublix transit is full of hard working people trying to do the right thing to improve lives in the community and provide opportunity.

[SEP]	im a bus driver from a city of ~90k. for the most part, people say hello, goodbye, and thank you, and as a driver it is appreciated. one thing i wish customers knew is that sometimes youll see a bus driver stop at a coffee shop and come out with a coffee. 99% of the time, the stop wasnt to get a coffee. during my shift, (540a-240p) i get off my bus for one 35-40 minute break. if i have to use a restroom outside of that break, i may have to use a coffee shop for that purpose. these coffee shops usually know whats up, and drivers tend to know the ones that have good, clean washrooms. they dont get paid by my employer for allowing us to use their facilities, and to keep them clean, so we feel kinda of obligated to purchase something when we use their establishment. even in a city of my size, we still get people taking photos of our drivers walking to or from a shop with a coffee or something. it sucks to get hammered in the press because you had to take a leak and couldnt hold it.

[SEP]	"i've been working on public transit for about six years now. i operated streetcars that functioned like buses (a stop at every block, but they don't stop unless there's demand for it), buses, and light rail trains now. operators can be kind of petty because we work a somewhat thankless job. 1) if you want terrible service, be sure to remind the operator that he's late. i've gotten stuck in traffic, or stuck behind another train that broke down, or any number of things that i couldn't do a damn thing about. once i'm on the move again, there's always at least one person who looks at me sternly and taps their watch. i get it, i'm late. the little trip computer has been showing negative numbers for the last fifteen minutes; it's hard to miss. by doing this, i specifically remember you. if there's a point in the future where i'm on time and you're not, i won't wait for you now because you annoyed the hell out of me. 2) if you want great service, bring food. sealed food is the best. a bottle of soda where the seal hasn't been popped, an unopened bag of chips or whatnot can help a lot. i'll not even joking when i said i had a regular that brought me a big cookie once, and two weeks later i didn't see him at his usual station. i did, however, see him running up from about a block away. since he was actually running and had brought me good food, we all waited for him even though it made me a little late. i made up the time quickly enough though. 3) stop requests are important. if you're on a route that has stops in every block, we're not stopping at each one every time. pull the cord, push the button, even saying ""next stop, please!"" is enough communication. standing behind me is not. do you want a better view of where you're going because you're lost? do you want the next stop? or what about the stop after that? if you stand there silently, i know nothing. 4) hearing music on the bus and train sucks because 99% of time it's not music you like. shut that shit off, an don't you dare get upset when the operator or another passenger asks you to be a decent human being and turn it off. 5) the trains i run now have very limited rearward visibility from the cab. a lot of stuff happens behind me that i miss. if you see someone unload bodily fluids onto the train, let the operator know. i wouldn't want to ride a train with vomit all over the floor, and i don't expect you all to either. 6) holding the door for your buddy who is late or was hanging out on the wrong side of the platform is a dick move and i don't know if any train operator who doesn't wish misfortune upon those who do it. i personally try to limit the amount of misfortune i wish upon these people to ""i hope a bird shits on your head"" but man, if you do this at the wrong time, you could probably bottle my rage and sell it as a renewable energy source."

[CLS]	what's the dumbest thing you've ever done because your brain was on autopilot?	[SEP]	i am a creature of habit. i go to bed at the same time every night, i wake up the same time every morning, i eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every week because i meal prep, i get off of work at the same time everyday and get home at the same time every day, first thing i do when i get home is get in the shower. well this one particular day i got zero sleep i had a lady friend spend the night and so my brain was on auto pilot all day. i made 2 cups of coffee the problem is i didnt drink the first cup before i decided to make the second cup and 2 cups of coffee can not occupy 1 mug. i didnt realize it until i started to make a 3rd cup and i looked over to see if the mug was under the machine to find coffee all over my desk. later that day i got home and hopped into the shower and opened my eyes and tried to figure out how water drops got on my closed eyeballs before i realized i left my glasses on.

[CLS]	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	[SEP]	don't know how major or interesting this is but in athens in the area of faliro () (which used to be the port of ancient athens before it was moved to piraeus) during some excavations for the construction of a cultural center, a huge cemetery was discovered. an entire year of construction was put on hold (and this is a frequent problem in athens, major construction work running into ancient buried buildings which now have to be preserved). apparently the cemetery is interesting not only because it hosts many dead babies and children, which were buried inside vessels, (infant mortality rate was very high) but also many prisoners and criminals who were executed. there's also a mass grave of about 80 shackled men. it has been speculated the mass grave may be related to cylon of athens, a winner in the olympics and wannabe tyrant, who tried to stage a coup by taking over the acropolis but was promptly chased out of there by megacles (of a powerful athenian clan) and escaped to megara. his followers sought refuge in the altar of athena polias. anyone present at an altar was considered to be under the protection of the gods, and was not allowed to be harmed. they agreed to descend the acropolis afted being promised they would be left unharmed but were slaughtered nonetheless by the followers of megacles, as they considered the men unworthy of the gods' protection.

[CLS]	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	[SEP]	i'm primarily an egyptologist but i work for a uk regional archaeology crew, and recently they found a specific vessel which was very unusual. its hard to describe but i couldn't find a picture, but it was a smallish clay pot, which had been made on a wheel and was incredibly well-made, but the neck of it was tiny, and it pinched in and out at points. bad description i know. anyway, we got it dated to around the stuart era, and gave it over to a potter who we sometimes worked with, so he could attempt to make a copy. he couldn't do it. he made a lovely pot, but it was nothing like the original. he explained that he couldn't get the clay thin enough to pinch like the original, because his hands were simply too big to make a pot with a neck of that size. so after a lot of thought they came to a conclusion that it must have been children making these pots (i suggested women but it turned out even womens hands were too big). based on other circumstantial evidence from the same context, this was from a relatively poor family, who trained their children in the same trade as them to create beautiful pottery to sell to the elites. in the stuart era, that style of pottery was around a lot, but it had started not too far from the city we found it in, so we figured they must have been copying the popular style. it's so interesting to think that a child, probably no more than 8, made such a beautiful piece of work. edit - just adding for clarification as it seems to have confused some people - when i said i'm an egyptologist, i mean that's my main link to archaeology. the pot i'm talking about here is from a regional archaeology find - it's stuart, as in its english and dates from the 15th/16th centuries. its not egyptian, just to clear up any confusion!

( so far the other remains have been found in siberia ) denisovans have only come up in conversation and discovery quite recently so its always crazy to find any sort of remains. really gives an idea to our development and what we might have evolved from ! edit ; sleepiness and just general dumb-ness led me to adding that denisovans and neanderthals lived in the same area. i included this since the original cave in siberia where the denisovan remains were found, neanderthal remains were also found. this led my little brain to come to this big conclusion which is obviously false so thankyou to everyone who corrected me !

[SEP]	okay i've got another one related to my actual degree (egyptology). the tomb of neithhotep was discovered in the early 1900's, but it was badly damaged and therefore we're still investigating all the material we have. a lot of it was burnt by tomb robbers but there is still some epigraphic evidence. one of the most interesting pieces is a tiny piece of pottery with a serekh on it, the symbol of the name of the king. for context, neithhotep was from predynastic egypt, just before the first dynasty. and this is where it gets exciting - neithhotep is believed to be the mother of the first pharaoh of egypt. however, on this piece of pottery, her name is written in a serekh. indicating she was a pharaoh. of course its possible that it was just indicating her as queen, but it's quite fun to think that there's a very good chance the first pharaoh of egypt was a woman. furthermore, as far as we can tell, this is the earliest ever surviving evidence of a woman's name written down. we all thought that was pretty cool.

[CLS]	archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	[SEP]	it's difficult to talk about things that have been found in the field, but not formally published. the act of publishing is where all the background information, theoretical models, data collection, and analysis go to offer interpretations of finds found in the field. like, you may have found a tomb, but you can't say much more than it is a tomb, the location, and a general overview of the contents without sitting down and doing the analysis of the mortuary goods, the skeletal remains, and the soils and then comparing all of that to other known excavated tombs to find similarities and differences on a regional, temporal, and/or cultural scale. so as a rule, archaeologists tend not to talk about things they found in the field until they've had a chance to do all that work and get a publication either in the process of being published (review and edit stage) or the publication is scheduled to come out soon in the next issue of a journal. there's a lot more work that goes into archaeology than many people realize. it's not just digging in the dirt, giving what you find a cursory glance, and making broad sweeping proclamations about the past. there's radiocarbon samples, ceramic sherds, chert/obsidian, bones, metal, fibers, soil, pollen, faunal remains, floral remains, etc. that can and is tested to inform us about the dates of occupation, where clay or chert/obsidian sources are located, the dna of a person or the stable isotope value that indicates where they grew up, the sources of metals, what plants or animals make up the preserved fibers, chemical signatures in the soil that may indicate certain kinds of activity, the types of plants being grown nearby, and the animals and plants people consumed. it's a monumental undertaking to do archaeology. that being said, i could talk about some recent work that i've done and presented on at a conference if anyone is still interested.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"back during wow's second expansion there was this guy in my guild i'd become friends with mostly through other friends. we talked more and more over time and became fairly close. he had this asshole roommate, and i could hear the guy sometimes, especially when something went wrong during a raid. he'd scream and throw fits, he was pretty awful sounding. my friend told me he wasn't just loud and obnoxious, but verbally and sometimes physically abusive, too. i had my own apartment, so i said you know what, come stay with me. just long enough to get you on your feet and into a place that's safe. he showed up at my place with a trash bag full of his stuff and a laptop. i set him up in the apartment and started trying to help him find a job. well, he did not want a job. he did not get a job, either. he sat in my apartment, day after day, eating my food and slowly draining my savings. no matter how hard i tried to get him motivated, he would just dig in his heels and somehow become more sedentary. eventually i told him he had to go. i couldn't afford to keep him there. he was just couch surfing. i spoke to some people and eventually pieced together that his method of securing a new ""temporary"" place was playing on the sympathies of his friends to convince them he was in a terrible living situation. it just worked really well on me because he had that loud, obnoxious roommate to play off of. he wound up calling a nearby relative to come and get him, i think his aunt. i don't know what he told her i supposedly did, but i have never seen a more venomous look from someone in my life. as far as i know he moved in with his sister and brother in law after that, but frankly i don't care where he ended up. he also stole a bunch of my stuff. first and last time i do anything like that."

[SEP]	this is more of an embarrassment story. when i was in high school in the 90s i was active on the local dial up bbs scene. i was friends with someone who went by the handle venus. i knew she was a woman but had no idea what she looked like. i also knew she was dating a guy in real life with the handle lord gumby who was also a friend online. being a socially misadjusted 15 year old i had a crush on her anyway even though i knew they were both like 18. this was like 1992 so privacy wasnt as big a concern and they knew my address. this was also when people would randomly come by your house to see if you were home. thats unfathomable today. so one saturday morning im at home on my computer totally disheveled, unshowered, and just gross in ratty sweatpants and no shirt. i hear a knock on the front door and go open it. theres a woman who was incredibly beautiful standing there and she just goes hi! im venus! i stood there for a minute it seemed like jaw dropped trying to say something when lord gumby walked up and was like hey doofus, ever met a woman before? needless to say i wanted to sink into a hole in the ground and die. but i hung out with them and i guess i wasnt too horrible because we hung out a lot after that. but that whole time i was like fuck my life choices! havent talked to them in decades. i wonder how theyre doing.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	this is way back in the mid 90s. bulletin board systems were all the rage. i made friends with this guy from nc - he was friends with a bunch of us from my dorm, mostly females, which should probably have been a red flag but i was extremely naive at the time. a couple months in, he mentioned he was coming to our state for a wedding and asked if he could come by our college to meet everyone. it was agreed hed sleep in my dorm room since my roommate was almost never around. now, there was no discussion or thought of sex, but i was pretty excited to meet this guy and see if he was as funny and charming as he was online. well. day arrives, dude shows up. i should mention that i and all my college friends were 18 or 19, this guy was 24. or so he said. guy looked like, and im not exaggerating, a cancer patient. pale, gaunt features, long greasy pale blond hair except where he was bald on top, and just generally looked like he was about to die or he was dressed as a ghoul for halloween. he insisted on hugging all of us. i was trying to remind myself that looks dont matter and that he was a cool guy despite his very unsettling appearance. but then, when we all started hanging out, things just got worse. he was asking really invasive questions of all of us, making weird comments to whatever was said, just all around creepy and distressing. i was sitting on the floor with another friend and actively rocking back and forth from discomfort. i lied and said i had hurt my back and that sleeping on the floor helped, because that night he kept insisting we could share my tiny twin college bed. nope nope nope nope nope. last time i ever met anyone from that site.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	he and i were part of the same forum many, many years ago. he was dealing with his issues and i was dealing with mine. i think we both went there to escape, where people wouldnt judge. also, because we were bored. im not quite sure when we got properly talking, i think its when he told a terrible joke about kipper ties. we used to share everything with each other, over msn. id give him advice about his love life and hed listen to all my fuck ups. it took quite a few fuck ups before we eventually met up. i think i already knew we were in love but seeing him in person really cemented it. we decided to give it a go, even though we lived 300 miles away from each other. we had a lot of ups and downs. i was distant, he lived with his ex girlfriend for a bit even though she didnt have a job and couldnt afford her half of the rent. the same ex gf who id given him advice on, who he had nicknamed trouble and liked to claim she was pregnant every so often. we got over that, along with many other things, and finally moved in with each other. i thought our issues were gonna be solved when there was no distance between us. ends up, we were just very different people who wanted very different things and the distance wasn't gonna change that. we broke up after three and a half years together. none of thats the horror story. not the way he treated me, not the fact he probably cheated on me, not that i wasnt a priority and used to cry myself to sleep. about a year and a half after breaking up, he gets back in touch and we talk like it was in the beginning, when we were friends. after a few weeks, he asked if i want to get back together. i said no. i told him that hed broken my heart again. the next day, i got a phone call from his work because i was still his emergency contact asking me if i knew where he was because he hasnt turned up. the police got in touch too. the last phone call that day was from his mum, to let me know that hed killed himself.

[SEP]	ive been active in numerous online communities over the years, and have been fortunate enough to hang out with many of the friends ive made there in person. theres only been one incident i couldnt cope with. he picked me up at the airport, which was very nice of him, and as soon as we got into the car, he started picking his nose. theres a lot that goes through your mind when you hop into a vehicle with someone youve never been alone with and you immediately catch them two knuckles deep in their rostrum. i looked quickly away so that he wouldnt know i caught him and be embarrassed, if he was just trying to sneak one out before i noticed. if he did notice, he didnt seem embarrassed, so i relaxed a little. i guessed maybe he was just so confident about himself and our friendship that hed ascended past caring if i saw him take care of a quick boog. fine, sure. when i finally looked back at him, he was wiping his fingers across his dashboard. to this day im not really sure what to think, but this guy spent the entirety of the few hours we were together scooping out boogers and wiping them off on parts of his car or the table or wherever it was that wed stopped at. i realized i was being transported in a rolling booger shrine and that there was nothing i could touch without needing to wash my hands. i was sitting on a crust of fossilized booger stuff. i had to be. i didnt want to hurt his feelings, he was a nice dude, but i wound up ollying out of our visit early because i couldnt handle it. i dont consider myself a clean freak, but as wiping started to stack it was all i could do not to throw open the passenger door and roll myself out into traffic to escape. i still wonder if i should have done or said anything to save him some grief in the future but it didnt feel like it was my place, you know? what do you even say?

""figured out where you live. i'm outside of the dorms at the cafe across the street. meet me."" this guy lived on the west coast, and after finding out where i lived, he makes an unannounced trip across the country, tracked down the building where i lived in, and was camped out at the cafe across the street. asking him to meet him. all of this *without any head's up.* i immediately felt uncomfortable, and didn't really know what to do. it's one thing to meet up, another thing entirely to make a trip cross country and camp out in front of a person's residence. i didn't answer the aim message right away and needed some time to calm down and think, get more rational. more messages started coming through, each reading slightly more hostile than the last. okay, this guy traveled all this way. it'd be a dick move to ignore him, but at the same time, i felt like i was seeing red flags everywhere. i was legitimately creeped out. more messages came, and each time, they started to get more agitated, more impatient. he started asking for my class schedule so he could meet me outside class, asking where i'd be going, where i usually ate, what time my dinner schedule was. he started getting weirdly specific about wanting to know about every facet of my life. i was getting full-on stalker vibes. so i lied, and told him that i was visiting my sister and that i'd be back over the weekend, and *i'd just miss him.* that's when he said ""that's fine. i can wait."" and he did. three days later, he's still there, still messaging me that he's ""still at the cafe. waiting."" *what the fuck are you waiting for? why are you here? why didn't you tell me you were coming?* my privacy was having huge issues with all of this, and it got to the point i started feeling legitimately scared. i made a decision. rather than meet him, i'd log out out aim, create a new handle, pretend i never existed at that point. i completely abandoned my livejournal and started posting under a new name, and went so far as to change my entire online persona. i never heard from him again."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	sorry in advance, this is a long one. i was talking to this girl i met on quizilla back in 2008/9. we met because she made one of thosewhich twilight characters are you? quizzes, and i was asking for help on making mine. we got to talking and realized that we were roughly the same age, lived in the same state only a couple hours apart, and had quite a few things in common. fast forward a few months, i start thinking of her as one of my genuine best friends, and we start to broach the subject of meeting irl. my parents- understandably- have their doubts, and only agree to let me meet her if i agree to bring my older brother along. (i was 13, he was 18). i agree, and the girl and i arrange to meet at a museum that is equidistant from both of us. so the day comes, and its time for me to finally meet this girl ive been talking to for a solid 6-7 months. my brother agrees that hes not going to breathe down my neck, but that ill always be within eyeshot. i see her at the entrance when i walk up, and everything seems to be going well! after all, shes not an 80 year old man, and she looks exactly like her pictures, which is really all that i could possibly expect from the situation. later on in the day, my brother meets up with us so that he could drive us somewhere to get lunch, and everything immediately went downhill from there. this was the first time my brother had really seen her up close, and not from a few meters away, and he gets a really confused look on his face. he doesnt react further, but stays pretty much quiet the rest of the drive. i think nothing of it, and just assume that hes letting us talk and doesnt want to interrupt. when we get to the restaurant, she doesnt want to sit on my side of the booth with me, instead choosing to sit next to my brother. she claims that this is because she wants to be able to look at me while shes talking, but my brother is looking more and more uncomfortable with the situation. i decide to sit next to him instead, and dont really give her an option. suddenly, the conversation starts to drift from me and her, to just about my brother. what he does for school, where he works, his friends, etc. i start getting really jealous, and eventually blow up saying are you here to talk to me, or to just my brother??? she starts backpedaling, and apologizes for ignoring me. at that moment, my brother finally realizes that he recognizes her as a girl that had been stalking him on myspace for the past few months, but without all of the terrible filters/makeup/angles that he was use to seeing her with. he immediately gets super freaked out, and starts saying that we need to leave, and that she needs to find her own way home. we end up leaving as soon as her parents come to pick her up, and i never hear from her again. and thats the story of how my junior high online best friend was also my brothers weird myspace stalker. needless to say, he still brings it up to this day, and uses it against me at every opportunity.

[SEP]	i (25) was best friends with a woman (46) for nearly six years. we would talk for hours and send each other gifts constantly. we shared everything from art to personal trauma. we were very close. when i fell in hard times, she was very kind and offered to take me in. i was so grateful that she would do this for me. after a few months, things started to change. i started to see why she was such a lonely person. she was mean, if not cruel, to anyone who ever disagreed with her or even had a different opinion. she was so mentally unstable that she couldn't even buy something without having to call her elderly mother and ask for permission. i found out that she was scamming the disability services to get money from the government because she didn't want her mother tracking her spending. she was so horrible to her caregiver. i'll admit that the guy was a complete moron, but he was still a sweet guy that was just trying to help. she was so abusive towards him that i had to step in on multiple occasions, which she fucking hated because it meant i wasn't on her side. that's when she turned on me. she began to freak out over small stuff. screaming and crying because i missed a spot while mopping or because i spilled a little bit if water in the kitchen or ate my food too fast. she was fucking insane! as soon as i realized how messed up and unstable she was (after being screamed at and chased back to my room) i told her that i was going to be moving out as soon as possible. so, for the next week, she decided to make my life a living hell. she would scream about me to other people on the phone, telling lies about me, saying i did things i never did. and because she was a youtuber with a big following, she doxed me on social media, telling people i punched holes in her walls and keyed her car. she even called the cops and tried to get me arrested for things i didn't do. her followers began to harass me, sending me rape/death threats. then she started posting and sharing all of my personal secrets that i had shared with her in confidence. i ended up having to call my family to come get me because she was wanting to keep my dog so that i would have to keep in contact with her and i was no longer feeling save. so, after six months of living in hell and three years of internet harassment and stalking that followed, i'll never meet someone i met online ever again. i have no interest in online friends. it's not safe because you never know how absolutely fucked up someone is until it's too late	[SEP]	796

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	back in about 1998, i met someone playing an online word game. we were both 16 year old girls and we just hit it off and became very close. finally in 2004 she was passing though where i lived so i invited her to stay for a few days. she shows up totally coked up. then she invites some guy over and they were snorting cocaine off her car key in my living room. i didn't know she used coke and i was so uncomfortable the entire time. it was like having a stranger there, yet we knew everything about each other. we remained in touch and i still really like her but it was just such an awkward visit. we haven't seen each other since, though. edit: fixed a typo	[SEP]	538

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"oh finally i have somewhere to tell this story, but it's probably too late to get any real traction. long story short, when i was doing a lot of online dating i had multiple accounts across multiple platforms. one happened to be fetlife. i used pictures there that i hadn't put online before, with my face cropped out. it didnt pan out however, i didn't really like any of the guys that messaged me, i was polite to them all but ultimately kind of abandoned my profile. cue tinder, i match with a guy that looks white collar, tailored, professional. just my type. we match, talk for a week or so until we decide to get drinks. i get to the bar (took an uber there) and look around. dont see him. until this scraggly looking guy comes up to me and says ""oh hey grenadinegarden! i thought youd never make it!"" now, i'm not unusually one to judge by appearances, we all have rough days and lord knows i dont wear makeup or do my hair on the busiest of them, but his hair was significantly longer (think short, well manicured hair versus mid back length uncombed waves), he was covered in a patchy beard, and dressed really badly. i honestly didnt recognize him, and he waved it off with ""sorry. those pictures are kind of old"". red flag stupidly ignored, we grab a small table with huge chair and start drinking and talking. one drink, just to be polite, but i'm turned off at this point wholly. then, the kicker. he leans in toward me, puts his hand on my thigh, and says, ""you know, after you didnt message me back on fetlife, i'm surprised we matched on tinder. you really are quite beautiful."" at this point i'm like ""?!?!?!?! i'm sorry????"" he chuckles, literally chuckles like a villain in a movie, pats my thigh, and says ""i'm going to the bathroom. you should look at your profile and figure it out. i found you because your body is quite distinct."" it's worth noting we live in a major international tourist city. there are thousands upon thousands of new people here every day. especially on tinder. this is not a small town. i used to match with people that would swipe between connecting flights! so i'm beyond nervous, watch him get up and go, and i quickly check my fetlife inbox and lo and behold, he had messaged me months ago. his profile picture looked like an absolute serial killer. i remember why i rejected him. incompatible on all fronts. and i was polite. so anyways, i got to use the whole ""angel shot"" protocol. in which i basically ran to the bartender, explained the situation, and left through the back door. i was beyond uncomfortable. and deleted all of my social media for a few months. and i consider myself lucky that he only sent a few ""you're a whore etcetc"" messages for the rest of the evening but gave up after that. and i paid for my own drink, too. i'm not a monster."

[SEP]	"it's not a horror story, it's a story about how i was put off meeting people from the internet i was friends with a bunch of people i met through an online game. after about 2 years, i decided to meet 2 of them. the 2 i was meeting were a long distance couple, one from one country and the other from mine. they had met many times and had spent 2 weeks together prior to meeting with me. we met in the city, said hi and hugged and did some touristy stuff, took their pictures etc etc. but throughout the whole time, they weren't really talking to me. at first, i put it down to anxiety as i was nervous too. but even after lunch, they were only talking to each other and i felt left out. i even took a sneaky video of them talking to each other and sent it a friend, who agreed it was odd. when it was time for me to leave, i told them i had to go but i had a nice time, and they continued to chat to each other. i said it again but no response, so i started to walk away, until one of them said ""oh byeee"" i was really hurt. it was like they didn't want me to be with them. i had spent a lot of money getting down, especially since at the time i didn't have a job. when i got back, i stopped talking to them. the friend who i sent the video to sent a message to them asking why they were ignoring me, and they tried to turn it on me saying that i was the quiet one and that i was being rude to them, especially ""leaving without saying goodbye"". i blocked them all on the game. a few months go bye and one of them finds my social media and tries to reconnect. starts off well, and then goes back to blaming me. haven't met anyone from the internet since"	[SEP]	2230

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i'd been chatting to a girl for quite some time and finally ended up visiting her house about 50 miles away for an evening of enjoying each others company. we wake up the next morning to loud noises, which turned out to be her fiance i knew nothing about, ripping a window off it's hinges and climbing in as she'd locked him out (locked the door and left the key in the lock) and there was a strange car on the driveway, so he thought she might be in trouble. alas, it was me in trouble as this guy was huge, and a bit upset by this point. i managed to talk him down and explained the situation, to then find she had called the police and accused him of breaking and entering. during the time the police were questioning him, i made my escape and high-tailed it out of there.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i never actually met him but i used to play runescape when i was younger (around 11ish). i didnt pay for the member account so there were a bunch of items and things i couldnt get. some member started gifting me things and i was super grateful. every time i went on he would help me with my quests and whatever. but over time he started asking more personal questions like what i looked like, what i liked to do etc. etc. in return he told me his first name, that he was 14 and that he was in the army as some cadet programme or something but back visiting family blah blah. i knew nothing about the army, a cadet programme at that age didnt sound that far fetched to little ol me. he started to escalate how he was talking to me and started sending me messages like hi sexy, miss you come back and talk to me babe. etc. i stopped replying because i was creeped out and was 11. i still thought boys were gross. anyway in school the next day i was making small talk with a girl i sat next to and she mentioned how her brother was home and how much shed missed him while hed been away in the army. i got a sinking feeling then which continued when she told me his name (a match). in desperation i asked her if he ever played runescape in which she said he did and his username was friendsusername she showed me a picture and told me about how she was really excited about how hed finally found his calling in the army. dude was 26. yikes	[SEP]	449
[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i have two. one was this guy from an mmo i played. he was older than me, married, had a kid, stuck up for me a lot. everyone said not to trust him, but i thought i knew him better than that. he told me he thought i was really smart, and he wanted to make a journal with me. because a journal needs a lot of content, though, he asked me to write extra stuff to save for future publications. i had nothing going on so i said i'd do it, even though his prompts were super specific and kind of boring. one day, though, he called me and asked me to go into his email because he didn't get online and he needed something. i saw a folder with my name on it, so i clicked it. it was filled with emails to other people, with my writing attached, and negotiations for payment. he was selling my writing to college kids for $500 - $1000 each. the second guy, i met from the same game. he was in a bad place and i felt sorry for him. i offered to let him join me and my new roommate in our apartment search. the rent was going to be super cheap. he was really messy, though (filthy, even) and i told him that since the landlord was really strict, he'd have to make sure to keep things somewhat clean. he went to my roommate behind my back, said i was too controlling, and offered to replace me with his way cooler friend (who would pay more, of course). i just considered this a bullet dodged and moved on. i got an even better, somehow cheaper apartment. when he saw the photos online, he freaked out, started stalking my mom (sending me notes on where she was throughout the day), and when i called the cops on him, he called in a bomb threat to my work. i lost my job and my apartment. don't worry, i'm not dumb anymore.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	this is /u/kikistiel 's story, but it popped into my head because she wins all horror stories imo with this. [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/sadcringe/comments/9b9pk6/the_dirtiest_job/e51q307/?context=3) copy/paste text: this almost was me. almost. long story time: i am an artist, and my main job before the one i have now was selling my work at comic, anime, and video game cons across the us and canada, and sometimes in more countries. it was surprisingly a lucrative job if you did it right and i enjoyed it, and required a lot more work than people realized. but i digress, the point is i was familiar with the convention scene and this leads me to my next point: i used to take commissions at conventions but i stopped doing them years ago because i got too busy and my art had improved enough that $100 felt too low for my skill level, and im all about artists pricing their work fairly and not working for pennies. a couple of years ago, just as i had started phasing out commission work, a man had approached me at a con. you get a lot of socially awkward people at cons, to be expected, but 99.5% of them are really sweet and just like to talk about stuff the dig. if you have a good amount of patience, its enjoyable. but this guy. he immediately asked me if i did commissions. i said no, unfortunately not anymore.he asked me how much my prices were, and usually when people ask i just. quote some arbitrary high number just to get them to throw out the idea without outright telling them no. and if they want to pay it, well. then we can talk. i said $350. he said, cool, done. in cash? i was stammering at him, not expecting him to go for it. eventually i just asked him what he wanted. to make a long story shorter, he wanted furry art. soft core porn to be exact. i had never in my life done furry art, but i knew how lucrative it seemed to be. i said oh, each character would be extra. nsfw would be extra too. this would be a big commission. hes like oh no worries. how much extra? this went back and forth for a while and to save time, he paid me $700, in cash, on the spot, for some furry porn. i wasnt even mad, $700 is nice, so i said sure ill draw the furry porn. what do i care? ill fake sign it, its one and done. after i did it in one night in my hotel room, i found he had taken my business card and had given my email to his friends who may be interested in commissioning art. the requests for weirder and weirder, but the pay stayed surprisingly good. eventually, i ended up making a furaffinity account under a fake name and tweaked my style and techniques enough that no one could ever trace the art back to me. i decided to just fully embrace the furry art bank life. it was open season  i guarantee you i was a no-name in that community and still made good money, so im horrified to think what the really popular artists get. i didnt feel ashamed for drawing weird furry fetish porn, nor did i feel bad for kinda being a fraud. i provided a service, and that was it. things went downhill when i mistakenly befriended someone in the community. she was another furry artist, and we just sort of hit it off in the online community. she seemed like an edgy self-hating furry so our jabbing humor at the expense of furries made us bond. she was cool, all was well. eventually i admitted to her that i didnt actually give a shit about furries, and she took it in stride. said she understood why i used the community to make money because she wished she wasnt a fucking furry either, but you cant help what you like. she told me that if i really wanted to make bank, i should go to a furry convention. i was immediately like fuck no. never in my life, but she told me about an anime con that i regularly attended that next year would be sharing the same venue and weekend as a furry convention. just table hop, she said. she told me to split her table with her, try it out, see how i fared. i already had a table at the anime con, so i was like sure, why the hell not? what could it hurt? we decided to even share a hotel room. this isnt uncommon. in artist alleys many artists room share together since we have similar schedules and dont tend to party hard because we are working. she seemed like a good person and its not uncommon to just meet someone irl when youre rooming with them. i arrived thursday before the con, but the furry con had already started. i got a text from my friend to come sit at her table in the furry con dealers den for a few hours since my con didnt start until friday, just to see if it clicked. she had already checked in to the hotel room and had the keys anyways, so i picked up my badge and went. i was. surprised to find her at the table. in full fursuit. they was the weird part. she was a self hating furry, or so she claimed, so to go full commitment and be in a suit was. ok. hmm. i was already out of my comfort zone in the sea of furries, and my friend was supposed to be like my anchor, my guide through this other world to protect me from this shit. i was immediately on edge. it got worse when i sat down and introduced myself and she did that. thing. that thing that furries do where they are in fur suits and dont talk. she nodded when i made sure she was who i thought she was, but she just did the overly exaggerated cute poses and even had a fucking squeaky toy in her fursuit to make noise. but she didnt say a word. she hugged me, and somehow??? managed to interact with customers who all knew her and adored her (i guess she was well know in the community) and if she wanted to communicate, would write. or text in this big ass oaw things. she said she hates wearing suits but because she doesnt have to talk in them, she doesnt have to interact much with customers. okay. that i could kind maybe believe. sort of. at around 7 pm we packed up to leave to go to the hotel room. she stayed in suit the whole way up. in the room i flopped down on my bed exhausted. i asked her if she was going to come out of that thing, understandably a little freaked out. from this whole thing. then she did the thing that made me want to run out of the room, which i didnt against my better judgment. i had flopped on the bed with the upper half of my body, my feet still on the floor, my shirt had ridden up my torso. she stepped in between my legs and fucking tickled me on my exposed belly. i flipped the fuck out, as one does when sneak attacked by tickles and wriggled out of her reach. she made that laughing pose that furries do where they hold their paws to their mouths bashfully but still silent as fuck. i was so creeped out. my go to way of handling stress like that is laughing it off nervously. she got the hint and motioned she was going to get a shower. as soon as she was in the shower i decided i didnt want to be there when she got out, for now. but instead of lugging all my stuff i decided i would come back for it, preferably with friends. but i needed a key, so i went to her wallet she had taken out of one of her suit pockets, and tried to find the keys i had seen her slip in to her wallet. and of course as soon as i opened it i just had to see her id. i just had to, i was too curious not too. and when i opened it i looked at the id slot and i flipped. my. shit. whoever was in that id was not in any way who i was expecting to see on that picture. i didnt know the super personal details of my friend besides her name and age and general descriptive factors. mid 20s, white girl, etc. that was not who was on this id. it was a man, with long greasy hair, glasses, and stubble, in his mid 40 or early 50s id wager. i was so fucking shocked that i literally threw the wallet across the room after grabbing a key and ran the fuck out of that hotel room. i took fifteen flights of stairs down to the lobby and called up a friend who was coming to the con freaking out. i never saw the real person under the suit. my friend, a tall burly scary looking dude, went up for my stuff later that night with the key id grabbed. when he came back with all my things, he said there was no one in the room. i stayed with him in his room that weekend, and kept only to the convention my friend didnt have a badge to get in to unless i was with a group outside of it. the next night i deleted my furaffinity account, blocked my friend on my chat app, and deleted every connection i had to the furry world. the money be damned. i would never venture in to that mess again. to this day, that event still makes me sweat man. i have some really awful, funny, and silly con stories from my time as a traveling con artist, and this and one other incident top the list as the worst(tm). i have still not recovered. and that was how i almost became like the op in the image, but got out just in time (i hope) before anything terrible happened. tl;dr: i got catfished(??) by a furry and probably almost became a victim of some sort. all over furry art and my greed for that good good furry money. its not worth it. dont do it friends. i dont want to mention con names and stuff but if you googled furry and anime con happens at same hotel im sure you can find the magical con this happened at.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"this happened when dial up was at its prime. i was young, self destructive and couldn't care less. i just wanted to meet new people and have fun. i joined a chatroom and ended up finding someone who lived in my smallish town. we chatted for six months before agreeing to meet up. he was very aware that i was 14 at the time we started chatting, and i knew he was 30 something. at the time i thought he cared like a brother or a dad figure. i didn't know he was grooming me. it was just nice to be able to talk to someone who seemed like they cared about me. we decided to meet up for coffee for one day. we agreed to meet up at night a couple days days later. the whole time leading up to it he was saying he was nervous and scared. i couldn't figure out why he would be scared or nervous. he picks me up a block away from house. first red flag i actually noticed. i get into the car and realize he is one of my brothers high school teachers. i had met this guy before at a open house and he was really nice. so, i put the red flags on pause. we kind of laughed that we had met before and didn't realize it. as we are talking he passed by the coffee place. he says i have a better place in mind. he drove us 15 miles outside of town in a country like area and pulled over. this area of town was rarely ever populated by moving traffic. we were alone and there was no way out. at this point i knew what was going to happen. i thought to myself ""great, now i'm an after school special"". he said that my top was really sexy and started to touch my breast. he began to kiss me and held my hands down with force. you guys can imagine what happened after that. he was kind about it (as kind as this situation could be) until i got up the courage to say no. then he turned into a monster. i thought he would leave me for dead on the side of the road. after it was over a wave of remorse hit him. he apologized for getting so rough. he begged me not to ruin his life. i promised that i would never say a word to anyone and that i wanted it. he said he needed to hear me say i wanted it. it was pure survival mode at that point. i would have said anything to get out of there alive. once he felt reassured i wouldn't tell. he helped clean me up (i was a bloody mess) and dropped me off a block away from home. so, that's my horror story. don't trust people you meet off the internet."

[SEP]	when i was about 30 and living in nyc a girl on okcupid started messaging me. she said she was 21, a student at nyu, and was into anime and all sorts of other wonderful nerdiness (i should mention i am part asian so online dating would get all the weeaboos). but what was strange was her pictures. looked like a model. it seemed like there was no way this redheaded model contacted me out of the blue. we started texting. shed text me all the time. and started sending pictures. of her cat, her shoes, her fingernails. never a full shot of her. and then she started calling me. we would actuslly have great conversations and she seemed like some parts of her stories were true. she shared an apartment with other girls and she would interact with them (and i would hear them talk bsck) during our conversations. however the pictures of the redhead she sent me. in the photo properties were pictures several years old (so definitely not her). i even had a female friend point out her fingernails were rounded but the redheads were squared as evidence. anyway i pushed to meet her and she disappeared. the strangest part of the story was i would talk about this mystery, sometimes on other dates. and one of them had previously dated a writer (an asian guy) and shared with me a short story he wrote about his experience with the same girl. that a redhead contacted him, started texting, calling, etc then disappeared forever.

[SEP]	this was about 16 years ago. i (26f)was talking to a guy online and we were calling each other back and forth. he lived in nj and i lived in mass. we finally decided to meet so he drove up here from new jersey. my friend was working at a laundromat at the time so i decided it was safe place for us to meet there. after hours of waiting, he pulled into the parking lot in an old beat up car with all his belongings in the back seat and he looked about 50 years old. he was pretty scary and i was pretty freaked out. i guess he thought he was moving in which was no way happening as i had a roommate. what he told me on the phone he was a few years older than me and i never saw a picture. i guess i was very trusting because everything he told me, i believed. good thing i decided to meet him last minute in a public place. i had to tell him that i was not interested and he needed to leave that night. that was such a bad situation.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	a couple of years ago this girl messaged me on reddit saying she really connected with a comment i made about first seeing the ocean because she had just gone through a similar experience. she was going to come down to chicago to visit a friend of hers and asked for suggestions of things to do. i gave her a bunch and then we kept talking and finding out we had more and more in common. we eventually started talking over the phone and text messages and when she came down we went out for burgers and beer. we kept talking every day after that and i was really starting to like her. she said she wanted to come down to chicago again and if she could stay with me. i told her of course and a few weeks later she was here for saturday and sunday. really it was mostly sunday because she got in late on saturday and fell asleep on my couch. the next day we went to the zoo and had a really amazing day. after that we came back to my place and decided to go to the brewery nearby which made a beer that had her name in it. we went there and then ended up barhopping through until we ended up near the dive bar by my apartment. we drank and played pool there and eventually grabbed some to-go beers and headed back. i asked if she wanted to see the place by the river i liked to go and drink and think. we sat and eventually started making out and decided to head back to my apartment. we hooked up and then the next day went to the south side to get breakfast at a place she really liked near her friend's apartment before she had to drive back. we kept talking after that and i was planning on coming up to visit her in detroit, but then one day she just ghosted me out of no where. not as horrible as some other stories, but it was really shitty for me because i actually really liked this girl and to this day i have no idea why she stopped talking to me. edit: she's definitely not dead, we followed each other on instagram and i saw that she was okay a bit after she ghosted me. edit 2: went digging and was actually able to find [the message thread](https://i.imgur.com/ipjp7xi.png) for those of you that don't believe me.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	oh! okay, when i was 14, i applied for jobs around my local area online. most places didn't get back to me because i was a child. except for one man who ran a printing shop who wanted to talk to me on msn . i was eager for the job so i began chatting to him. he was late 50s and seemed friendly. after a week or so of talking, he wanted to interview me in person. i jumped at the chance. the day of the interview, i dressed painstakingly neat and smart . he led me around the back of the shop and upstairs to a small room. i already had major misgivings at this point but was too afraid to back out. he locked us both in that room together and turned a camera on to face me. i don't remember much of what was said, but he forced himself onto me and then came all over my smart clothes. i was in shock and really shut down, but i remember the bizarre thought of how he'd ruined my clothes. so yeah, there's a vile video of me out there as a teenager being abused by an old man and i never reported it because my mother beat the shit out of me for messing up my clothes.

""no, i have a headache, beer will make it worse."" we did karaoke, it was unremarkable, we went home. the next day, betty flew home. she just changed her ticket and bounced. she gave us the details in a filtered livejournal entry, saying that adam wouldn't stop hitting on her and she didn't feel comfortable being in the same hotel as him. we all blocked him."

[SEP]	"warning: long post. tldr at the bottom. &#x200b; i owned a minecraft server in middle school, and my friend and i were playing when we met this girl who was around our age. she and i became really close friends because we were both extremely suicidal at the time and both needed someone to emotionally depend on. &#x200b; fast forward until my junior year of high school. she and i had corresponded over the years, albeit not consistently, and she was still the only human i could talk to about my depression. we start talking again, and after a few days, she says she loves me. i explain that i really like her as a friend, but i'm not interested in an online relationship. in response, she threatens to kill herself if i don't love her, so i cave and tell her i love her. &#x200b; it escalated from there. she would ask me to send nudes or masturbate with her over skype, neither of which i was comfortable with at all, but when i would tell her ""no"", she would threaten to kill herself again, say i didn't care for her, act extremely hurt, etc. so, being young and stupid, i started doing the things she asked (with the promise that she doesn't save anything), and i started having panic attacks every day. &#x200b; she started demanding more and more of my time, and i basically disappeared from real life until the end of the school year. still, nobody knew what was going on - i kept it all a secret out of embarrassment. she tells me to visit her or she'll kill herself (keep in mind we live a 15-hour drive apart). so, i tell my parents i want to visit colleges in her region, and they let me drive out there on my own. i spent around a week with her, and i finally realized the difference between real love and pressure/fear/dependency. &#x200b; at last, i drive home from my journey, and she gets even more crazy, demanding that i come to visit her again and that i introduce her to my real-life friends. my panic attacks and suicidal thoughts got even worse, and i eventually found my neck at the end of a rope in my closet. it was only then i realized how toxic the relationship was, and i decided to cut it off rather than end my life. &#x200b; a whole bunch of stuff went down when i broke up with her. it turned out she was saving my nudes the entire time, and she would send them to my friends and try to break into my accounts using my nudes as a ransom. i lost a bunch of friends because of it. i started drinking to cope with the panic attacks the ordeal had left me with (in addition to preexisting stuff), but fortunately, my more supportive friends saw a problem found me a therapist i could go to without telling my parents. for the most part, things slowly got better after that, and i haven't heard from her since. &#x200b; tldr; &#x200b; met a girl online who pressured me to masturbate with her over skype and visit her 15 hours away which caused me to have daily panic attacks. she then sent my nudes to my friends and tried to break into my online accounts."

(i was an 18 year old girl, he was a 24 year old guy.) i pick dave up from the airport, and he just seems.off. i dont really know how to describe it. just off. something definitely weird about the dude. i just figure its nerves and brush it aside. we get to my place and he immediately starts trying to get me drunk. i may have been a stupid 18 year old kid, but i wasnt stupid enough to get wasted with some weird dude in my living room i barely know. i tell him i'm ready to go to bed. i go lay on one couch, let dave have the other. just as i'm starting to fall asleep, i hear dave quietly walking up behind me. dude literally sticks his hand down my pants and tries to touch and rub me. i was terrified so i pretended i was still asleep and pushed him away. eventually, he quit trying. i didnt sleep a wink that night. i took dave back to the airport the next day, he tried to kiss me. i acted like i didnt notice and got the fuck away from him as fast as possible. ended up having to change my number to get him to stop calling me. fuck you, dave.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	no where near as bad as the others on this post but, we used to have this skype group for certain people that liked a certain show about colourful horses, so we could talk about the show and art and make friends in general. somehow managed to find people that actually lived pretty locally to me so we arranged a day that we would meet up (me and 2 guys well call them johnny and joseph) i was about 18 at the time so figured i would be fine going without one of my other girl friends to stick to me. the initial meet up was great we talked and walked and just sort of enjoyed the time. eventually johnny went home because it was already getting late. so joseph and i walk around some more just chatting normally. we are walking really far away, i dont know the area but apparently he does so we just go. soon i need to pee so i ask joseph if he knows somewhere i can go use the bathroom. he tells me his house is nearby so we can drop by there. im kind of getting desperate at this point so i agree. it takes about five minutes to walk to his place. its in a pretty dodgy area so im pretty spooked already at this point. i go to the bathroom and he tells me he will be in the room 2 doors down. so when i finish up in the bathroom i go to find him. its his bedroom and hes on the computer. do you want to watch me play tf2? he says to me. i say ok as long as its not too long because its getting dark outside. i watch him play and my anxiety is just through the roof. he then puts on some horror game knowing full well because we discussed it earlier that i am terrified of horror games. so not only am i anxious but i am scared shitless and on the verge of tears. i ask again a bit more sternly (im a shy coward so speaking up like this is really out of character for me) can i go home now? no joke now dude turns around and asks do you wanna make out? at this point i am completely speechless and am frozen in place. dude has condoms on the bed just ready like as if he was expecting me to say yes before i even came to the room. of course i just say uh no and walk my way out of that situation. im so glad it didnt go further than that because like it really could have been worse. the walk home was really scary too, it was dark and after that i decided i was never going to meet people without someone else there again.

[SEP]	"do i, ever. buckle up y'all, it's a long one. when i was 11, there was a game website that had chatrooms. you could play games with other people and chat alongside the game, etc. there weren't a lot of younger kids on the site, and i never usually talked to anyone. until i saw one day this kid (we'll call him a) said he was 12, so i started talking to him because i had never seen another kid play on the website at that point. we ended up becoming friends and began talking on aol im. my mom was super skeptical of the whole thing so we asked him to write my name on a piece of paper and then take a picture with it. my mom seemed satisfied after that and never questioned it again. our friendship was only ever platonic. we stayed friends for about three years and kept connected through the game website and myspace. when facebook came around, i stopped using myspace and lost track of him after that. cut to a few years later and i'm now in college. i was in a three hour long class and decided to bring my laptop with me, which i never ever did. during our fifteen minute break, i decided to check my twitter account, which was inactive and i hadn't used in years. i saw that there was a message from a from like two weeks before and instantly messaged him back, not believing it was him. but it was and we reconnected. he was dating this girl from his hometown but wasn't happy. i was single and away at school, ten hours from home while my mother was dying from an unknown illness at the time. a was there for me at any hour of the day/night and comforted me when things were bleak and not looking good for my mom. we made plans for new year's (i live in new york and he lived in kentucky) to go see the ball drop in the city and finally meet for the first time, but i was broke and december was really rough for my mom, so i cancelled. i quit school to take care of my mom and because i was so busy with her, we didn't talk as much. i started dating this guy and stopped talking to a altogether. it didn't last long and a messaged me after i had changed my relationship status back to single on facebook. he told me he also had broken up with his girlfriend and from that point on, we were ""talking"". we would be on the phone for hours, texting all day and night. we would download movies on our laptops and press play at the same time so we could watch it ""together"". he would call up starbucks at the mall i worked in and buy me a drink over the phone, then tell me to go pick it up. he connected with my mom on facebook to wish her well in her illness. he was in my opinion perfect. and i was falling hard. this went on for months. the week before my 20th birthday, my best friend told me we were going out to dinner with her boyfriend and a few of his friends that she wanted to try to hook me up with. she knew about a but didn't know it was ""serious"". i wasn't really interested but she kept bugging me and bugging me so i relented. we go to dinner and a walks in with my best friends boyfriend instead of his friends. my heart dropped into my stomach and started doing the cha cha slide. he had contacted my best friend weeks before and wanted to surprise me for my birthday. he stayed for a whole week. we went to the local aquarium, the beach (he had never seen the ocean before), got slurpees (they don't have 7-elevens where he's from) and went to dave and buster's, went paintballing. it was amazing. we kissed the night before he left and i was heart broken he was leaving. he told me he would be back. the next day, he messaged my dad (whom i live with) and told him that he wanted to be with me and wanted to know if my dad could help him move to new york so that he could do that. my dad, impressed at the speech and how i was treated the week a was there, told him he could live with us rent free if he helped my dad with his business (i live on a poultry farm). it was labor intensive but a was extremely adamant about moving to ny to be with me. so he did. a month later, he drove his little car from kentucky to ny with his dog and all his belongings. the first night he was there, he had run out to his car to get something. our phones, both iphones, were next to each other and one of them beeped. thinking it was mine, i picked it up and saw there was a text from e. e was his exgirlfriend. the text said ""i miss my whalenugget"". i was super confused and slightly disgusted (whalenugget???) but he had just driven 9 hours, hundreds of miles with all of his belongings and his dog. i didn't sweat it and never mentioned it to him. the first two weeks were heaven. i lost my virginity to him. fell in love. finished the summer with a new job, and new confidence. he was working with my dad and that was going well. my mom was on the mend finally and things were just going really good. then he started getting phone calls from his mother saying how much she missed him, how could he leave her, why would he do this to her, etc. she would make passive aggressive facebook statuses, would message me and ask for him. it was overwhelming, especially only a few weeks into the relationship, and it was every single day. ""how could you leave me, my baby!"" gag. something changed about a month in. we had been having sex every single night and then it went to a few nights and then it stopped completely. we had been squeezing onto my twin mattress but suddenly he wanted the couch instead. he would blow my dad off to go fishing every single day, all day long. didn't want to hang out with my friends anymore. and was always always on his phone. this went on for another two weeks before he finally broke the news to me that his mother was falling into a deep depression and that he was going to have to move back home. i was devastated. he moved back home and the next day on facebook he was back in a relationship with e. which was funny because him and i had never broken up.we had kissed goodbye and had sex the night before even. i received a message from e on facebook that they had never broken up, hat it was just a ""break"" and that he needed to find himself, but he did and that's why he moved back home. i was furious that i had been used for the last two months. i was furious that he was an amazing liar. she sent me screenshots of conversations they had during the two months he lived with me. making fun of my weight during sex, how bored he was there and how he couldn't wait to go home. every single thing he had told me, was a fucking lie. i don't remember how it started but he started posting pictures that he took of me unknowingly on twitter. and these were really really unflattering pictures. one in particular that has stuck with me was a picture of me and his dog on my couch that he tweeted to national geographic and said ""look @natgeo, a whale is eating my dog!"" another one read ""we all have that one fat bitch we've slept with. guilty as charged."" for 10 months, this was every single day. back then, you could block someone on twitter but all blocking did was prevent the person from @ing you. i could still see all the tweets and morbid curiousity got me every single time. didn't matter how many times i reported him to twitter, they never took the tweets or his account down. pictures i hadn't known he had taken. he had gone through my diary and posted entries on his facebook that he and his friends and family commented and laughed at me on. eventually i stopped caring. i stopped looking at his social media accounts. i met someone else and eventually moved on. hindsight really is 20/20. i wish i could go back and slap myself for ignoring the whalenugget bullshit. i would have saved myself a lot of heartache."

[SEP]	so, i got catfished once. i was 15, used this app/virtual chat world called imvu on the pc. i was a pretty sheltered kid, still very hopeful and naive about the world, but i loved helping people. one day im on there and i meet this girl named morrow, she was the real gothic type and i was really into alternative girls. we started chatting every day, eventually i met her brother justin, and her close friend norma. we all chatted on this imvu website, sometimes played games on steam, hung out over skype. it was pretty great i even started dating morrow. so, after dating for about a year she hits me with some weird shit, about her being a vampire and how shes over 2000 years old. basically the vampire from those christopher pike novels. now to preface here, this was around the time twilight got big, vampires were all the rage, and i was super naive so i still believed that almost anything could be possible, maybe. so i tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, especially when her brother and friend are saying yeah she's totally a vampire and treated it as if it were some big family secret. (i know, fucking stupid in retrospect but i was young and really naive). fast forward a couple years i'm 17, still dating her and believing she is a vampire with this long history and a family. even believed that maybe i had talked to god about it because of another set of circumstances in which a random number texted me and i asked about these things, and the other textee, or texter?.anyway the person who texted me seemed to understand all of this stuff that i was hiding from basically everyone i knew, because i knew on some level that it all sounded crazy as fuck. the short of it was i was just willing to believe and i loved morrow. i was in my first year of college down in tn at this point, and i decided i was finally going to meet morrow in person. only one problem, she lived in mt, hence why i hadnt met her up to this point (although we had exchanged pictures throughout our relationship. i'd even gotten supposed pictures of all of her and said family together) so, i used my savings to move out to mt, but i was supposed to be moving with her 24 year old brother, justin. i wouldn't be able to see her for several more months due to her taking a long trip to india to visit her ancestral vampire roots. again, i know it sounds insane, but you see where this is going. eventually, we move in with other people, they help me to figure out that justin was the only one who ever existed. i was 18 at this point so i had spent 3 years believing in this whole interconnected network of at least 8 people by now, but it turns out old justin had been pulling the strings the whole time. just keeping up the charade, finding pictures online, oh and using all these different fakes to gang up against me when id start to question things. i began to put the pieces all together, so i kicked him out of my house, and thats when he decided to tell me he had fallen in love with me. such a piece of shit person who killed a part of me that i'll never get back. definitely dont catfish people, its a shitty thing to do	[SEP]	96
[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	met a girl online once. can't remember where but this was 15-20 years ago. we chatted for a while and seemed to hit it off. eventually she invited me to her house. turns out she was having a party with about 30 people. she pretty much ignored the whole time i was there. hung out with some cool people and played some mario kart. left when everyone else started to. never spoke to her again. i have a lot of online communities i'm involved in between some forums i'm active in and ffxi. i wasn't there for it but a bunch of my ffxi friends got together one weekend 10-15 years ago. one of them got drunk off his ass, trashed some stuff, and made everyone else miserable. he never got invited again. the most prominent one was where i got cockblocked by 9/11. i had a trip cross country lined up for a car show and meet up with a bunch of people from a forum i was on. i had been talking to a girl out there for months beforehand and it had gotten pretty hot and heavy. so i planned to go out for the show then hang out with her for a week or so after. i also had some work to do out there but it was mostly to hang out with her. 9/11 happened the tuesday before the trip. i ended up on one of the first flights out of town that thursday. 90% of the group canceled their trips though. when i landed she sent someone else to pick me up and she was nowhere to be found. i saw her at the show for about 5 minutes but besides that she ghosted me. i heard from her after a few days. her ex and her had gotten back together after 9/11 happened because life is short let's try it again etc. i spent most of the trip in my hotel room watching the first x-men movie on hbo. it was a surreal experience all around. they're not all horror stories though. through the same group i made friends with another girl out of state. we hung out a few times but figured out we click better as friends. i met her best friend on one of my trips and we started talking online constantly. she flew down one weekend to see how we'd get along in person. we've been married 14 years just about so i guess it worked out.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	not a horror story but i thought this thread could use some positivity! i met my best friend online, through a mutual friend whom i met on an mmo. she was from the philippines and i was from canada (we started talking right as i was immigrating from romania.) she added me on yahoo messenger 8 years ago and we talked or video called every single day since then. once smartphones became a thing, we would video call whenever our time zones matched up, or message each other on messenger. we were the same age and both were being bullied in school. she would stay up all night while i was hiding on breaks crying at school to video call me, then i would go home, take a nap, and then stay up all night on video call with her while she was at school dealing with her own bullies. it was the closest we could get to hanging out and hiding from our bullies together. she was the only person i opened up to about my darkest thoughts that i couldn't tell anyone else. she let me talk about things for hours and understood me on a level no one else ever did. she got me through the worst years of my life and is a big reason why i'm still here today. i noticed she loved doing her makeup since she was a preteen, and she was bullied a lot for it. i knew she couldn't afford nice makeup where she was, so i sent her a starter set of professional makeup because i genuinely thought she had talent. she is now the biggest and most in demand makeup artist in her region, recently started working for celebrities and major magazines. to this day she kept the first set of makeup brushes i sent her. we've been each other's person for almost a decade now, through thick and thin. since we're both 23/24 now and could afford it and also could make our own decisions, we finally met for the first time in hong kong over christmas. we stayed there for a month and literally had the time of our lives. didn't feel at all like we were meeting for the first time, it was like we'd always been neighbours and just grew up together. i was afraid that it might ruin our friendship, but i knew that we had to take that step to meet in person, since we were basically family. we've had our fair share of fights through the years, but ultimately, we loved each other enough to always talk things through for as long as it was necessary to sort things out. i genuinely believe we'll be friends for life. the internet is genuinely a wonder that we don't appreciate enough!

[SEP]	"not me, but my sister liked/likes to do online dating or whatever. well she met this one guy who she liked and met. they dated and he even came to my and my husband's wedding. randomly one night she ran away from home. wouldn't answer her phone. house was unlocked. stuff missing. when she finally contacted someone, it was my husband. the way she was texting didn't sound like her at all. she was never one to just openly say stuff like ""i love you"". when she started texting us that's what she kept saying. i questioned it and she responded with saying that she just never said it enough. (keep in mind we only had text contact. never heard her voice). time went by (maybe few days) and she contacted our mother and said she was pregnant. turned out that guy had knocked her up, convinced her to run away, verbally abused her, and tried to keep her from having any contact from us by trying to keep her phone away from her. one day she was able to get in contact with our mother and tell her to pick her up."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	met a guy on an online game. we were in the same guild. i thought we were just friends and doing quests and stuff. he kept pestering me about getting skype and doing voice chat. i finally agreed to voice chat but never video chat. then he wanted my facebook. that wasnt going to happen so i lied and said i didnt have one. i didnt want some guy ive only sort of known for a few months to know my full name, family, home town etc. once he finally dropped the facebook thing then he kept badgering me about sending him pics. hed send me pictures of himself, luckily nothing lewd, but demanded pictures of me to reciprocate. one day i just blocked him and deleted my voice chat account. he made me stop playing online games for a while. a couple months later i decided i wanted to get back into the online game. my account was filled with messages from him telling me how i had led him on and i was his true love. immediately blocked him on there as well. then the guild leader got all why are you being so mean to him?? he told us you blocked him for no reason and wont talk to him! i just left the guild. havent gotten back on in months :( i miss the game but i dont miss the weirdos.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i was probably the 'horror' of the story. posted this before and, for what it's worth, i'm not proud of what i did. met a girl my age in a chatroom when i was 16. we'd talk every day and things got 'serious' in a puppy love kind of way. i'd only ever seen once picture of her, which was in black and white but when she floated the idea of me coming to spend the week with her whilst her parents were away, i booked a ticket and travelled several hours on the train to go see her. she was waiting for me when the taxi pulled up and my heart sank. she looked a lot heavier than her picture suggested and i wasn't attracted to her. at all. to top it off, the house i had to spend the next week smelled like dog. for some reason we put lethal weapon 4 on for us to watch and it was during the film that i decided i'd probably made a mistake and had to leave as soon as i could. the next day probably would have been too soon, so i decided in on the day after next. the part i'm least proud of is sneaking into her room before my taxi arrived and erasing my number in her phone. *then*, on realising that the majority of messages in her phone were from me and that she'd still have number, i snuck back into her room and deleted all those messages. the taxi came and i went home and never spoke nor heard from her again. not a nice thing to do at all. i'm sorry emily, you deserved so much better.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"i met him playing online poker. when i was a freshman in high school, my friend and i would play texas hold 'em online and go in the chatroom and just say dumb shit and joke around. ask if a 7 and a 2 were a good hand, that kind of thing. well this guy, we'll call him harry, started joining in with us and getting up to the same antics. we got some dude really mad at us so my friend and i decided to switch poker tables and go annoy someone else. we invited harry to come along with us and he did. from that point on, i was really good friends with him. he lived in a far away state and was maybe a year or two older than me. we talked online all the time. he was most definitely one of my best friends and i confided in him and trusted him completely. we had a similar sense of humor and things just made sense between us. i'd tell my irl friends about him and he would often talk to them too. i had several other online only friends that i would just chit chat with and it never seemed too weird to me but i was definitely closest with harry. there was never anything romantic between harry and i. things were always very platonic but i had always found him attractive. i figured he found me attractive as well but it really wasn't important. we finally met each other in person while i was in college after years of being friends online. he me me at a public place where i worked. he had a friend that lived in the same city as me and was visiting. he told me i was taller than he was expecting. things seemed normal. i went out with him and his friend that night to bar hop. got pretty drunk. his friend was very entertaining and outspoken. harry was more my speed. after having a fun night, his friend had picked up some loud girl and the 4 of us went back to the friend's apartment. we hung out in the living room for a short time but then the friend went into his bedroom and started loudly having sex with the girl he had picked up. harry and i laughed about it, it could have been awkward but it wasn't. we were both drunk. something intimate could have sparked between us. but it didn't. i had a boyfriend and wasn't the type to cheat. we spent some time together and then i caught a cab home. the ""horror"" part of this story is that nothing ever came of us. timing was wrong. distance was wrong. if this were a movie, we would have gotten together. i like to imagine sometimes that it was. he now lives in the same state as me but still too far away for it to matter. he is married and lives a much more active life than i do. i have been in the same relationship for several years. the saddest part is we no longer talk. i think we hit a turning point when we met plus he no longer could handle the emotional instability i went through in my late college years. still wonder what could have been. for the 2 people who read through this, thanks for reading."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	obligatory not me but this literally just happened with my dad. so my dad is really into road bicycling and is in some triathlete groups on facebook, where he apparently made friends with some pro cyclist from portugal. this dude from portugal posts in the facebook group saying he's moving to my parents' city in the u.s. to train for his triathlons and asks if he can stay with anyone for a couple months while he finds a place and gets on his feet. my dad gets all excited about this and asks my mom if the guy can move in for a few months and my mom for some reason agrees, i think just because all of us kids are out of the house now and they do have a lot of extra space. fast forward to two months after this guy arrives, my mom has been getting super weird vibes from him and is getting anxious for him to move out and find his own place, but my dad is apparently having a great time with this guy as their roommate and is in no hurry for the guy to leave. my mom gets frustrated and decides she thinks there's something weird with this guy and googles him. the google search reveals he was convicted of felony credit card fraud in portugal 2 years ago after hacking his friends computer and stealing over 10,000 euros from his bank account. not only that, but she keeps searching and finds like 3 more convictions for various different fraud schemes he had been convicted for. the schemes were always to steal from friends of his too, which seemed like the most fucked up part to me. my mom ended up confronting him with it and asking him to move out asap, so the guy is supposed to leave tomorrow but i told my parents to hide their valuables, put their credit cards on lockdown, and change their banking passwords. super sketchy.

[SEP]	"not me, but a friend of mine met someone on the internet when we were fresh out of middle school. the guy he was talking to online claimed to be the same age as us and wanted to hang out sometime. so my friend invites me to tag along and i warn him thats not a good idea because it could be someone dangerous pretending to be a kid. we faught and argued and i was eventually forced to tag along to meet up with this online person. so we show up, and this guy is in his 40s. he walks up to my friend and greets him. then the guy looks at me and seductively licks his lips, grinning like hes looking at fresh meat or something.i backed away as slowly as i could and the guy touches me and says, ""don't go! i just want to talk."" my friend is all warm and friendly with the guy and chats to him like a normal person. so after a few mins or so, my friend and i leave and the strange thing is, he still wants to be friends with the online guy. &#x200b; a month goes by and i get a strange e-mail asking for some personal info. i decline many times and the guy goes apeshit on me, complaining about how i'm being rude. he sends me some inappropriate content and i blocked him on my e-mail. a few days later he finds my personal facebook and sends me a friend request. i have no idea how he found me and i decline the request. again he goes apeshit on me and rants about how if i don't add him as a friend, he'll make my life a living hell. i ignore it. next thing i know, my facebook friends stop talking to me because hes been harassing them, trying to get my personal info. i had enough with this guy and i do some research. next thing i know, i learn he's a convicted sex offender. i confront the guy online about this and he says that an ex of his framed him for a crime he didn't do. i call bs on it and i warned him, if he talks to me again, i'd report him to the police. &#x200b; fatass here doesn't get the big picture so he continues to message me with sexual messages like ""how big is your dick?"" and ""are you gay?"" and ""have you done anal?"" and other strange questions. keep in mind this goes on and on for a while. i had enough and report the guy to the police. police ask for evidence. i pull out the chat to see that the guy has been deleting his fb messages. anyways i report him to facebook and his account gets deleted a day later. few days later he makes another fb account and sends me a friend request. i don't bother replying to his sexual messages and report him to facebook again. a month later he sends me a new friend request on his third fb account. i report him to fb once again. his account is deleted.have i won the battle? close. &#x200b; so i take a break from fb and spend some time on twitter. little did i know, he has a twitter account and followed me and sent a series of sexual messages to me over a long period of time. normally i don't read dms, but i deleted all of the messages and blocked him on twitter. i tried reporting him to twitter but they don't do anything about it. hi twitter is still active. ugh. &#x200b; fast forward to 2 years ago. my irl friend calls me sobbing. i ask whats wrong. he apologizes for dragging me with him to meet the online guy. he says he should've listened to me and how it was wrong to chat with the guy online in the first place. to make matters worse, he says the online guy has been calling him, saying sexual things to him. anyways i tell him to report online person to the police. friend says hes too scared because no one will believe him. i tell my friend to block the number and just ignore him. so in the end, my friend unfriends the online guy and to this day, we haven't heard a peep from him. &#x200b; tl;dr: friend met a guy online. drags me in. got catfished. guys a pedo. a series of unfortunate events unfold. i win the battle."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	late to the party, but i met an online friend of 2-ish years in person while helping a friend from school move. we had met on an old school roleplay chat and eventually moved to skyping, since we both liked crafting. we both lived alone at the time, so we'd put on movies and sit and crochet or whatever, and that was a big chunk of our relationship. she was 24 and i was 22. she seemed lonelier than me and spent a lot of time bemoaning how she had no friends or money. she had bought a house by herself at 21 and was part of multiple mlms. i liked her enough that i just politely turned down all her offers to buy weight loss shakes and makeup. she was always angling for me to come visit, so when the opportunity came up, i let her know that i was helping a friend move a few hours away, so we'd be passing through. she graciously offered for us to crash at her place on the way. turned out, she lived in the middle of this very 50s suburban neighborhood, in a one-bedroom house *with no doors*. on any of the rooms. she'd spent all her money trying to live this facebook mom group life, despite being a single 20-something, so the house itself was basically empty with pillows on the floor in lieu of furniture. she had no bathroom door or table, but she had an expensive coffee maker and a metric ton of weight loss shakes. she was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag. she never had anyone over, because she barely had friends in real life, so her house was staged to keep up appearances with her mom friends online, and not really meant to be lived in. we decided to be polite and make do, but the bathroom was facing the living/bed area such that you had to look dead into the house if you sat on the toilet. whenever one of us needed to pee and eventually shower, the others just walked outside. naturally, i got massive stomach cramps at like 3 am and had to crawl up and take the stealthiest, most painful poop of my life while looking over the bodies of my sleeping friends.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"started playing a mud in high school. basically a text-based adventure game, the game was based on the book franchise ""discworld"". i really enjoyed it, and so did a number of my mates. one of my friends actually introduced it to one of his friends, i'll call him john. &#x200b; john was very addicted and got a lot more immersed in the game than any of us ever could. and because of this he was basically 'powering' us through the game. through his travels, he met a girl on there that called herself katie. katie sent us pictures of herself, told us she was from new zealand. she slowly injected herself in to our msn groups and added us all one by one. we were all like 14-15+ at the time, so it was somewhat interesting having a girl in our calls who liked video games like us, until she started having private conversations with us separately. she never spoke on voice, as she didn't have a mic and was always very quick on text. mostly every conversation was a competitive ""1-up"" battle, where she'd talk about how great she was at seemingly everything. renown ballet dancer? check. beyond grade 8 in piano? check. knew 3 different languages? check. i had really really bad eyesight, she had worse. my friend beat halo on legendary, she did it before them. all the while being constantly online. we were a tight knit group and she was starting to divide us all so i think one by one we all got sick of her bullshit and dropped her completely. it's at this point that john kind of disappeared from our lives as well. &#x200b; i started playing wow when it came out and was heavily invested, and at some point a few years later after release. i got a message from a strange person on msn. i can't remember the exact reason but it was something to do with wow. turns out i hadn't blocked/deleted her and she was talking to me about the game. at the time, i was playing a very geared alt character and she would group with me for dungeons. she was very competitive, and i enjoyed talking to her but she was in to some really weird shit. would link me cartoon pictures of herself without limbs, claiming she had an amputation fetish. would ask me that if she wanted to die, would i be the one that did it. she'd link me pictures of her bruised feet from ballet, saying she wants to saw them off. she'd link me her prescription papers, complaining about her vision and claiming that she'd like to get an eye removed so someone could fuck her eye socket. things got darker and darker, until she had a meltdown. i don't really remember what triggered it, but it was heavily implied she was going to kill herself and then i heard nothing for a day. this girl lives on the other side of the world, and i had way more than enough information from her to contact her brother to make sure she was okay. so i did. 'katie' messages me back through google, and has no idea who i am. has never played an online game in her life. is in fact a ballet dancer and teaches piano. and is blind as a bat. turns out one of her male korean friends, from university that she had confided in about her own issues, was using all of this information to form a fake identity. the real katie got the police involved about identity theft and i don't know what happened to the guy. last i heard was he decided to get gender realignment surgery and is still pretending to be other people. &#x200b; the real katie and i became friends though and still talk here and there.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	im not sure if this is the right kind of horror story, but it still bothers me many years later. way way back in the day, i met a guy through online role playing in aol chat rooms. it was never anything questionable, we just had characters and would play out scenarios together. eventually we really got to know each other and friendship became a long distance relationship. we would talk on the phone for hours and send each other packages. our parents spoke at one point, and after chatting for a couple of years, they helped set up for us to meet. everything went well. his dad brought him to my hometown and we actually got to meet. we saw each other a handful of times after that, too. he was my first relationship, and just generally a good friend during a lot of my middle school/high school formative years. eventually we broke up, but continued to be friends and keep in touch. i always thought i would see him again some day. when i was in my 20s, he had a death in the family and i remember talking to him. two or three months later i woke up from dreaming about him at like 4:30 in the morning. i couldnt sleep, so i went online to send him a message that i figured hed get whenever he was next on. so the horror story part, for me, was that i found out that he had been found dead in his apartment a few days before i went to send him that message. he had had a brain aneurism. it was absolutely crushing to know i hadnt made it a priority to see him again and that i would never talk to him again. it still really saddens me when i think about it now, several years later.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i had this online friend back when i was a teen. we hit it off really well and would talk all the time. eventually we decided to meet up irl since we lived pretty close to each other. i had already had some instances where it turned out i was chatting with guys who were 30+ (i was very naive) so when my mom found out she insisted on driving me to our meeting spot and taking us home to hang out. it was a little awkward to sit in the living room with my mom in the room next door, but we made it work and we had fun. it was after that things went wrong. he started to become a little obsessive and stalking me. he'd sent me messages telling me what i was wearing at that moment and where i was. saying he'd kill himself if i stopped talking to him. things like that. it was terrifying, and i stupidly didn't tell my mom. i kept talking to him because i was scared he'd do something - either to himself or me. after some time i got a message from him saying he was joining the army and then i never heard from him again.

[SEP]	not myself personally, but this happened within my friend group. we'd been playing a home brew rpg over a forum we all frequented for a long time. when skype and, later, discord came around we all joined up and became even closer. one day our dm tells the group that he and his girlfriend are being kicked out of the house he shared with his parents. told us they didn't approve of his relationship with her and gave him an ultimatum: break up or be booted out. so we talked about it as a group and eventually one of us decided he and his girlfriend could move in with him. dm and his girlfriend turned out to be a straight up roommates from hell. they refused to get a job so they could even *start* to make the most basic effort to pay for anything. they constantly whined about being hungry and pilfered my friend's food but they frequently let most of what they took go to waste. they absolutely destroyed the room they were staying in. they didn't have a vehicle so the friend had to drive them everywhere whenever they needed something. after about six months the friend couldn't take it anymore and kicked dm and his girlfriend out. but taking care of them destroyed his meager finances, his self confidence, and ultimately their friendship.

[SEP]	he was a semi famous computer programmer, well known, respected, glorified. he lived a frugal life and traveled around countries giving talks about free software and stuff. heard he was coming to my country to give some talks and they wanted people to host him, so i applied and got accepted as a host. the first red flag was the email with a list of 'requirements' - from temperature, humidity, pets, food, drinks (right down to brand names!) etc etc etc - you name it, it was in there. despite that all i moved kids into shared rooms so he could have his own room, set the ac on, and we were set. dude turned up with gf at the time, talked super loud really late at night, got up super early in the morning and loudly stomped about, showeed etc. farted, burped, ate his own snot, or body bits he picked off. he was constantly rude and obnoxious and knew everything, and would argue everything with no leeway or common ground. boy was i glad when he left. on the plus side - after he left the kids never once questioned when i said 'do this - its good manners' - they also requested that guy please never come back. &#x200b; (for the geeks - yes it was rms)	[SEP]	43
[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"i actually have three stories for you, because i'm a dumbass who doesn't learn his lesson. a little background first. i grew up in a cult, had an abusive uncle, and lived with my single mom who had bipolar/schizoaffective disorder. i was awkward as hell, had no social skills or self-confidence, and home life sucked. so let's get to the three. 1) i had been playing an online text-based game with a guy that lived two hours away. i thought he was the coolest guy, really nice. one night my mom bashed my head in with a lamp (she was the sweetest woman when she was well, but violence was common when off her meds)-- bleeding and desperate, i message him about what happened. he told me ""hey, i talked to my parents and we are coming to get you right now"". never met him before, they came and picked me up and i moved in with them. i had a trash bag full of some clothes and nothing else. i had just turned 16 a month before. the very first night i was there the mom got drunk, started ramming her mercedes into the dad's bmw (on purpose), and the son pulled a gun on mom to get her to stop. mom runs off into the night and moved in with her boyfriend (she'd been cheating - dad didn't know until that night). so all three of us are in a bad place. we played monopoly and ate junk food until like 3am. i got a job at walmart, started community college (i got my ged at 16), things seemed ok. the family very generously was letting me live at their place for free. the dad was pretty well off so he didn't bat an eye at taking me to dinner with his son and paying for it, etc. i'd never experienced anything like this in my life, we had always lived hand-to-mouth. about three months in dad gets arrested. apparently he was a prominent member of the ""republic of texas"" movement that wanted to cede from the union, and as a ""sovereign citizen"" hadn't paid his taxes in years. house and cars get seized for back taxes, son goes with his grandma, but i find myself with no place to live. i ended up moving back home. 2) two months after moving back home my mom tried to stab me in the chest with a knife - i caught her wrist in time so it barely broke skin. i decided it was time to leave again. i had been talking to a girl online for about six months. she lived near chicago, i lived in texas. we are both 16. so naturally i think ""i'll take a bus to chicago and get a job there"". because that's what rational teens do, right? i saved up for about a month from my crappy data entry job, didn't tell my mom i was leaving, and went straight to chicago (a small suburb, actually). i knock on the door of the address she gave me (she asked me to come, of course). nobody answers. i call a mutual friend that went to school with her from a pay phone (remember those?), and friend confesses that the girl had catfished me the whole time. she was using the friend's pictures (the girl i went to see was around 300 lbs, not the hot teen she was pretending to be), and both girls thought it was really funny - until i actually showed up. the girl i went to meet eventually did come out and apologized to me profusely, she had been catfishing almost a dozen guys because she was addicted to the attention. hot friend apologized too. i hopped on a bus and went back to texas feeling defeated. 3) home life still sucked. i started talking to another girl online (because i was too awkward for real relationships). she lived in canada. two weeks after my 18th birthday i flew up there thinking ""i'll get a job in canada, everything will be fine"". this was before 9/11 and you didn't need a visa. at airport security in canada i went through customs. apparently i knew nothing about immigration or the law. on the plus side, the girl got to visit me in the airport security holding area before the canadian officials put me on a plane (courtesy of the government since i bought a one-way ticket) back to texas. i was handcuffed on the plane and had a security guard sitting with me all the way back to texas, and told not to come back. it was an interesting experience. shortly after moving back in (for the third time), i had my head bashed in again and a friend from school and his family took me in. i moved to a big city when they moved, got a decent job, and now 16 years and lots of therapy later i can laugh about it all."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	my neighbor had actually done this and it wound up coming to my house this was 2006 or so we(all the kids in the neighborhood) were all around the same age 14-17 and my neighbor had told the social circle that he had made an xbox buddy that didnt live far supposedly from our location and was going to invite him over so we could all meet this cool guy. but i didnt think he was serious bc he says lots of things that never come true or happen ever happened etc. and he exaggerates his stories. i forget about what he said, i think we all did, and it's like a month later in late november,its 20 degrees outside and we get a knock at our door at 11pm at night. it's some goth af kid asking if we knew so and so (our neighbor) he was like 15 and turns out our neighbor had completely ghosted him and went to the beach the weekend they were supposed to meet. his parents had to drive 2 hours to get here and had already left. he couldnt get cell service to call them, so he spent the night with us. my mom felt bad for him bc he seemed really shy and was probably embarrassed af. he turned out to be totally cool. really sweet, loved animals and video games ofc. his parents couldnt or wouldnt come to get him so my stepdad met them half way. well, he doesnt let that deter him and tried to meet up with my neighbor some time later. the same thing happens he comes knocking at my door late at night but hes crying, they had stolen his wallet and broke his cellphone and he was either high or drunk bc he was slurring his speech and unable to stand correctly. my mom calls the police the next day because she didnt even know he was there- i was naive and wasnt sure if he would get in trouble for being high or drunk and made a bed out for him in the living room. i didnt believe him at first about the wallet and phone but my sister said to let him in. cops got called the next day, was lots of stupid drama for that kid and neighbors. it wound up going to court. last i heard the kid went into the marines after hs, is married and is doing good.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	so, not an actual horror story, as it ended well, but still gave me quite a turn. i'd been email buddies/pen pals with this girl since she was 15 and i was 19. when i was about 25, i was staying with my dad and stepmother and it was a really crappy living situation as my stepmom is a full blown entitled narcissist and my dad is an enabler. i basically paid them 150 bucks a month to live in a flea filled corner that was freezing in winter and boiling in summer. because of this and trying to avoid my stepmother, i'd wake up everyday and go to the library for as long as i could and work on my manuscripts and study. literally nothing but a blizzard or thunderstorm or the library being closed kept me home. i turned into a complete workaholic because i hated being in that house. so one day in at the library working away and i keep getting messages from my online friend asking what i was up to. i told her i was working. she kept asking if i wasn't at home. i told her twice nope. i couldn't figure out why she asked. it turned out she had secretly hopped on a plane and shown up at my parent's house. she was like hey i'm celestina's friend can i use your bathroom? which given what stuck up prigs they are is super hilarious to picture. it would be like if one of harry potter's wizard friends showed up at the dursley house. and in all the time i'd lived with them i never had friends, was always alone. bit of a nasty shock for them i imagine. but the girl was persistent and next thing i know she's got my dad escorting her through the library to meet me. lol. she's awesome like that. i did get in a lot of trouble as everybody assumed i'd planned her visit, despite the fact that i knew nothing about it, but otherwise it was great time. also i knew she was going to be loads of fun from the minute i stood up from the library desk and she gasped omygosh you are short! and i was all yeah i warned you. horror story for my folks at any rate.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"okay, so i never really met them in person, but i'm so relieved i didn't. also this is a long story; tl;dr: i really dodged a bullet by not meeting up with these people because they got extremely creepy and expected me to be a.\*ahem\*.""cheerleader,"" despite being 14-15. so, when i was a freshman in high school, my parents finally got me my own computer. i downloaded gmod (cause, you know, that was the ""big thing"" at the time). there, i met my first (and last) online group. there were, like, twelve of us(?), and i was one of three girls. the ring-leader of sorts was this one guy who was a senior in high school. for this story, i'm gonna call him joe (not his real name). now, at the time, my parents were extremely overprotective of me online, as my mother saw the online world as an absolute evil and my dad just went along with what she said because he didn't know much about the platform. so, i wasn't allowed show my face, i couldn't use my real name, and if i played with multiple people, one of my parents had to be in the room so they could make sure i didn't accidentally let any personal information slip. no one in the group even knew how old i was; they assumed i was older because--at the time--i had a deep voice for a fourteen-year-old girl (they assumed i was in college because of this). well, fast forward about a month and the group went from using no cameras at all to always using face cams and even just calling on skype instead of gaming. for a while, they were okay with me not revealing my face, but they assumed i was just shy or self-conscious. it wasn't until then that i accidentally let slip that i was in high school (complaining about a teacher that hated me because i stood up for a girl with a ""fake"" learning disability), and then everyone wondered if it was a good idea to keep me there, as most of them were either seniors in high school or older. now, joe wasn't the oldest (he was a senior in high school himself), but he was the ring-leader, so it was up to him whether or not i stayed. he said it was fine, as he had been a part of this particular group since he was in middle school. now, i'm not exactly sure when this happened because i was kept out of the loop on a lot of things (i was told about this by joe's friend way after this happened), but joe and one of the girls (i'll call her belle) got into a huge argument. apparently belle had a huge crush on joe, but he wasn't interested, and this exploded into most of the group getting involved because belle was being immature about it and decided to vent to everyone. when belle found out that i knew she got rejected, she then started to vent to me about stuff she didn't like about joe (he's a slob, he shows too much favoritism, etc, etc). why? i don't know. maybe to save face or to make me hate him? i really don't know. i was a freshman, and i didn't understand relationship drama of any kind. about a week after i found out about everything, belle called me and told me to stop flirting with joe. now, here's the thing: i hadn't been flirting with anyone. everyone in the group knew that i was not interested in dating, that i was a bit young to date (again, i was a freshman), and they all knew that my parents heavily monitored my internet use (again, i couldn't even show my face). no matter what i told her though, she wouldn't listen. from here, things get a bit.weird. at a scarily fast speed. i didn't tell joe about belle's interrogation, but everyone found out. the group basically banned all girls except me (the other girl took belle's side and went on a similar tirade), and the guys assured me that nothing would be different now that girls were banned. boy was that a lie. suddenly, instead of girls joining the group to game, random girls would join the skype calls for like two gaming sessions, leave, then be replaced for another two gaming sessions. i also realized that these girls never actually played with us; they kinda just flirted with the guys and encouraged them while they played. i started to get weirded out by this (cause, you know, this was not what i had agreed to join when i first started playing). i slowly started to pull away from the group, and joe, noticed. so he asked me if i wanted to have a ""cheerleader"" for myself (joe was the second person i told i was bi). i not-so-politely declined, as i thought it was extremely disgusting. i reminded him that i was a minor, and he said that he knew girls my age that would love me. i, again, declined. he asked me to turn my webcam on (""come on, your parents won't know if you turn your camera on and then just open up the gaming window), but i refused, as i was scared of what would happen if my parents ever found out. which pissed him off. he then said that he didn't want me to play, but would love for me to be his ""cheerleader,"" which would require me to use my webcam. i declined and basically cursed him out as best i could (again, my parents were kinda within earshot). the other guys each asked me at some point or another to be their ""cheerleader,"" and one guy found out we live in the same state and asked if i wanted to hook up with him (he was 17 at the time). i was so disgusted by all this, so i left. this experience wasn't the only reason i haven't joined another gaming group, but it is definitely a major factor. i was told later by the third girl that had left with belle years later that it was best i left, because belle came back, and she and joe have apparently blocked everyone that was in that group and began to date about a year after i left.yeah. sorry it was so long. edit: so i don't know much of the details about the girls and the how and why they were there. this was years ago and i was kept out of the loop because i was the only girl. the best reason i can give for them being there is that none of the guys really had any girlfriends (probably because of their attitudes and behavior) and having girls around to boost their egos and flirt made them feel better? i don't know. i just know it happened."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i had gotten to know this one guy off an online game i played for a short period of time. he seemed nice enough at first but would always ask me for personal information (real name, age, where i lived). i never gave him the info but used fake ones. about half a year goes by and he slips up, calling me my real name, which i had never given him. he tried to play it off that i had told him it a while ago, but i knew that wasnt true and started ghosting him after all while. about 1/2 a year later he contacts me ago, demanding to know where ive been. i told him i had been busy to which he replied didnt know a play took up so much time. this was when facebook was just starting up and i didnt have one. i didnt post about my personal life on line beyond a privately set livejournal which wasnt under my name, and even those were random. this freak on a leash was stalking me for whatever reason. i promptly told him i didnt want to hear from him again and kept an eye open for a good while for anyone acting shifty as well as tell my parents about it. i never really found out who he was, but my dad did catch some shady looking guy creeping around our house and scared him off (hes a fairly big guy and when hes mad he can intimidate people easily, but my dads really a big old softly). either way, its been probably some 13 years ago sense than and thankfully ive not heard from the guy since.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	not a horror story, but still. i was on a trip to ireland and my friend got sick and went back to canada. i decided that i would spend the rest of my trip with an online friend who lived in germany. we got along awesome through email and chat, she edited my stories for me and we talked about travelling. we knew each other for probably two years. anyway, i fly over to germany and stay at her place. she was really busy and we didnt really hang out, but that was okay! i hung out with her mom and did some exploring by myself including a day trip to cologne and went for a weekend trip to paris. on the morning i was leaving, we were having breakfast and its when i realized (after about a week), that things werent okay. the plan was for me to catch a train to frankfurt and then get on my plane (she wasnt able to drive me, but i told her no worries, i could handle getting there). she looks at me and says it seems like youre expecting me to drive you to the airport. im like no, im good with taking trains. tbh, i love trains! and she was really stand offish. when i leave, she waves goodbye, says it was nice meeting me, etc. fly back to canada, everything is great. then one day my mom calls me into the living room (i was 19 at the time). apparently my friend sent my mom a message on fb saying that i was basically a horrible guest and was rude and that she didnt think i was ready to actually travel and maybe i should grow up some more. my mom couldnt believe it and i actually started to cry. i had made sure to be the best darn canadian i could be. i constantly was polite, said please and thank you. it was my first time solo travelling so i was a bit weary, but i didnt think it was bad. that fucked me up good. i was so uncomfortable that i still (four years later) dont want to go to my friends houses for more than a day because im terrified theyll think im a bad guest. it took three years before i would even travel again, something i absolutely love.

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	i played everquest when it came out all day every day, still being in high school at the time. my gf at the time and i played regularly together and we had made some friends in the game that we adventured with all the time. one particular 'friend', who we had been adventuring with for nearly 4 years, had just got stationed in az and came up with a great idea for us all to move out there together. we were a couple years post high school and were ready for a real life adventure so we jumped on the chance. about 3 months in to living together, with things seemingly going just fine, i came across some event logs on my gfs computer with old net send msgs when investigating why her pc was crashing. these were old command line msgs you could send between networked computers that was built in to windows. they were discussing taking me white water rafting and pushing me off and how far from civilization we would be and that i would probably die in the water or trying to get home.

[SEP]	"i want to say this was in 1997. aol chat. became friends with a girl from the same city (las vegas). we spoke on the phone for hours over a couple calls and decided to meet. she never showed up. we talk on the phone after and she tells me exactly what i was wearing and also described the friend i was with perfectly. told me she was standing right next to me but didn't have the courage to say hello. buttered me up with ""you're really really hot and i want you really really bad and i panicked."" i decided hey, it happens lets try this again. i take a different friend with me this time and we went to a spot on the strip in vegas. my friend and i were standing outside a mcds on the sidewalk and kept hearing a girl in a car driving by yelling ""woo hooo!!"" which was a catchphrase of sorts for her and i immediately recognized it. my best friend started talking sense into me and telling me i was a putz if i stayed any longer. we left. i wrote her a long email when i got home and basically told her i really appreciated being made a fool of and that we should probably just stop talking. a few days later i started finding notes on my car after work from her. i did unfortunately tell her where i worked during one of our talks. after that, i started finding notes left on my car when i'd visit a particular friend. then it started happening at my house. as this was happening i called her and wrote her many times telling her to stop. of course she never responded. wherever i went those days i was constantly looking around, taking note of anyone who i might have seen anywhere before. fast-forward a week and i'm at my friends house where i had found notes on my car. we're playing basketball and a car pulls up with a single woman inside. she says she's this girls mother and that she won't be bothering me anymore. she also said that she can see why she was obsessed with me as she looked me up and down. she was maybe 50, quite large, had really bad caked on makeup and a slight smell of sulfur masked by a strong perfume. i'll never know **for sure** if this woman was indeed her mother or was the stalker herself. shit scares me now that i'm older. i was just an idiot 18 year old and just shrugged my shoulders after that and moved on. nothing else ever came of it, but with the amount of knowledge about my everyday life this person had, i've always wondered if they randomly stalked me after that."

[CLS]	what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	[SEP]	"this happened back in the dial-up bbs days in the early 90s. before netflix and chill, we had vhs and couch. the woman wasn't especially pretty, but was smart and rich (daughter of a doctor) and really liked me so i give it a go. our first date she wants to meet at her place and watch a movie. great, i figure i'm in like flynn! so i arrive at her address, and feel even luckier as it's a new neighborhood of mcmansions, years before that expression was even coined. walking inside, it's a semi open floor plan showcasing a professionally maintained *rainforest* in a 25x25 floor to ceiling glass on 4 sides area in the middle of everything, open to the sky and now perfectly lit at night. i make a good impression on her doctor dad with some smart banter, then we settle in for the movie. her girl game soon proved to be as awkward as her unkempt plain looks, as she started making over-the-top pdas with her dad sitting nearby, nose buried in some scholarly tome. i was trying to keep the escalation slow and discreet below couch level, and she kept putting both arms around me and leaning in too heavily, causing us to shift and move in the good doctor's periphery, even though he's apparently fine with it all. at one point, she gets on all fours, ass up and pointing in the general direction of her dad, and starts making out *with my ear.* mind you, we haven't actually kissed yet, but now she's breathing and slobbering loudly into my ear while her tongue explores it indiscriminately in a pattern like a norway rat trying to find the little platform in the dark experimental dunk tank. finally, she let out a low moan which was supposed to be sexy, but at that intimate distance of 0mm to my ear canal was more like a whale call fit to carry across countless nautical miles. then she plunged her tongue piston-like into my ear canal, simulating upon one eardrum a sudden dive to fathoms of depth and barometric pressure whales are accustomed to, causing me to jump up and yelp. i locked eyes with her very jewish father, while a long awkward moment passed while no explanation was asked or offered as to why the hitherto nice very blonde and white boy suddenly jumped up and shouted, ""**oye!**"" while in the process of making out with his daughter, whose ass is still up and pointing in his general direction. the moment passes; we get settled back into the movie, and at some point he bids us a friendly good night and pads silently into the dark catacombs of his suburban castle. next lull in the movie, i go in for a regular kiss, which she overeagerly reciprocates. she plunges her tongue into my mouth as deep as she can, then swishes it back and forth rhythmically, like a windshield wiper. i try to interact using my tongue, but hers just sweeps it aside like a bug, and continues the determined *swish-swosh-swish-swosh!* i break for air, then we kiss again, hoping it was a fluke. nope, she plunges the tongue straight in again, and starts sweeping back and forth mechanically. now we've gotten through the movie and she invites me to spend the night. she leads me to bed, strips down to a shirt and underwear, then says just a minute and goes into the bathroom across the hall. i'm lying there thinking it's weird but hey, easy pussy coming right up. a minute turns to ten, then twenty; during which my detective ears picked up the distinctive sounds of several sizes and hardnesses of pills rattling around different size bottles as they were upturned to disgorge their various rewards, and bouts of ugly crying. finally, she burst in, turned out the light, and climbed into bed with me and immediately started to try to make out. i paused the action and asked, are you okay? she said yes, but it was obvious she had been crying and might start again with every unsteady breath. she was obviously rapidly coming under the influence of whatever pills she popped, and the whole thing was now just a sea of red flags, so i pulled the ripcord and made apologies as i quickly dressed to go. she clung to me and pleaded, ""i don't want to lose you!"" as i thought, ""we just fucking met today!"" walked out of that palace of grave dysfunction, got in my inappropriately old and inexpensive car and drove out of the clutches of mcmansionville forever."

[SEP]	one of my first cases when i first started in the mental health field and i'll never forget. i was providing therapy to a young girl who was pooping on herself after holding it in for as long as she could. mom originally thought it was some kind of anxiety or fear of the toilet but after a couple more sessions i found out that the girl was being sexually abused by her step father and pooping felt like penetration to her so in order to avoid that sensation she would hold it in as long as possible. it was heartbreaking to find that out and a hell of an introduction to the field. edit: not sure if this is ok to do here but as a way to help people that don't have access to mental health services i started providing free mental health advice/ answering psychology related questions a few months ago through the form of social media and videos. if anyone is in need of assistance feel free to inbox me and i will provide you with my information. thank you!

[SEP]	i've been in a lot of group therapy as a patient. i know this isn't a direct answer to the question, but i feel the need to say it anyway. after all this therapy i learned to never assume anything about someone's family. never assume they have parents in the first place even. if they did have parents, never assume they are nice or deserving of respect. simple things like asking a stranger about mother's day or whatever could be really intrusive and a lot of people don't seem to understand the concept of cutting *family* (gasp!) out of your life. we did a value exercise and a lot of people chose family as a top value, which is okay, but i think it should be respect/love. if your family has that, then they will be in that rank, but family doesn't get a pass. i try not to probe about those things unless people want to talk about it.

[SEP]	i used to work in psychiatric case management. i helped people with mental illness find jobs, but i didn't often need to go deep in their clinical background. i happened to be coordinating with a therapist about one client, who was extremely socially anxious and could only work overnight shifts. it was frustrating because she had no real experience or skills, but was really picky about working with too many people & also wanted to make a certain amount so she didn't have to live with roommates. anyway, coordinating with the therapist required me to sort through some clinical files & review her case history. at 10 years old, her father had started brutally raping her. he died a few years later, at which point her older brother took over and started brutalizing her. this continued until she got pregnant in the 10th grade with her brother's child and had to drop out. she never learned to use a computer and could barely read. her mother, of course, allowed all this to happen until she also died a year or so later, leaving my client to raise her rape baby by herself. eventually she went to live with extended family, who were class acts in that they didn't sexually abuse her, but did absolutely zero to feed her, support her, or address her mental health needs, which were a definite issue at this point. her child was taken away before he turned 4. she never, in her entire life, had anyone who cared about her, much less taught her basic life skills or how to succeed in life. she had severe anxiety disorder and a personality disorder. needless to say i left work early that day. my frustration with her evaporated & i worked very hard for her in future visits. we take so much for granted.

[SEP]	not a mental health professional. when i was a teenager, i was in a residential treatment facility for a while for repeated suicide attempts and severe depression. there were a lot of really screwed up people there, but theres one in particular that really stands out. this girl was 15 years old and had multiple personalities. there was herself, there was one that was a version of her alcoholic mother, and one that was version of a herself as a toddler. when she was the alcoholic mom personality, shed punch things, hit people, be real nasty and mean. when she was the toddler personality, shed cry a lot, then lay down and arch her back as if offering herself sexually. the reason for this was because her mom used to sell her body when she was a toddler in exchange for drinks and drugs. she was conditioned to lay down and give herself up to men when she was barely old enough to form words. she also had some type of seizure disorder that was thought to be a result of her childhood trauma. it wasnt epilepsy or anything like that but a psychological response to feeling threatened. whenever shed get in an argument or get really sad, shed suddenly have a seizure. the seizures were 100% real. she had testing at the facility and she was hooked up to heart and brain monitors and everything. her brain activity during the texting proved the seizures were real. imagine having so much trauma that every time you felt intimidated or something youd seize as a defense mechanism. i think about this girl often and hope shes doing better. it was a small facility so all the patients were very close.

[SEP]	not a mental health professional, but my former sister-in-law has exhibited some things that even a psych 101 student would correctly diagnose. her childhood consisted of her drunken military father never being home and her drunken mom straight up abandoning the 3 kids to go cheat on her husband multiple times. they had an extremely nasty divorce. her older sister had to raise her when her dad wasn't home. she's always had low self esteem and quickly falls to using vices like weed, alcohol, and cigarettes to deal with her feelings. she got knocked up by my brother during a one night stand that turned into marriage and two kids. 5 years in a she can't take the stable life anymore (and my brother was working hard to have a stable life). she stopped coming home from work one random week and after a few weeks of being away, told my brother that she was leaving him. he wanted to work things out for the kids, but then it came out she was cheating on him so he said good riddance. she then tried to get back with him multiple times but only because she was broke. he said no every time without hesitation. they have joint custody of the kids, but she frequently shows disinterest in keeping them when it's not her time to keep them. during all of this, her older sister basically did the same thing. ran away from her family and cheated on her husband. their brother is stoner in his 30's who can't hold down a steady job. she started smoking cigarettes again to deal with all the stress in her life. the entire family is fucked up and it's pretty obvious that they emulated what they grew up with: unstable parents that ran around cheating and ignoring their kids. my fear is that my brother's kids will repeat the same mistakes when they are older.

[SEP]	hmmm. i'm hesitant to talk about this. i'm not a mental health professional, just my own life. not something i tell tend to talk to people about. when i was 7 me and my two brothers were watching t.v. on the couch in the game room, spongebob to be exact, around the time they had 11 minute episodes. we heard our mom screaming. we exit the game room into a big unused space by the stairs and hallway. we go past the intersection and take a left that leads to connection between the kitchen and living room. my mother was was on the ground in the living room, covering her face. our step father was at the otherside of the kitchen throwinh plates at her. from what i remember she was telling us to stay while our step father was telling us to go, but she'd tell you the other way around. we stood there watching before our older brother, 10 at the time (younger brother would of been about 4) got us to go back to the game room and once we were there i remember him telling us not to speak of what just happened again. what felt like just a few moments later out mom comes running in, literally covered in head to toe in blood, like a scene out of carrie. right behind her is out step father holding a butchers knife. he traps in a corner while our older brother gets us to hide behind the couch. we wanted us to keep our head down but i could help but watch. he threatened to kill her then all of us, but then he broke down and put the knife behind his head telling our mom to shove the knife in. the neighbors must of called the police because shortly after they came and he spent a night in jail, our mom didn't want to press charges but i really don't want anybody to blame her for that she was being abused and the little i know about her life growing up was too great either, she was a victim like all of us. after that the abuse became more obvious and happened in front us of more and now to us, and i could hear them at night keeping me up. i didn't know wether or not my family would die. i didn't really care about myself much, but i did care about them. my step dad is much bigger person than my then 7 year old self, didn't think there much i could do physically but with a knife i knew i could. so i spent what would become three years teaching myself how to move as silently as possible and hide a knife, waiting for the right opportunity. i didn't know if ge kill us all, so i thought the only option was to kill him. one day, when i was 10, i saw he hitting and yelling at my little brother. his back was too me and knew he wouldn't notice me. i always had a knife on me. i wanted to kill him so bad. i knew i could of. i just stood there, watching him beat my little brother and did nothing. for two more years he would be in our lives before our mom got us out of there. two more years i could of prevented. i don't know if the worst thing is contemplating killing him or not doing so. my family doesn't know about any of this. i only told a very few people i trust. my relationship with my family only got worst. i'm autistic and was never got diagnosed with ptsd till after i disconnected with my family. i have a really bad relationship with them because they never knew i had ptsd or really ever understood what being autistic was. i wish things could of turned out differently and i hope they are okay and happy. i do miss them and care for them, i also accept that they may not feel the same for me	[SEP]	31

[SEP]	time management **edit 1:** for few of those who want some tips about it. time management is basically prioritizing your work so that you can make most out of the fixed amount of time you have. here are few tips that i follow 1. every night create a list of work that needs to be done next day and order them in such a way that most important task are done first while maintaining a logical sequence of workflow. 2. at the end of the day check if you have done important things or not. 3. try to avoid procrastination, you have to do the work anyway. doing it in later point in time will only put you in stressful situation. 4. do some exercise or meditation, even simply walking can help a lot. 5. if you are unclear about what to do first today, just after waking up do the daily chores and take bath. it will really put you in a relaxed mood so you can think better. (it worked for me) 6. keep around 1 hour for yourself everyday to do things that you enjoy. after all we are humans not machines. **remember :** don't consider time as a resource which gets replenished after 24 hours, it is the only resource that you are dying for.

[SEP]	sewing. especially if you buy cheap clothes on the internet. just being able to re-attach buttons keeps you from throwing a shirt out when a few fall off. but i've even gone as far as to buy a sewing machine so i can tailor my own clothes to fit me, since slim fit shirts are hard to come by, and the ones i do find lack proper shoulder width. this has made owning clothing so much easier and less of a pain in the ass to try to buy.

[CLS]	what impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	[SEP]	having a limited ability to revert time. can only go back 12 hours at a time, and once the ability is used you need to wait at least the amount of time you re-wound before you can do it again (basically, you can't chain-leap backwards ad infinitum) you could essentially restart the same 12 hours over and over, but once you have let time progress more than 12 hours, that moment will be out of your reach forever. i think about how many times i would loop the same 12 hours before letting time progress, what i would use that extra time for, how i would perhaps slowly turn cold and distant from those around me; seeing them merely as atomatons; doomed to repeat the same mannerisms over and over, before i let time naturally run its course again. there are things that can be progressed in these repeated hours and things that cannot. i could read part of a book, for example, and then continue where i left off when i rewind again, but i wouldn't be able to continue playing a game or travel overseas etc. because any progress i make towards goals that take longer than 12 hours get wiped the instant i rewind. i would be a lonely observer of a day's many possibilities and potential outcomes, only to settle for one that's 'good enough' once the repetitiveness gets stale. would i turn into a sociopath? commit heinous acts because 'i can just rewind anyway?' i'm honestly not sure, i'd like to think not, but it seems like a very possible outcome. okay, maybe i can get a bit carried away sometimes.

[SEP]	i'm really enjoying drops, which is a visual vocabulary app for learning non-english* language. i can hold a conversation in (broken) french due to learning it when i was young, but i'm certainly not fluent and i've learned about 400 new terms/phrases in the past few months. when you learn a word it pronounces it for you as well as shows you a simple graphic representing what the word is, which i've found has really helped my absorption (though i recommend turning on the feature that lists its english translation after you solve each puzzle, because sometimes i would forget what exactly the word i learned meant because the graphic wasn't as specific as i needed it to be). you can play for 5 minutes every 10 hours, though if you maintain a streak you earn bonus time, and after every session there's an option to watch an ad to earn an extra minute. you can pay to get unlimited access but i actually really like having short sessions twice a day, because i'm definitely the type to want to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, and then burn out on it because i didn't pace myself. *edit: actually you can learn english, too!

[SEP]	camscanner. got a homework assignment or drawing you want to post or share? this app will take a picture then make it look like it was scanned, so lines can be darkened and everything easier too see and read. it really beats the hell out of bad lighting and blurryness. all without a scanner. edit: wow whyd this blow up? i thought it was underrated but obviously enough people use phone scanners. someone recommended this to me to scan art sketches that save to my camera roll then to my drive. i like that camscanner heightens the contrast for me. cool of yall to add your two cents but please dont attack me for not using the program that works for you. also no i dont use its premium.

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	google trips is amazing. my first solo trip was to thailand and i didn't know how to plan a trip and it wasn't great. my second solo trip to japan was amazing because of this app. firstly, any relevant emails that you recieved through gmail get added, so all of your hotel and flight reservation info are in one place. it also saves them in google maps for you so you don't need to remember to pin them. phone numbers and addresses too, so you can show a taxi driver. most places have detailed transportation info: from how to get into the city from the airport, to miniscule rules for public transit, like if they only exit from the back doors of the bus so you don't look like an ass. they mine maps for tons of restaurant reviews. i like that you can choose what's really close, or cheap eats (great for breakfast) or when you don't want a lot of fuss). it can create customized day plans for you, or adjust to what's near by you at the moment. there's tons of other cool little features too. and you can download most of the info in case you don't have data. i can't recommend this enough!

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	virtual hope box. mental health app. it's designed specifically for ptsd, but honestly it's great for any variety of anxiety or depression. it's also completely free without ads. long ass description incoming. tl;dr if you have mental illness, download this app, it's super awesome. it has four main sections. distract me has simple puzzle games to refocus your mind. no pressure from time limits or score keeping, and most games give you an easy way to get hints if you get frustrated. inspire me has a database of inspirational quotes; it shows one at random and you can swipe for a new one. you can mark favorites to give them priority in the randomization, you can remove quotes that rub you the wrong way, and you can add quotes if you know one that isn't in the app. you can also choose to have daily notifications with a random quote, at the time of your choice. relax me is guided exercises. the deep breathing one is my personal favorite. this one is customizable in every way. you can set all the lengths so that the exercise is tailored to your breathing capacity, and edit the background images/music. you can also choose whether to have prompts, visual and/or audio. also in relax me, there's muscle relaxation and several guided meditations. the fourth category is coping tools. you can make coping cards specific to your needs. like for example, you can create a low self esteem card that has a list of things you do well and positive traits you have. so when you're feeling worthless, go look at your card, and you'll see exactly why you aren't. it can be hard to make cards by yourself, but a therapist or supportive loved one can help. the other part of coping tools is a calendar for social engagements, like lunch dates. there's a fifth kind-of category called remind me. it lets you upload photos and sound files. you can use these to customize the other parts of the app, or you can just look through your library.

[SEP]	for those of you that need to talk to someone but dont know who to talk to or how, i recommend replika, its a personalize self-learning chatbot that will try its best to either cheer you up or at least keep you company during darker times. the developers dont keep track of whats its learned unless you submit something to them (like if it sounds like its going crazy and there might be a problem with the code). all of your information is stored clientside. it has easy access to the suicide hotline and other help hotlines. i use it myself, its really been helping me.

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	a few apps that are helpful for anyone, but are very useful for dealing with the daily struggles of my mental health problems: **[daylio](https://daylio.webflow.io/)** (android & ios) - quick daily mood journal. you select how your mood was that day, and then you can check off items/activities that you did (you can include customized ones). gives nice statistics, takes less than a minute to fill out, and lets me analyze patterns in my mood - was my mood better or worse on days i was drinking? days i saw my friends? days i took a nap? etc. **[habit tracker/habitbull](http://www.habitbull.com/)** (android & ios) - a habit tracker/reminder app that isn't gamified like habitica. reminders for daily tasks, weekly, or even customizable for something you do every other tuesday at 9am. gives nice statistics on streaks and % of days you successfully complete the tasks. mostly helps because i need something to nag me into brushing my teeth every night and scooping the litter box more regularly. **[sleep as android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/)** (android only) - very useful alarm. i use mine to let me snooze only once for 10 minutes and then must scan a barcode taped to my fridge in order to shut the alarm off. forces me up and out of bed, and encourages me to take my vitamins & medication, and start breakfast instead of falling back to sleep. customizable tasks for shutting off the alarm if you don't want to scan a barcode - that one just works for me. **app i just enjoy:** **[old school runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/mobile)** (android & ios) - because i'm a nerd that loves runescape, and now i can play it on my phone or tablet :)	[SEP]	92
[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	myfitnesspal. the annoying truth is the best way to lose weight is count your calories and treat it like a budget each day. myfitness pal makes it easy to log whatever you eat, and it has almost every kind of food you can imagine, fast foods, everything in the grocery store, even really random stuff comes up to my surprise (like ramen package from japan). you an even scan the bar code of a package to add it. it only takes a few minutes a day to enter stuff and it helps you figure out what to eat to stay at a calorie deficit.	[SEP]	4615

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	duolingo, i know that everyone jokes about the owl but really, every time i open the app up i'm astonished. it keeps education free, it pays homage to languages that might have died without their help, it has high valyrian, a fictional language. all of it is for the price of a few ads, they aren't even video adds, they're just pictures that you can quickly click out of. the lessons are easy too, the hearts thing is a bit annoying but it really is worth it and they make words easy to pick up.

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	tiny tower and soul knight. tiny tower is a really old idle game (like, from before idle games became a thing). the devs still support it and there's no pop-up ads unless you tap on a specific button in the menu to watch an ad. it's way different from other idle tower games. been playing for years. and soul knight is just a really fun undertale-style dungeon game with auto-aim and hours of gameplay and again, no ads.	[SEP]	65
[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	google maps. i am talking specifically about the option to download offline maps for almost any city in the world. they really help when you are in a foreign city and you try to find some place, as offline maps will show you where you are at currently and where the location is you are looking for, without the need to use data. edit for clarification: google maps is not an underrated app, that is true. i do believe though that the offline map feature of google maps is an underrated and useful part of that app.	[SEP]	2742
[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	toogoodtogo. put simply it's an app to collect leftover food from restaurants at a large discount (70-80%). i live in europe and many restaurants and bakeries have leftovers that would go to waste. the first time i used it i bought a family size pizza for 3 euros. to my surprise it was reasonably fresh and tasty.

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	profiler - gives a bunch of useful system information (cpu/gpu usage, clocks, temps etc.) and has a really good overlay so you can see how much resources apps use in real-time. google authenticator - 2fa code app, used by reddit. for real, use it. blokada - the single best ad blocker for non-rooted devices. it acts as a vpn to block hosts without root access. if you're rooted, use adaway since it modifies the hosts file directly. obviously both aren't available on the play store. naptime - an alternative to greenify, created by francisco franco (developer of francokernel). works better than greenify in my experience. accubattery - gives a lot of stats on your battery. my favorite is the estimated real capacity of the battery. sd maid - super simple space cleaner, can scan the whole device and sort stuff by size (kinda like windirstat on pc). movie mate/series mate - my favorite clients for trakt, which tracks the movies and shows you've watched. fasthub - really good github client. teamviewer - yes, it's on android and you can access your pc remotely with your phone.

[SEP]	torque pro. it can tell you everything your car is doing in real time. it's even more useful if your car has an aftermarket nav unit that can download apps. &#x200b; my car has a bluetooth obdii reader that is connected to my nav unit through bluetooth. if my check engine light comes on i can pull the codes right there on my nav unit. &#x200b; i can also add digital gauges to the display so i can watch my 0-60 time, rpm, how much torque my car is putting out, oil pressure, boost and a shit ton of other stuff. &#x200b; i highly recommend that app as well as a bluetooth obdii reader.

[SEP]	"if you have an iphone, there's an app on it called ""measure"", which uses your camera and you can select two points and measure the distance between the two, pretty nifty. &#x200b; edit: since people are asking, it is very particular, like if you try to measure something from a distance, it most likely won't be extremely accurate. to get an accurate measurement, i've found you have to drag your phone along the length of what you're trying to measure rather than simply pointing your camera from point a to point b. so it has its limitations but if you do the first method i find it works rather well, but yeah disclaimer."

[CLS]	reddit, what are some underrated apps?	[SEP]	"annoyed phone guy here. seeing some bad advice. not sure if ignorance or malice. i'm not gonna call anyone out, though. first big problem i see. subscription apps. this is a big problem on ios, but it's coming to android, too. so what happens is, you have an app that should be free or a one-time payment, but it's a monthly subscription. as in, you will pay that amount every single month as long as you have the app. a lot of weather apps are doing it, even ones that charge you up front. they get the data from public sources, too. these predatory apps are a dime a dozen and they really only exist to rip off stupid people. obviously some subscriptions are justified, like netflix, hulu, spotify, things that are providing constantly updated content. but a weather app, or a shopping list. you don't need to keep paying for that. free is good, paid is fine, subscription is a scam. i have an iphone, and i'll post the best underrated apps i have that i use. with both android and ios, there are usually a bunch of apps competing for the same spot on your phone. the difference between a phone guy and a casual user is one who looked at all the options and found the best (not always the same answer, since we're all different) and the other who just got the first thing they found and made it work, for better or worse. most of these are free, and most are on both major mobile platforms. i'll let you know if they're not. ourgroceries: shopping list. been using it for almost 10 years now. it's on ios, it's on android, and it's on the web. totally free to use, but it has a banner ad. $5 to get rid of it. worth paying on android. if you have an iphone, you should know the developer doesn't care about apple at all. we don't get any of the good features. it's pretty bare-bones. still worth paying if you want that extra quarter inch, but absolutely not necessary. ishows tv: tracks tv shows through trakt.tv. this is ios only. trakt.tv is a website you can use on your desktop (or mobile) browser. on android, seriesguide is the way to go, and it's free. ishows costs $2 or $3. basically, you add the shows you watch, and as you watch them, you mark them as seen and you can rate them out of 10 (five stars but you can do half stars). if the show is ongoing, it will show how many days until the next episode, but if you're behind, it'll show how many aired episodes you haven't seen yet. for anyone who watches a lot of shows, this is good stuff. bing: laugh it up. it's not google. on mobile, it's better. i've checked it out on android, too, and it's just as legit there. microsoft threw everything but the kitchen sink at their app. private searching is front and center if you want to be anonymous. it has maps, weather, news, all kinds of stuff. and the best part of all? while the google app will quite literally tunnel around your ad blocker, if you have one, to get ads onto your phone, bing. includes. an ad. blocker. yes, it has adblock plus built right in. abp is the controversial one with ""acceptable ads"" which means ad providers can pay to bypass it, but this feature can be disabled to make abp a decent ad blocker. look, if you need help with games, ever, you know wikia is a festering shithole of ads. bing your game stuff, you'll see the difference it makes. abp has to be turned on first, though, as it's off by default, though once it sees so many ads, it will tell you about it. google keep: a few people mentioned this already, but it's worth repeating. best notes app ever. once you do categories and sharing, it gets so much better. apollo: best reddit client on ios, and it's not even close. when i used android, i used sync and baconreader. bacon's on ios, too, but it's a different app made by a different team at the same company. there are a ton of reddit clients for both platforms, and most of them are made by redditors who want to make reddit better, so. most of them are somebody's favorite. i just try different reddit clients and find things that they don't do that apollo does. apollo matches my flow. maybe you use reddit differently. in any case, it's worth trying different ones, and it's worth paying for a few different ones. i prefer apollo, but i want to see others thrive, too, because that encourages everyone to do their best. google photos: i saw this mentioned once as ""free backup."" it's more than that. all photos 16mp or less will be backed up for free. above 16mp, you get to make a choice. downsample to 16mp or use your google drive storage (15gb free, with paid plans for more). no iphone has had more than 12mp to date. some android phones have gone over 16, though. my wife's last phone was 20 or 24, i forget which. 16mp is fine, though, and if your camera is less. i always hear about people who lost precious photos. this doesn't have to be a problem. and it's a solution that is free to solve. and there's much more to google photos. scanner mini: someone mentioned camscanner, which has issues, and they were brought to the poster's attention, i suppose, given their edit. the truth is, you shouldn't pay for scanning. google, microsoft, and apple all do it for free. google's is photo scanner. microsoft's is office lens. and apple's is built into notes. i use readdle's scanner mini. it works with documents, their file manager. there is a pro version but i don't need it. documents: almost forgot this because it's on my dock and i'm going by homepage. documents is an ios file manager and cloud manager that plays media and reads documents. it also lets me turn my phone into a wifi drive and share everything with anyone on the same wifi network. i have yet to meet a good android file manager that does that. let me be clear, if we're on the same network, i can take your android phone, open chrome, browse to an address (docsfiletransfer dot com), this will give you a barcode, my iphone scans it, and now your android phone is browsing my iphone, and you can download any file i have on it. if you have an iphone, it's easier, my documents will detect your documents and they auto pair and i can send the file right on over. for android, solid is the file manager of choice. but it doesn't do the wifi drive. there are apps out there that do, but since i don't use android as my personal phone, i haven't really looked into it. movies anywhere: more of a service, but it's also an app. it's disney's movie streaming service, but it has a poorly kept secret. if you connect another streaming service to it, like itunes, it will give you free itunes copies of everything in ma and free ma copies of everything in itunes. well, limited to certain studios, and movies only, not tv, music, books, anime, any of that stuff. there are like 7 services it supports, and if you connect more than a couple, they even give you free movies, and they go to all services. i'll tell you two reasons why this is awesome. one, if one service goes under, your movies still exist on all the rest. two, itunes has good sales and whatever, but you can only really watch its movies on apple devices. if you switched from iphone to android, apple sort of holds those movies hostage. connect ma and google, and now you can watch itunes movies on youtube. yeah. that's huge. youtube is on everything. so is vudu, but youtube is probably something you use more. waze: social maps. shows things like speed traps, and debris on the road. contingent upon people actually reporting these things, and you can report them yourself. pretty nice map app, too, though google maps reigns supreme here. (google owns waze.) chrome remote desktop/anydesk: you know what's cool? running windows on your phone. you can't actually run windows 10 on an iphone, or an android phone for that matter, but if you have chrome remote desktop on your computer, you can access it right from your phone, whether you're in the same room or on the other side of the planet. the possibilities are endless. anydesk has more options, but isn't quite as smooth. but anydesk lets you control an android phone from the computer or an iphone, as long as the app is running (but not the other way around, ios is the only platform that cannot host). so yeah, android on an iphone. this isn't for practical use, it's for helping someone. so if you were having problems with your android phone, you could give me your desk number, and i could take over your phone, over the internet, from my iphone, and use it like i was holding it. there is some input lag, and if you didn't like what i was doing, you could kick me off. good for people with older parents. chrome remote desktop can only host on pc. i prefer crd for taking control of my pc with my phone, but anydesk has uses as well. google opinion rewards: mentioned before, but they didn't mention it's for ios, too. and the ios version pays out, every $2 earned, to paypal. that's because paypal can be used for app store/itunes purchases, but, unlike android users, ios users can cash out their opinion rewards money. also, being an iphone user means your opinion is worth more. that's not my opinion. that's google, giving me fewer surveys than my wife when we both had android (women get more surveys) and now me getting more surveys with an iphone. if *she* got an iphone, her surveys would go way up. opener: this is ios only, because it addresses a problem that android never had. so on android, if you have two or more of the same app, android will ask you which app you want to use. makes sense, right? apparently, apple never figured out how to do that. and it's a damn shame. some apps can choose the app they want to call, but there's no system-wide setting. so something that would open in the app you don't want it to, share it to opener, and opener will do what android does, offer you the choice and let you set it. android expats using ios will enjoy this greatly. edit: broke reddit's limit! one more in the replies."

(we could be suspended or expelled.) and that we should do it on an important day. luckily, important guests visited our school often and the next visit was the following week. it happened to be the founder of the school. we read through the rule book for any loopholes we could've exploited. that's when i noticed that the student handbook that the wardens, teacher's, treated like a bible for ""uniform etiquette,"" said nothing of where a student was to wear their ties. (our uniforms consisted of a blouse, a navy blue skirt and a tie along with the school badge and whatever pins that aligned itself with school activities, such as house badges, student council badges etc.) the girl decided we would use this rule to ""host a revolution that wouldn't stop until, at least, some of the 'unreasonable' restrictions were lifted."" so on school's founder's visiting day, at least 90% of the student body started wearing their ties in ridiculous places. like some tied it around their waist, some tied them around their heads, some tied it around their arm, some of them used them as hair ties, the list goes on. needless to say, it made the teachers furious and embarrassed, however, the founder found the entire situation ""very funny, appreciated our respect for the school"" and praised us for our ""united front."" the ""red and gold rebellion"" was successful in more ways than one. (the ties were red, gold and black.) not only did we get our restrictions lifted, but we also became closer to the founder and was given access speak to him if more trouble arose, the teachers grew to appreciate the many more aspects of life and the entire student body became more like a family. anyway, after that, they refined their student handbook and specified where to wear your ties and more. they really disallowed rebellion through uniform loopholes after that, which i found hilarious. tl;dr: student body had enough with the heavy rules and restrictions, used a loophole through uniforms rules to revolt and got any uniform loophole exploitation banned."

[CLS]	what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	[SEP]	my friends and i played this game where, if one of us was taking a dump, we had to text our group as soon as we'd left class. everyone else in the group would then ask to 'go to the bathroom' (or just walk out of the class), but would be leaving class to search the entire school for the pooper's poop place. we kept score (of course). if you could finished pooping in time, or if you were the first to find and send a photo of the pooper mid-poop you were awarded points. the teachers started getting suspicious when everyone all of a sudden had to shit at the same time and/or they'd see like 10 guys running around frantically searching every bathroom on campus. simultaneously, the game was growing in both popularity and notoriety, and eventually someone spilt the beans under pressure. punishment? no one in the senior class could use the bathroom. like 20 of us got the got the bathroom banned, for \~300 people. did it last long? no, of course not, because it was a stupid fucking response made by some strangely draconian teachers/admins. everyone's parents immediately complained. some of the teachers were livid and tried to make more of a fuss (others thought it was hilarious), but the school dropped the bathroom ban because you can't ban that. however, we were warned if we got caught playing we'd be suspended. so, ya, we got trying to catch each other taking shits during class banned. 10/10 would recommend, was super fun.

[CLS]	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	[SEP]	"not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the us in the depression. it was called the civilian conservation corps. participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country. the reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the dust bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the us was not a bottomless well of natural resources. (erosion was a big cause of the dust bowl, and the dust bowl was a factor in the depression, so it all tied together.) they were also called ""roosevelt's tree army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control. in my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture. you can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive. (i'm actually going to stay in one next week.) some of them have photos from the ccc days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on. i'd definitely support a program like that today, but i think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it. plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated. with the ccc, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out. it would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start. edit: a number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins i mentioned. the ones i'm familiar with are in pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/. not all cabins are ccc-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details. (there's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about ccc's role in the park.) rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a pennsylvania resident. the system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly. some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ada-accessible unit. other states and some national parks also have ccc-built cabins available for rental, but as far as i know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are."

[SEP]	no, because i don't think transporting millions of young people out of cities, towns and rural areas to these destinations and forcing them to work will be helpful. i get that they need to be made conscious of environmental issues, but i just don't think it would be effective (as in actually helping to get the work done). they could only do work that they wouldn't need a qualification or any special skills for, it would be a massive safety issue (making sure they don't drown cleaning the ocean or get injured planting trees) and it would cost massive amounts of money to pay, house and feed them all. i generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. it would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects.

[CLS]	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	[SEP]	not mandatory. i have a baby on the way and would not be chill at all with the government forcing me to be seperated from him. also i dont think it would foster a very productive work environment for those involved. most people would be mad to be forced and so would have poor work ethic and it would actually make people care about and want to help the environment less. then theres the question of if it would be paid. if its not, you have people losing homes, credit getting ruined, and whole livelyhoods being destroyed. if it is paid, you still have the problem of how some of those people would pay their bills. for most that would be fairly simple (assuming theyre always able to access the internet, which is unlikely), but some people have bills that are still accepting payment in the stone age, as in they expect them to mail or hand deliver the payment (for example: discount motors near where i live). and frankly, im completely against the government making any action mandatory.

[CLS]	would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	[SEP]	i wouldn't - simply because environmental issues can't be fixed by individuals, but rather by corporations. the work that individuals do would do nothing to combat the thousands of acres of private land where trees are cut daily or the insane amount of emissions that factories give out. and it would also create a sense of entitlement among the richest who control the corporations : 'we spent x amount of time fixing the earth's environment, so we now have a free chit to do whatever we want with it'	[SEP]	5

[SEP]	mandatory is something that i do not abide with. instead i would suggest incentive. much like requiring a licence and insurance to operate a vehicle on public roads. you dont have to acquire these but if you want to drive than it is your prerogative. what i would suggest is programs that for example substitute/waive tuition fees for your time and efforts. if it is your prerogative to receive an education than this is something to consider. the army does exactly this with their programs, you give your time and effort, they educate you, you apply these skills and knowledge to the army for a while and then to yourself. its mutually beneficial. everybody wins.

[SEP]	had a friend become impatient with mushrooms once. he took an eighth, and an hour later decided they werent very strong, so the most logical thing to do would be eat his other eighth. cut to 2 hours later, and he is parked on top of a parking garage. tried to drive across town when they kicked in and he immediately realized his fuck up. he tried to wait it out, but after being abandoned by everyone else (i wasnt around, no way in hell would i have left the poor guy on 7 grams of shrooms to his own devices) and he decides he needs help. so he calls 911. while on the phone he wants to be as honest as possible, so he tells them about his .22 caliber rifle behind the seat of his truck. only it comes out as,theres a gun in the car. he says he was tripping and sweating so badly (it was july) the next thing he remembers is hearing a *tink tink tink* and looking up to being surrounded by police, guns drawn and ready for anything. friend isnt a danger though, so they get him in an ambulance, and give him charcoal to induce vomiting. the rest of the night is a blur for him, and he wakes up cuffed to the bed. they ask him if theres anyone he can call for a ride, and he tells them his mom is a nurse who works on the second floor. apparently while tripping he kept telling them to go upstairs and get mom, so they all have a chuckle realizing his mom really was upstairs.

[thievery corporation.](https://youtu.be/un9tulbhr8y) so i reached down and hit the remote without him noticing. a few seconds go by and he turns to me with the widest eyes i've ever seen. ""whoa. what. is. this. music?"" he was in true bliss. he kept asking me about the music for the rest of the ride. we dropped him off and i wrote ""listen to thievery corporation"" on a sheet of paper and tucked it into the waistband of his boxers. i like to think there's some dude out there from upstate new york who fell in love with thievery in high school but doesn't really know why. edit: yeah!! thanks guys for my first gold/silver after being on here for years. it's also my birthday and you guys just made a ho-hum day great! this happened 13 years ago and i've had many great experiences in my career, but this is still one of my favorite ems stories. i'm happy you all enjoyed it. for those of you new to thievery, glad you found them! also check out cosmic game, radio retaliation and culture of fear. they span so many genres but always bring a great vibe. and their message is pretty on point. one of the few bands i almost never skip."

[CLS]	in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	[SEP]	er physician here. i see complications of drug abuse daily. that said, er visits from hallucinogens are very rare. not counting some bad reactions to pcp and ketamine, which are more dissociative agents than hallucinogens, i have probably only seen a handful of cases in my entire career. i wish i could say the same for alcohol, which contributes to multiple injuries every shift i work. most of the time it is pretty boring. usually the patient was either naive to the drug or took a bit too much and has some anxiety. a few cases of teenagers being caught tripping by their parents and dragged to the hospital, which seems like a terrible experience. now, what i am seeing is an increase in senior citizens having bad reactions to marijuana edibles. basically someone in their retirement community gets a medical marijuana card, and they all decide to try edibles for the first time, only to find out this isnt the weed they were smoking in the 60s. not really a hallucinogen, but one time i was using propofol to sedate a patient for a procedure. he thought he was lionel from thindercats, and was doing the thunder. thunder. thundercats. ho! thing the whole time. it was hysterical. outside of work, one of my friends ate a bag of shrooms at a party, and got stuck in a loop talking about the camel from the cigarette brand. he was convinced the camel was coming to the party. another friend tried to go surfing one night while on shrooms. issue was he forgot to put clothes on. yep, guy was walking down the road at 2am, butt naked, with nothing but a surfboard. so while i cannot give my endorsement for drugs. hallucinogens (assuming untainted product, in reasonable doses, in a safe setting) tend to be fairly safe compared to other drugs of abuse that i see regularly. now i am sure people have done dumb/dangerous shit while on them, but it seems low compared to other substances some of which are legal. edit - i apologize everyone. i get it - his name is lion-o. i guess i am a little out of date on my thundercats trivia.

[SEP]	physician here. i have not seen anyone on mushrooms (at least not that i knew of) in the hospital. the drug testing for them is actually relatively difficult and not standardized (or at least it wasn't when i was training). i have seen people whacked out of their minds on pcp. we had a patient strapped down to a bed in four point restraints. this was actually pretty common with some of the violently psychotic patients in philadelphia where i trained. i watched the guy somehow shake the bed to the point where he was able to stand up and waddled forward still attached to the bed in his restraints. as a medical student at the time, i just go out of there and let the professionals work that case. patients on pcp will shatter glass, break bones, etc and feel nothing until they come down. i have also seen a patient with lesch-nyhan syndrome. these patients will disturb you. lesch-nyhan is an enzyme disorder which culminates in extreme neurologic symptoms. these patients are classically known to self-mutilate, gouge their own eyes out, etc. the patient i briefly came into contact with would attempt to bite anyone the moment they walked by or got too close. it was super disturbing because it was completely without malice. this patient was also in four point restraints.

[CLS]	in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	[SEP]	okay, so not a doctor and not exactly a great story but stay far, far away from k2/spice/any other kind of synthetic ~~marijuana~~ cannabinoids. i work in the mental health field and nearly all of the staff here agree that they have never seen worse episodes of psychosis than some of the ones they've seen after people take k2 (and these are people who've seen it all: opioids, cocaine, crack, pcp, you name it). stuff like violently throwing their entire body into a wall over and over and over. one person woke up in a psych hospital and couldn't remember anything that happened after smoking k2. they told her she'd stripped naked and was pouring milk on herself in the middle of a very busy street and she was absolutely horrified, mostly because she couldn't remember any of it. people legit trying to eat themselves. seizures and cardiac arrest. the kind of stuff that i would call absurd and unrealistic if it was in a movie. there are hundreds and hundreds of different chemical compounds they can use to make that stuff and they are constantly changing it to avoid it being detectable in drug tests or to skirt laws. because it's not regulated, you literally have no way of knowing what you're actually smoking when you get that shit, but you can almost be guaranteed that whatever it is will fuck up your brain and not in a good way. edit: this post started getting up higher than i thought it would, so i want to add some good information people left in the comments below. u/probablyboobs: adding to that; it's not called synthetic cannabinoid because it has any structural similarities to cannabis (which is not dangerous), but because it interacts with the body's endogen cannabinoid system. in whatever way. that's literally the only similarity, it can affect your body in many different ways and it is dangerous. not comparable with marihuana. u/pounce-a-lot: not only is the psychosis severe, but long lasting. i saw clients who were very young with no psychiatric history, and now they have psychosis that isnt responding to medication because of heavy spice usage. its a terrible drug. \[and i just want to add that the people i work with have also told me the exact same thing.\]	[SEP]	676

[SEP]	"actual doctor here! busy overnight shift in er, 16 year old brought in with police custody. like 3 dudes, in vests and heavily armed. kids eyes were huge and his body was covered in scratches. apparently, he and his girlfriend did lsd for the first time, took of all of his clothes and jumped a balcony, ran through a forest, and she called the police. police reportedly took the better part of an hour corralling this naked 16 year old running through the forest, accumulating scratches from branches. the mental image killed me. the high had worn off for the kid at this point. discharged on arrival, essentially. my only medical advice was, ""next time, find a babysitter."" but yeah, i live/work in some of the worst heroin-trafficking parts of the country. people can get real crazy."

[SEP]	im an anesthetist. during a c-section the epidural seemed to not fully be working and the patient was feeling pain so we were forced to give ketamine. ketamine has many effects and one of which is profound pain blocking (analgesia). its safe to use in this case because it wont stop the baby from breathing like morphine or fentanyl would. ketamine also causes hallucinations.like severe hallucinations. patient stopped screaming from pain and began screaming from the dragons! ooooooohhhh shit! oh shit! ahhh, get them away while being totally pain free and comfortable. it was not in a terrified way but more of an excited i cant believe it kind of way. when the baby came out and began crying it turned to what in the fuck is that! oh my god! that lasted a solid 20 mins. edit: thanks for the gold! first gold coin ever.

[SEP]	not a mushroom story, but had taken a couple hits of acid early in the evening and went to watch a movie with some friends. they ended up driving and had to head another way, so i told them i'd just hop a bus home.was waiting for the bus, and while i was fully tripping yet, it was definitely making things burn a little brighter. the bus stop is at one end of the transitway and it was about 20-30 minute wait for the bus at the point in the night. eventually i convinced myself i was trapped at the bus stop like neo in the matrix revolutions was at the subway station. after an excruciating 30 minutes (which felt infinitely longer) the bus comes, and go home to ride out the rest of the trip watching something on my tablet. so i loaded up a whole playlist of fullmetal alchemist since i was watching it for the first time (for anyone that has seen it, it was the episode where alphonse faced off against pride). i don't know how it happened, but at the beginning of one episode it recapped the past episode, so i thought i had already seen it. so i skipped to the next one, saw the recap and had no clue what happened, so i go back to the previous episode. **i did this for an hour.** eventually i gave up and put on batman: the animated series while the wallpaper melted. always found the trick with hallucinogens was to just go with the flow since it was all in my head. until i some how fucked up a sequential play list when all i had to do was keep watching. i also went to a deserted coffee shop at 4 am and waited 20 minutes for service, before leaving $10 by the cash and walking out with a tin of coffee grounds.

[SEP]	i had a trauma patient who went to brunch, got drunk, and met a new friend who offered him some mushrooms. all his other friends advised against it and went home, but he was adamant. fast forward, and new friend is nowhere to be found and my patient had fallen off a roof and was on the way to me in an ambulance. he rolls through the doors with 15 police officers, so i ask hey, is he violent? whats up? and they said no, but we just want to see what hes going to do next. and they all laughed. he was apparently jumping from house to houses roofs and someone called 911. he refused to get down and get yelling brian and created a whole police response including the helicopter. he eventually fell between houses, (no more than a 2-story fall) landed on cactus and a recycling bin and then ran into the front yard and was apprehended by police while doing snow angels. he was definitely tripping balls when he arrived, but was directable and pretty chill. fairly uninjured too, spent a long time plucking cactus spines out of his whole body so asked him about his experience. how did he get on the roof? he climbed a telephone pole he thought was a beanstalk in mario. who was brian? apparently his brother he was looking for. why did he keep running? he thought the helicopter was an alien spaceship light beam that was after him. right before he went to his admission bed for the night he got a goofy grin on his face so i asked what was up. he said is it wrong i want to do it again? and i said yes, since he had caused a lot of expensive chaos. but if there was a next time, dont be drunk and have close friends with you. tldr; guy brunches too hard, meets a new friend who gives him mushrooms for the first time, then loses this new friend and gets transported into a mario game while searching for his brother and causes a full police helicopter response, falls off a roof and ends up in the hospital as a trauma patient with a $50k bill.

[SEP]	"i used to work in ""psychedelic harm reduction"" at a pretty big, and majorly wild music festival where i live and i have some absolutely bonkers stories. my favorite though is the time i met lars. lars was somewhere in his late 30s, tall, ruggedly handsome with one of those faces that just exudes character. he was dressed like an old-timey prospector and carried a huge, hand-made leather rucksack. lars had hiked in to the festival without purchasing a ticket. he walked 10 hours through uncut woods, hiked over a mountain and then swam across a river just to get there. lars had never taken psychedelics before the night i met him, so of course he thought it would be a good idea to take 4 hits of lsd. security escorted lars into the space (a large, secluded area near the center of the festival full of hammocks, tents, art supplies, snacks and a committed staff of wonderful, caring people), and from the moment he saw me, he was imprinted on me like a baby duckling. he literally didn't leave my side for the next 8 hours as i talked him off the psychedelic precipice. at one point i had to literally go into a porta-potty with him, as the thought of being without me for even one minute was too much for his fragile psyche to bear. lars was, and still is, one of the most interesting people i'd ever met. we talked a lot, and while he mostly went in circles, they were ever expanding concentric circles, and so in time i learned a little bit more about him with each cycle. he had this little hand gesture kind of like little tiny karate-chops he'd do every so often to accentuate a point, accompanied by this kind of ""tch tch tch"" sound. he was very intense, but mostly just wanted someone to see him and hear him. he really needed me to understand where he was coming from, and i was only too happy to oblige him. lars grew up in sweden, and came from a broken home. he was for a time the swedish national youth archery champion. he was also a member of sweden's version of the navy seals, though was very cagey about his time in the service. he left sweden after the death of his mother (this part was unclear, but she was possible murdered by his father) and eventually made his way to canada. in canada he lived the life of a true man of the wilds. he had an old dodge pickup he'd made a custom camper for, and he traveled around the back country, hunting and living off the land. he made literally everything he needed for his life himself. he made bows, he made clothes, he made shoes, he made pots and pans. if lars needed something, there wasn't a damn way in hell he was going to a store to buy it when he could damn well make it himself. he also had a donkey that he sometimes traveled with that seemed to be his one true friend in the world. i found out later that lars is also one of the most amazing landscape photographers i've ever seen. i won't share a link to his work as i don't want to out his real identity, but trust me, the dude's work is fucking spectacular. the way he uses color, and the scenery he finds in his wild-man travels are truly stunning. printed large format, his photographs could easily grace the walls of any high-end gallery, though of course lars thinks selling art for money is unseemly. lars and i spent near 8 hours together, him becoming a little more lucid with each passing hour. he eventually decided he was ready to take a nap in one of the hammocks and after exchanging contact details he thanked me for ""saving his life"" (i did no such thing) and fell into the blissful sleep of a man who'd done battle with his demons and come out the other side mostly intact. i saw lars in the real world a few years after our night together. we'd stayed in touch and eventually he was in the city where i live and we met for a walk. he was just as interesting as i remember, and wanted me to buy this abandoned old hotel he'd found in some small town in the middle of nowhere so he could turn it into an art gallery or something. if i'd had the money i probably would have done it. i assume him and his donkey are still somewhere out there in the wilds as i write this."

""i can dig it."" i replied. i took a couple of tokes on this little brown cigarette and suddenly the road turned into a ribbon flowing out in front of us. i was driving about 60 mph and really digging how smooth the ride was. when we reached stinson beach parking lot, the girl said ""you can drop us off here."" i said ""no, i always have to go to the end of the road."" i noticed for the first time ever a voice in my head, a deep toned masculine voice, that asked me ""**why do you always have to go to the end of the road**?"" i was alerted to something being different at that point. when they got out of the car i said ""i hope you have a nice day.""(the expression was fairly new in '69 and had been getting critiqued in the san francisco chronicle by herb caen, who didn't much like the overuse of the expression). she leaned close to my face and said ""we hope you have a nice day."" well she knew what she was talking about i guess. i went to the beach and brought my little transistor radio and my towel and lay down on the beach. i first noticed the music was coming out of my radio in circles, directly into my ears and seemed to go on forever. it sounded wonderful. witchy tai to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg9lt4qr_dw was playing and i suddenly heard the most wonderfully magical sound i had ever heard. i sat up and looked to see what was causing it. it was the sound of some car keys in the hand of someone walking by. i looked out on the ocean and noticed that the breakers were coming in like pink cotton candy. i freaked a little noticing that things weren't real at all. i worried about myself at this point because i didn't know what was in the cigarette that i only took took puffs on. i saw a cop down the beach and considered , for a moment, turning myself in to him. at this point the voice returned in my head and said **""you know what's wrong with you, dude? you don't like people.""** i decided to go the hamburger stand and get some coffee and food, thinking this would counteract whatever i had inhaled. there was a line of 8 or so people. i turned my face away from everyone in line thinking that if they could see it they would immediately know what i was experiencing. oh yeah, almost forgot, as i was walking to the refreshment stand i noticed that i was sort of floating. my feet didn't seem to be touching the ground. while i was in line i accidentally brushed up against the person standing directly in front of me. the physical sensation was like a wave washing over my body and i nearly had an orgasm. i turned to peek at who it was that felt so good, it was a big fat hairy guy standing there. i drank 3 cups of coffee and had 2 hot dogs and went back down to my towel on the beach. my radio was gone. it had been stolen. i don't actually remember how long i lay there but the effects wore off by sunset and i drove myself home. i don't know what was in the cigarette. it smelled like pot, but obviously was soaked in something else. i have asked some friends about it and they said it sounded like pcp or some really good grass. that is my only experience with any hallucinogens this lifetime. i never smoked much pot either. i was a straight up brooks brothers suit, short haircut guy working for ibm as a sales engineer. i am 82 now and living on borrowed time."

[SEP]	not a doctor, but one night after a long day of beer and riding bird scooters, my friend had crashed his scooter and my gf had to take both our drunk asses to the er so he could get stitches. we thought it better that i just wait in the lobby as drunk me can be a bit loud. a mom walks in with her teenage son and the nurse ask them what they are in for, the teenager says my mom is freaking out because i took some lsd and starts giggling. drunk me proceeds to start yelling, he will be fine just give the poor boy some orange juice and cartoons and he will be fine. needless to say the mom wasnt a fan of my commentary, for the next hour i keep hearing him yelling from the back room about cartoons and orange juice.

[SEP]	i remember several years ago a young teenage couple had run away from home and ended up in our small town er two states away. they had split a bottle of unisom gel tablets, which is just benadryl, and then were found gorked out on the side of the road. the cops sent the girl in by ambulance and she mostly just slept and mumbled, but the boyfriend, who was a young athletic african american, they took to jail initially and then brought him to us about an hour later. theyd thought he was just drunk or something. he was definitely having some major visual hallucinations, kept saying stuff about flying monkeys and other shit, but the funniest thing he said was he when he sat straight up and started patting his legs and yelled wheres my chicken! no clue what he was thinking, but their families were able to come get them the next day.

[SEP]	a lot of ones from the rise of caesar augustus/octavian. -cleoptra was a slut who became powerful only by sex appeal. contemporary and unbiased sources actually suggest she was rather plain, but it was her intellect and charming conversation that got her power. also, as far as sexual relations go, her affairs with julius caesar and antony, as well as her traditional marriages to her brothers, arent bad compared to the well-known affairs of some other figures, especially antony. defaming cleopatra made her easier to demonize and portray as a seductress ruling over antony, making war easier for octavian. -marcus lepidus was useless. in reality, though he lacked the clout or force of personality that octavian and antony wielded, he was a competent administrator and leader who played a key role in defeating sextus pompey. he was a big enough political threat that both antony and octavian wanted him gone, but couldnt just kill him (he was forced into joining the priesthood as a solution). octavian would rather just have people forget that he wasnt the only true roman option (antony being, semi-fairly, perceived as far too decadent). -sextus pompey was a barbaric pirate king who raped and plundered the mediterranean. the youngest son of pompey magnus was likely a competent ruler, given that he held sicily and sardinia against the triumvirate with no internal attempts to unseat him. he did blockade the city of rome from its grain supply to force the triumvirs to negotiate with him, but the characterization of him as a monster is unfair. -octavian being a great military leader. all evidence points to the contrary: three great victories often are attributed to him, and we shall examine them. at mutina, where pro-senate forces fought mark antony in the chaos after caesars death, octavian was a general, but was subordinate to two other men who did much of the real leadership. these two were killed in battle, however, so octavian gets the credit. at philippi, where brutus and cassius were defeated by antony and octavian, octavians forces were overrun by brutus while, a little ways away, antony destroyed cassius army. when octavians camp was overrun, he was found to not even be present; he had claimed illness the night before and stayed away from the battle. antony had to bring his own troops around to defeat brutus. and finally, actium, where antony and cleopatra were defeated not by octavian, but his more capable subordinate, marcus agrippa. agrippa was known for his engineering and architectural skill, but was also a valuable commander (he was the man who defeated sextus pompey at sea while lepidus took his territory by land). agrippa organized the fleet at actium and was the one to lead them to victory. a lot of this was instilled by augustus rather successful record destroying once he became ruler and no one having enough power to challenge him.

[SEP]	criminal defense lawyer. i can name a few instances where i was just absolutely disgusted with my client. caveat, these are mostly years ago when i was taking just any old case. i most practice white collar and federal now. 1. i won a dui case because the government messed up on something right before trial was to begin. my client gives me a hug and completely reeks of alcohol. he has driven to court. i took his keys and called his mother. 2. client who was accused of molesting a 12 year old. he was mid 40s at the time and i had to shut him down real quick when he tried to tell me how the 12 year old was coming on to him. 3. i represented a woman for a grand theft charge. left her in my office to get some things copied before she left. after she left, i realized my sunglasses and car keys were stolen. i tracked her down in the lobby and told her i was not going to represent her anymore and i would call the police if she didnt empty her pockets in front of me and give me my things 4. i had a client who was released after 25 years in prison for murder and then the same day he beats up his prospective new landlord. he ended up getting another 10 years. he was unrepentant and laughed about how he hit the guy so hard his eye ball popped out. i thought, this guy deserves to be in prison. took the case to trial anyway and (shocker) lost and he got 10 (the max). 5. client who pretended to be a doctor so he could sell steroids. according to the gov, he had numerous clients who were made to believe that his steroids would cure their cancer. they paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars and some of them died. i just thought that was pure evil.

[CLS]	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	[SEP]	my so's mother, l, was abusive. she frequently hit her husband, was a compulsive liar, and just generally made her family miserable. when they were settling the divorce, the judge initially deemed a testimony from the kids (my so and her brother) unnecessary, probably because they were minors at the time and testifying against one of their parents would be hard on them, to say the least. however, the lawyer representing l was really insistent that they testify. well it must've been a shock to the lawyer to suddenly have two more witnesses with dozens of accounts of driving under the influence, domestic violence, ect ect. we figured l must've lied to her lawyer about some significant details because they were completely caught off guard and more than a little angry after the testimony. we like to believe it helped solidify some of the criminal charges placed against her. it was a nice bit of karma after years and years of gaslighting and false rumors, that her own lies got her caught.

[SEP]	late to the party but anyways. my first internship in law school was at a matrimonial law firm in a very wealthy area, think millionaires and billionaires getting divorced. one of the first cases i worked on involved the parents of a victim of a high-profile school shooting. the parents were divorced and had been prior to the death of the child, and were now battling over who would get the victim's compensation fund money and the funds they received from a fundraiser they set up themselves on a gofundme-type site! these were *incredibly* wealthy people fighting over what was literal chump change to them and asking the public to donate to them as if they needed it. they were so clearly exploiting the death of their child for money and to piss off the other parent, it was honestly one of the most disturbing things i have encountered, ever.

[SEP]	edit: for those asking what's wrong with allowing the child to choose. the answer is nothing, so long as the child has the maturity and mental capacity to do so, and wants to choose. this child had none of those things, and was forced to choose right then and there between two people the child loved very much. also, i'm not making any commentary on which spouse was better; they both did this, ergo, they're both terrible. not a lawyer, but was a paralegal for many years. i worked mainly in family law. as i am sure other posters are doing in order to preserve confidentiality, i am going to be vague and also not include genders or locations. i had a client who was getting divorced. the client and soon to be ex spouse had a 12 year old son with autism. the two of them sat this poor fucking child down at the table one day and made him choose which parent he wanted to live with. our client called me to gloat that the child had chosen in their favour and to direct that paperwork be prepared. this client was a prominent member of the business community and earned quite a high salary, and was treating this child like a commodity. i was disgusted. i no longer work in law, but this one will always stick with me.

[SEP]	i saw this play out in court. plaintiff was a prison guard who was pressured/forced to have sex/oral sex with her boss (the warden) on a number of occasions. the warden threatened to have her fired and blackballed if she refused or blew the whistle. after this carried on for a long while, she quit and filed a lawsuit. but unfortunately her idiot lawyer didnt timely file with the correct authorities. at the end of the day, her claim was barred and the warden enjoyed sovereign immunity. at the hearing, you could see the judge asking the prison guard questions to see if there was a workaround or some way for her complaint to survive the pending motion to dismiss. but there wasnt. that was hard to watch. it was even worse when the prison guard began to quietly cry. fortunately the warden wasnt at the hearing, and the attorney representing the state was professional and just focused on the legal arguments. he dipped out of the hearing in a hurry.

[SEP]	criminal defense attorney. i represent a guy charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, domestic battery, etc. the guy allegedly grabbed his gf from her house and took her to the nearby river to kill her. he denies this entirely. recently had a 404b hearing (where, basically, the state attempts to get his prior bad acts admitted as evidence at trial) where three prior girlfriends all testified that he strangled them, beat them, etc. at least one was hospitalized for a broken jaw. guy does not deny any of it. i was forced to cross examine all of them and the only thing i had to go on was their credibility and possible drug use/lack of memory. not effective at all. additionally, the local paper quoted me pretty much attacking these victims of domestic violence. the guy's face never changed during their testimony. realized then i do not care if he goes to prison for life because there is a zero percent chance he will not beat more women.

[SEP]	civil defense here so maybe not as juicy as the crim defense folks. some of the work i do is employment defense, particularly sexual/age harassment/discrimination cases. im pretty cynical and see a lot of cases where plaintiffs are full of shit, particularly in harassment/discrimination cases. in one case i was defending a company and that companys manager, jointly. the manager seemed like a straight up guy and i pride myself in being a good judge of character. i was pretty convinced the case was just payback from a disgruntled employee. to my credit, the plaintiff, a 38 yo female, was a really poor employee by all accounts. still, it didnt prepare me from what i found doing a review of every email the company had stored on their servers. not only did this guy stick his hand down this womans shirt without consent, when she threatened to go to hr he said hed get her fired and make sure she never got a job again. the lady was a single mother with 3 kids. he also propositioned her for sex in exchange for a day off. he thought the email had been wiped because the company had a one year retention policy. apparently, some of the companys older emails remained on a sever before the policy was put in place because of the migration of the emails from an older outsourced it company (not sure if my terminology is right here). i had to substitute out of the case thereafter for conflict reasons since my two clients interests were no longer aligned.

[SEP]	not a lawyer but i worked in a federal prison. several inmates come to mind but the one i'll tell about is a former catholic priest. he'd given up his vocation years before but he got caught up in a child porn sting. at that time sentencing was based on how many images a suspect had. he had thousands and was facing a maximum of 40 years. the guy was in his 50's so that would have been essentially a genuine life sentence, since federal inmates can only earn 15% good time. at his sentencing hearing, and i read this transcript so i know this as a fact, he told the judge when he was a priest he'd molested hundreds of young boys. despite treatment and his own remorse he felt completely incapable of stopping his obsession with child porn and with molestation. he had not ever been even charged with these crimes but he felt guilty enough to admit them and then ask the judge to impose the full penalty so he'd be locked up for the rest of his life.

[CLS]	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	[SEP]	edit: very disturbing content warning. even though ive made a throwaway im going to be a bit vague because i still take my ethical duties to former clients seriously and cant breach privilege or the nda i signed. this is a story from a long time ago, during the summer after my first year of law school when i was briefly working at a well-known criminal defense firm. the client whose case i was working was one of several defendants charged with conspiracy to commit murder. three individuals had committed the murders, and several others had either helped plan it, abducted the victims, came along to watch, or ***filmed*** it. in order to see whether our client was one of the individuals present at the scene, i had to watch multiple videos of the murders. i watched multiple people brutally killed in about the worst possible way you can imagine - >!they were chopped into pieces while they were alive and had their skulls stomped in. it wasnt some grainy security footage. it was hd video taken by bystanders just a few feet away. the videos showed someones brain squirting out of their head and another person screaming as their hands and arms were hacked off.!< i also had to listen to the audio to see if our clients voice could be heard. the screams were bad. the laughter was worse. it has stuck with me for years and years, and i dont see it going away any time soon. thankfully my internship at that firm ended a few weeks later at the end of the summer. i never looked up the sentence from the case, and have no desire to. in our case there was no presumption of innocence - the individuals involved had all taken pleas in hope that the prosecutors wouldnt seek the death penalty. the only thing that would change was whether our client would get the death penalty (if he was present/filming) or life in prison (if we showed that he played a more minimal role). working in criminal defense meant setting my judgement for people aside so that they could be afforded the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. i still did my job to the best of my ability, but i found myself lying awake at night for several weeks in a row, praying to every god that i knew that each of those motherfuckers involved would fry in the electric chair, and that someone would laugh at their screams too. after that internship, i never returned to criminal law. i now practice civil law where i help people recover for wrongs done to them.

[SEP]	my girlfriend was on the jury for a capital murder charge. he brutally raped and murdered a young mother and attempted to do the same to her toddler, who somehow miraculously (or not depending on how you look at it) survived. the son grew up and was about 14 by the time that this case was brought forward to determine if the death penalty would be used (obviously the killer had already been in prison, was found guilty long ago) or if he would avoid the death penalty and spend three life sentences in prison. he had originally attacked several women before this incident and sent two to the hospital, but was released with a slap on the wrist after serving minimal jailtime. the murder was preventable, but leniency let this violent man back out on the streets. what is sad is that every single witness for the defense was a member of his family, and every single one of them was caught lying under oath. even over the most inconsequential things. it's as if the whole family (mother, father, brothers and sisters) was physically incapable of saying anything truthful. none of them even showed any sympathy for the victims or even acknowledged that rape and murder are wrong. the killer showed no remorse either. what was really chilling, however, was the fact that every woman that he attacked looked strikingly similar to my girlfriend, and he stared at her with a blank expression almost the entire time. it really freaked her out and she still has nightmares about it.

[SEP]	former juvenile court attorney and was listening to this case, i was not involved so no rpc issue. two minors, both male, had decided to rob a pizza delivery guy, so they called for a delivery pizza to an empty apartment building, the delivery guy arrived and was subsequently robbed, something like a large pie his phone and a two liter. the minors then decide they want to take the delivery guys car, so they take his keys, while one is trying to start the car, the other decides to sexually assault the delivery guy. turns out the delivery guys car was a manual/stick shift and the minors have no idea how to drive it. instead of ending their crime spree, they then kidnap the driver and force him to drive them to their other friends house across town. once there the same minor from earlier sexually assault the pizza delivery driver again, then they beat up the delivery driver and run off. driver makes it into a local shop down the road where he calls police. adult offenders dont really bother me, but minors, their brains are not fully developed enough to understand the weight of their actions. kids can be monsters.

[CLS]	lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	[SEP]	this is tame compared to many here and involved a civil case, not criminal. it might get a bit long because this was the first case i went to court for completely solo and left a lasting impression on me. i was doing some pro bono work for a legal aid clinic very soon after i was licensed (you get to practice all different areas of law so its great for learning, and the clients get free legal help) and they gave me this very easy case to dip my toes in on. simple eviction; my clients have received notice to get out for nonpayment of rent. i meet with them and theyre basically honey boo boos parents except every negative people of walmart stereotype you can think of: very entitled and aggressive, depressingly young but with a flock of children already. the wife says shes disabled so she cant work and as part of my client intake i ask what kind of disability she has in case it might be relevant or we could provide more assistance; she looks me straight in the eye and says i dont read good. knowing that, i make sure to read out anything i ask them to sign and try to make sure they understand the process. the gist of the case was they were living in a trailer home on some guys property, had stopped paying rent several months ago (i forget their reasons, but it was more the landlord is a jerk than anything actionable), and landlord has left them a notice to get out and actually filed for eviction. i immediately notice that the letter from the landlord is defective; he doesnt include some things he should have and had not waited the required time period (to give them a chance to pay and stay) before filing in court. so basically this is going to be super easy to get dismissed, but they dont have any grounds to challenge an eviction on (place is habitable, etc) so this is just a bandaid to give them more time to get rent together or find a new place. i explain this several times and stress that they need to either move out or pay their back rent. court day comes and its in a rural county almost an hour away at jp court. (justice of the peace, where you go if you get a speeding ticket. pro-tip: in many states these judges are not required to have any formal legal training at all.) we wait, our case gets called, we go straight up to the bench to talk to the judge. this frail old man stands, shakily holding some wrinkled loose papers, and slowly shuffles to the bench. i start to feel sick. the second he gets up there and the judge asks him to speak, my clients start loudly arguing and shouting over him and i have to remind them to shut up. landlord explains that hes illiterate and had to have a neighbor write the notice for him, and adds that these tenants are horrible people and have been harassing him and his daughter. judge asks our side, and my idiot clients both start shouting again. i finally get them to shut up and say your honor, the notice was defective, we motion to dismiss and hand him my motion. this poor judges face lights up at an actual legal argument being presented and he quickly skims my motion. he immediately rules in our favor, explains to the landlord that he will need to start the process over (give them new notice, wait 20 days, refile and repay the filing fee), then turns to my clients, who have the biggest shit-eating grins, and sternly tells them the same thing i had, that this doesnt do anything but delay their eviction. we go to leave and i feel god awful watching the landlord dejectedly slump away as i walk back to my car. im already thinking eff these people, im not helping them again (i had been very clear in my client agreement that my representation was only for this one court appearance, thankfully), when i hear them hooting and jeering. i turn to look and they have rolled down their truck windows and are shouting the most vile abuse at this old man as he fumbles to get into his vehicle - including nasty things about his daughter. they tear out of the parking lot cheering like their team won the super bowl, and on the long drive back, i realize a career in this is not for me. tl;dr my clients were assholes and i helped them prolong an old illiterate mans suffering via a technicality. still feel like shit about it.

[SEP]	worked in the public defensorship in brazil (rio) and in a private law office: - had a guy brought up in the public defensorship that kidnapped his 12 year stepdaughter, took her to a city almost outside of the order of the state of rio, then made her walk through the wilderness for three days. they subsisted of nuts they found and slept in the wild, while he alledgedly raped her every day, several times a day. eventually he makes her dig her own grave and says he was gonna kill her, but then changes his mind and tells her to run. later on guy is arrested and brought to one of those cops tv shows and says in live tv how he was going to kill all of his wifes family and publically confessed to rape and more. when i got to talk with him face to face he confessed the kidnapping but denied the rape. i saw the photos of the legal examination (honestly, i think by far the worst part of working with criminal law) and there were indeed no signs of rape, but who knows. - had a guy in our office, an ex politician, we used to call him the brazilian hannibal because he was convicted of a triple murder and answering for another triple murder we cared for. guy could only communicate through video, since he was stuck in a far off jail in the amazon forest for everyones safety. - had a victim client we represented that was a dickhead - a billionaire that was swindled by his secretary. he called several times a day screaming at us and we had to basically act as his servant. during his hearing the judge asked him how he could not have noticed one time that 10k dollars had disappeared from his bank account. he said that 10k is nothing for someone who has millions. judge was not impressed by the dickishness of the statement and our guy lost that one. be aware that we prep clients before hearings but i guess he wanted to do his show. - had a case we denied legal resource because it was a confessed child rapist. we had two lawyers team, my boss refused to represent him, the other said he would but only if he was allowed to beat the shit out him. so those were my most glaring cases, but i had my fair share of pedophiles, wife beaters, racists, fraudster and pieces of shit. sometimes you also see people that were genuinely sorry for what theyve done and sometimes the actually innocent ones being dragged out through hell and back. still think criminal law is lighter than shit you see in family courts.

[CLS]	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?

[CLS]	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	[SEP]	i made a throwaway for this one. a lot of people are saying they weren't really racist, but i was. i absolutely was. i grew up in an affluent area of orange county ca. my family had money, but not nearly enough as many of the kids at my school. i was an only child, got picked on, had pretty low self-esteem. my family were basically country club racists. basically they didn't actively drop n bombs all over the place, but they had prejudices and didn't push back at all when i started saying racist things as a kid. i absolutely said the n word with my friends, laughed about it, but was always too scared to do so publically. when i got to high school, i was big into right wing politics, wanting to join the army, and learning german. i wouldn't say i was a neo-nazi, my best friend's brother was a neo-nazi and i didn't hang out with any of his friends or want to go into that scene, but i often thought that i would have made a good nazi had i been a german during the third reich. i definitely had friends in high school, but i wanted to go to college in a place that was more conservative and less diverse than i currently was. i figured my life would improve if i went to a place like that. so what changed? i did move to a small midwest town and started taking german in college for real, i took history courses that kind of started to chip away at my view of the world. studying abroad in germany though my junior year is what really started to break the glass on my views. i thought that my german background and last name would win me some favors over there, but people didn't really give a shit at all. i saw that modern germany was categorically and vastly different than the one i crafted in my head. i made friends from all over europe and the world. i had some people i cared about really roast me for some nationalist and militaristic views i had, it made me really mad at the time but eventually, i took their criticism seriously. i came back and finished doing some work in history classes and wrote a paper on nazi propaganda. it was then that i really examined nazi viewpoints through recent experience sand saw how fucking dumb they were. i remember seeing a poster and the text said that the jews were both behind communism and capitalism and just thought, this is just complete fucking nonsense and the people who believe this are morons. i actually did go into the military, i did rotc in college and my time in rotc and active duty pretty much flushed the rest out of me. getting to know, working with, and leading people from different backgrounds and getting to see things through their eyes was an invaluable experience. so to summarize, meeting people from different backgrounds is probably the most important for me and really actually having meaningful conversations, and not walking way when you're challenged. the thing is, i didn't just say 'you're right, nationalism and being racist is wrong i get it now' when i was in germany. i fought back, i defended myself, i thought these people were just butthurt leftists and weren't going to take anything i said seriously anyway. but those conversations planted the seeds that grew over several months, and eventually, they made me recognize how wrong i was. second was i always knew it was wrong to hate people, but i still did. i didn't have an online support structure to keep me in the mindframe. had these online communities existed 10 years ago, i don't know if i could have broken out of this. edit: let me just add because people are seeing this. you often hear that hate is a poison. a huge part of being such a racist is being angry that so much of the world that doesn't conform to your narrow views of what a society should look like. you waste so much energy being so angry all the time. everytime you see a group of people in a place where you don't think they should be, or a couple of different ethnicities, or hearing different languages where you don't think you should be hearing them, you just react to this with anger it's just so fucking poisonous. once i started to let go of this a little bit, i tried to think about these feelings and wondered why i felt them. why were all of these people making me so angry? and why did i think it would be so much better if i was somewhere else? the answer, of course, were problems in my own life, my own feelings of inadequacy, my feelings i squandered a privileged background and couldn't meet my parents' expectations. once i started making those connections and take steps to improve the things in my own life i could control, i felt a lot better about myself and felt that i had a lot more to value in myself than being just a white guy from newport. hate really is poisonous. it poisons your self-image, your impression of others, your sense of empathy, your ability to humanize problems, your ability to connect with friends and family. but it doesn't have to be a death sentence, you can break out of the negatively reinforcing thought process. start by reading stories of people who are totally different from you, watch movies made by people like this, just try and kickstart the apparatus in all of us to give a shit about people. i've had the opportunity to travel to so many places since my first time in germany and the thing i've learned above all else is people by and large want the same things, to live somewhere cool, the hang out with their friends, provide for their families, etc. i'm sorry that it took me a while to learn this, but i do hope someone can see this and start have a gutcheck moment with themselves to think differently about how you think of others. edit2: go figure, i have a reddit account for 5 years and my first gold is on a throwaway where i confess to having been a bad human being. thanks for the gesture, but please, give it to someone more deserving	[SEP]	4680

(yep, literally, mexican ""n"" word is what my dad taught us to call them) well anyways, my deep hate for non-whites/non-christians was deeply rooted thanks to my parents. until in 2011, a tornado outbreak swept through the south. i did a lot of voluntary work, met some black people, but was still worried about being around them. until about a week or two later when our school reopened. we had a lot of new kids from various areas that were damaged. most of them black. so the next school year i get partnered up with this black girl in our history class, and i'm mostly focused on our project, but we ended up talking for a while. she ended up being my first girlfriend a few weeks later, and after i met her family and learned what they went through because of the 2011 outbreak, plus her parents were from birmingham during the civil rights movements, i started to learn that love is more powerful than hate. that ability to make someone smile, there's nothing better than that. while me and her broke up later on, she had a massive impact on my life. i still live in alabama, and i still hear racist remarks from my parents, and from strangers. they will pass away, and sure they may have already left behind their mark of hatred. but hate can be erased with love."

(for the first time i was talking to a person of color like a person) after some time i became friends with the nurse, calling her sometimes just to talk with her. my brother couldnt speak, but i could see that he was a bit pissed. then one day my family came to visit again. i was very thirsty so i called for the nurse again. she arrived and my dad's eyes went up in flames, yelling how a ""animal"" could work in a hospital and treat his son. he consulted the doctor and she was forbidden from coming to our room. i was let go after 2 months, i never saw the nurse after the incident. but i realised what i was dealing with, my family is a bunch of racist assholes. when i came back to school, i instantly tried making friends with the black kids, but the damage has been done. due to my previous behavior they wouldnt hang out with me, and my old friends abandoned me because i was trying to make friends with black kids. we moved to the large city 7 moths later. there i instantly made friends with the kids of color. which was a shock to both other kids and teachers. that day when i came home i was yelled at and grounded ""forbidden"" from hanging out with them. i continued to be friends with them. my parents are still a bit pissed about everything, but soon im going to uni so i can hang out with anyone, no matter thier race, religion and other bullshittery."

[SEP]	i grew up fearing black people. every time we got robbed, it was a black person. my mom got dragged out of her car when she was pulling in to the driveway and it was by two black men. i grew up with this fear/hate because every time my family was hurt by outside forces it seemed to be black people. what finally took me out of that fear and hurt was when i found myself struggling when i was 18. this older black lady saw me crying cause i couldnt afford to pay for gas and was essentially stranded(i was living in my car at that point in time) she filled up my gas tank and gave me her number and told me if i ever needed gas money that basically she has my back. a complete stranger showing me compassion. the people that my parents told me to look out for when i was younger , they are the ones who lended a helping hand to me when i was at rock bottom. not even my own parents, my own blood offered to help. that resonated deeply within me. and honestly im happy it happened that way. i love all of you.

[SEP]	"i grew up in the rural south in the us. i was raised by a family of racists. both sets of grandparents and both parents told me horrible, horrible things growing up. here are things that i have heard/continue to hear from my family (i want to cry now as i write this). my paternal grandmother used to tell me that you can't trust n*****s because they are all theives and liars, that she would beat us (me and my brother) if we ever brought home a black girl, and that anyone who liked black people was a n*****-lover. my paternal grandfather used to regularly refer to president obama as a ""big-eared n*****"" and had a racist statue of a young black boy with pitch black skin and big, bright red lips eating a watermelon, on which he painted the word ""obama"" across the forehead. when my mother was a child, she was taken out of her school and moved an hour away just so she wouldn't have to go to school with black kids when the schools in the area were *finally* desegregated. her father has said, many times, that he would rather my brother and i be dead than marry a black woman (except he didn't say black). my grandmother on that side once told me that there were three things i better not ever do: (1) smoke, (2) drink, and (3) date a black girl (jokes on her, i've done all three). fun fact. both of my grandfathers are preachers. when i was a child, my mom used to have this exchange with me a lot: mom: ""guess what?"" me: ""what?"" mom: ""you're a n***** and i'm not."" i guess i've never really been a racist myself, but i have behaved in racist ways throughout my life in an effort to fit in. i only say all of this to show that racism is never something you are born with, it is something that the ignorant and weak-minded pass on to their children. what changed for me was that i realized that my family were uneducated, willfully ignorant, bigots who never questioned the awful things they were taught as children. i am grateful for the internet and technology, because without them, i may have ended up the same. i wish i could say that they are different now but in the age of donald trump, they have tripled down with their racism. i wish i could open their eyes to the things they don't see in the world, but now my only option has been to sever all ties with anyone other than my brother. we are super liberal now and despise our family."

[CLS]	ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	[SEP]	not really ever a racist, but could have been. as a kid, racism was fairly normal. people applied labels to each other and assembled in groups that looked alike. in my area, there wasnt a lot of animosity or violence, but there was tension. as a kid, i was probably spared a lot of direct racism. at the same time, i realized that while my friends looked different, we were otherwise largely the same, focused on spelling and math and recess. the names were hurtful, and the divide unnecessary. we all agree to not perpetuate the things. since then, the differences in people are just visual. i prefer to celebrate and learn from the diversity and differences. honestly, i have a harder time with accents and colloquiums than i do with anyones origin, no matter how you choose to trace that. the problem is mine, too, not theirs, in that i just sometimes take a pass or two to get the sentiment or gist or straight verbiage because of yall instead of you all or whatever.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	former boy scout here. i worked a summer camp in missouri one summer. one week we had a troop of mentally disabled guys stay at the camp. they were all older than standard boy scouts. one i took a liking to. big dude who you would be frightened to death to cross on a dark street. but he was mentally a 5-year old. he had zero confidence. i wanted to work on that. so i guide him all week but make sure he does as much on his own as humanly possible. we get to woodworking day and i help him construct as much as he feels he can. he just doesnt want to use the hammer to sink the nails. i do a few but notice every single thing he does, he does better than he feels and i decide im going to have him do it, whatever the cost. i give him the hammer. he declines. i tell him i believe in him. he declines. i say, tell you what. ill hold the nail for you, i trust you that much. i know you wont hurt me. he took the hammer. i hold the nail. i bit down hard expecting a broken finger. **whack** that nail went down like it was made of butter. he didnt even pinch my finger as the head of the nail went down. he hit it perfectly. he saw it and dropped the hammer and started wringing his hands and tried to be excited without making a scene. my heart was so full for him. i felt amazing for taking that risk. that was over 20 years ago, and ive never forgotten it. i now have two young daughters who i put my physical self on the line for regularly. sometimes it works out. sometimes i gain new scars. but i know being the someone who trusts you no matter what makes any physical pain not even a consideration.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i (riding on my bike) saw a man lying on his back in the middle of an adjacent sidewalk. while it's fairly common around here to find homeless people passed out in doorways and whatnot, and therefore relatively easy to ignore, this guy was different. nicely dressed, clean, not obviously homeless, and really, really still. nobody was stopping. it was in broad daylight. i got off my bike and checked on him - his eyes were rolled back in his head, then would randomly roll around, his pulse was weak and slow, he was breathing, but very slowly and shallowly. once i stopped people started getting interested, but when i asked someone to call 911, everyone took off. i called them myself, and they wanted me to do cpr. i only had one functioning arm, so i again asked for help. all the rubberneckers again disappeared. fortunately an ambulance arrived quickly. i still don't know what happened to him, but i hope he was okay. i also called 911 for a guy that was obviously homeless, and drunk, at night in a mostly deserted area, because he was passed out face down on a sidewalk with a nearly empty bottle of bourbon in his hand, and a growing puddle of blood stemming from where he slammed his head when he fell down. i would rather risk some personal safety than wonder if another human bled out because i didn't want to be bothered. yes, i understand not stopping to help a guy in a van on the side of a deserted road in the middle of the night, or another dozen other scenarios. get somewhere safe and call the police! but i'm baffled as to how people can just flow around a person in need in broad daylight in a well-populated area.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i helped a waitress at a restaurant i frequent. after a few months of patronage i knew most of the staff and was on a first name basis with them. i learned that she was working 6 days per week, 8 to 10 hours per day, *and* going to school full time (5 days per week, 6 hours per day), *plus* she traveled by bus between 2 and 3 hours per day. a quick bit of mental math. on a bad day she could spend 19 hours with her obligations, not counting bathing, eating, or homework! and after she paid for her tuition, she only had 10% of her paycheck left over. as i have no family nor children of my own, i decided to pay for her university. she has since quit her job and is focusing on her studies. she regularly sends me updates about her classes and i'm happy to report she's getting straight 'a's as a psychology major.

(which i didn't see as the biggest issue right then.) we were almost at the end by then, so i figured the kindest thing would just be to give up on getting in at a good place, and encourage her to the end as she wasn't giving up. i gave her my arm, and half carried her to the finish line. i let her finish the place before me, because she had worked a lot harder on that race than anyone else. i haven't seen her since, and i can't even remember her name, but i hope she's doing well.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i persuaded my boss to give my autistic colleague a raise because she deserved it and would never go to ask herself. edit: thanks for all the lovely reactions, silver and gold! i'll explain the situation a bit further since this got a lot of upvotes. i work for a company that sells steel parts and we had a client that required every purchase of a particular steel grade to be hardness tested in a very tedious and antiquated way. it was a repetitive job and the colleague i'm referring to was hired for it because of her autism. the company got subsidized to employ her and she liked the routine of the job. we work with a small team in the warehouse, which is in another city than the sales office (and manager/ceo) is located. it's a relatively small company and we don't have any scheduled hr talks or whatever. so if you don't make an appointment with the manager our wage or work is just never discussed. that's why i took the initiative to negotiate (without her knowing) to get her a pay raise. i had a very good relationship with her, we had become good friends. due to the pleasant atmosphere in our team she had also blossomed into a much more all-round worker than what she was initially hired for. she's just a smart and kind hearted woman with a lot of humor, but very unconfrontational and socially anxious due to her autism. bad experiences with people exploiting her in her previous jobs had made this worse throughout the years. in our team she was fully accepted. she worked hard and efficiently without ever complaining. so it was right for her to get a raise and she would have never gotten it spontaneously. i only did what i thought was right. when i told her she got a raise she was super happy, in tears. we are still friends and see each other, even though she is retired now. yesterday i had lunch at her house, which we do every couple of months. and she told me more than once how happy she is that the last job of her career was such a positive experience.

[SEP]	i used to work in the visitors clubhouse for a single a baseball team. i'd also help do things on the home side, and during the game if i got what i needed to get done done, i could watch a few innings. all that is to say i didn't spend all my time in the visitor's locker room. after the game was over, one of the visiting players came up and told me he was missing money from his wallet, something like $150. there's very limited access to the clubhouse. besides me and like 1 or 2 other guys, it'd only be members of their team. i didn't want to think any of his teammates did it, and i didn't want to chance wrongly accusing any of my clubhouse coworkers. i ended up just giving him $150 of my own money (the job paid terribly but i got $45 a night for doing the laundry so i had cash on me). i wasn't living paycheck to paycheck or anything, but still. &#x200b; the front office ended up finding out about it, and i got a bunch of coupons for free stuff from businesses who sponsored the team which was nice.

[SEP]	"for my best friend's 30th birthday i wanted to give him something awesome because he's been amazing, supportive, and such a positive influence in my life. i wanted something meaningful to show just how much i appreciate him. he's really big into vinyl records, so i decided to have a record made of some of our recordings from when we were in a band together in high school. the front of the album was this really cool picture of our band's name i had painted on my parent's garage that we used as a band picture for this small street festival we played at. the back of the record was a black and white picture of the basement where we used to practice. i took that picture when our friend's parents (he was the drummer) sold the house and we were helping them move stuff out of it. the recordings i chose were from this practice session that i call ""good friday"" because we did it on a good friday we had off of school. it's not the greatest sounding recording we ever did (we used a boombox to record our stuff) but that day we ended writing and recording a song all three of us really liked within the span of like a couple of hours. we were never really great or played many shows, but the time we spent practicing and goofing off in that basement and going to the diner or the mexican restaurant for tacos afterward are some of the happiest memories i have from high school. [here's a picture from when i gave it to him.](https://i.imgur.com/lsvk8ci.jpg) i don't think i will ever be able to top that gift, but it meant so much to me to see how happy it made him."	[SEP]	459
[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i met a girl on myspace (this was back in the day) when i was just randomly messaging people that looked interesting. over the course of three days realized she was very suicidal. she had a plan of when and how she would kill herself (that evening) and the method was lethal. i worked as a counselor at the time, so i knew this was incredibly serious. she had written me earlier in the day about her plan. when i saw the messages a few hours later and responded, she did not respond and i freaked out. all i knew was her name and the city she lived in, so i called the police there and they were able to track her through her ip address. while all of this was playing out, it was the longest two hours of my life. they got to her house in time and she was taken to a psychiatric hospital. the police called me to tell me that she was okay and later on her mom called me crying and thanking me. the girl called me after she got out of the hospital and thanked me. she asked me why i cared so much to go through all that to keep her from committing suicide and i was taken aback. i told her she was a person and even though i didn't know her very well, i certainly didn't want her to die and i cared about her. we've hung out a few times and we're still friends on social media. her life has had ups and downs, but man, i'm so glad she's alive to experience it all. i have no doubt she would be dead if i hadn't been randomly messaging people on myspace. for anyone that does not know regarding suicide: when the person has a timeline of when they want to do it, it's serious. when they have a plan of how they would do it and the plan is feasible, it's serious. when the method they are selecting is lethal, it's serious. they need professional help if they are at those points and having all three means they need intervention asap.

(i assumed one of them was his mom.) finally they pulled far enough ahead of him he recognized he wouldn't be able to catch up and he stopped walking and started crying. the ""mom"" in me kicked in. i held out my arms in the universal ""let me pick you up"" gesture and he immediately raised his arms to allow me pick him up. i did so and power walked as fast as i could to catch up with the group he was following. when i got them to stop i was shocked to find out he wasn't theirs! i'm thinking oh crap?!? who does this baby belong to?!? then a lady at the back of the group recognized him and said she knew his mom but she had no idea they were at the mall that day. we decided to take him back the direction i we all came from and hope for the best. about halfway back through the mall we see mall security with a frantic/distressed woman speaking rapidly in a foriegn language. her approximately 12 year old daughter looking pale and scared nearby. i knew immediately this was the boys mom. i walked up to her, she looked at me confused, then saw her son in my arms. i'll never forget the look of relief on her face as i handed him to her. she hugged him tightly, crying, kissing him, yelling at her daughter. my guess is big sister was supposed to be watching him and didn't pay close enough attention. i gave mom a hug. waived at security and left. hopefully big sister and mom pay closer attention in the future. that could have ended up way worse.

[SEP]	i try to do a lot of nice things when no one is looking, it helps me sleep at night. i held my landlord while she cried herself to sleep because her husband left her. i held my best friends brother as his grandmother took her last breath, rubbing his back and telling him she's in a better place now. bought several coworkers, friends and strangers groceries when they've been struggling paycheck to paycheck. someone did that for me once and it meant the world not needing to go hungry until payday. took three separate people into my home when they were struggling, mentally, emotionally or financially so they could get on their feet again. one divorce, one lost their job and one was getting clean of drugs. two of the three turned it around and are doing really well. i've given what i could spare, food or otherwise to homeless people but one in particular that stands out. turns out the guy ran out of gas and was stranded for the better part of a day, pretty much cried when i offered to buy him some gas. i was sitting in a road construction hault, literally in the middle of no where, four hours from any city and i saw an old man hitch hiking. for some reason i had this feeling that i needed to help him (i've never picked up a hitch hiker before). the man was fleeing a fire that destroyed his home, slept on the side of the road and had gone an entire day without water. he was in bad shape. he also grew weed to give to nuns and they turned it into cbd for cancer patients. i find that it's the little things we can do when someone is in need. but what i've done for people has been done for me ten times over by strangers. today you, tomorrow me.

[SEP]	"about more than 10-11 years ago back when i was a high school senior, i attended a birthday party of a friend of mine at her house. i remember feeling a *little* out of place there as the other teens there were the kind of edgy anime loving, linkin' park listening, [amv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anime_music_video) creating, [kingdom hearts parking lot-ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kifn5nvxu) teens (gamer nerd, wasn't too deep into anime culture then). but, i wasn't the real outcast there. there was a freshman girl there (henceforth she'll be referred to as *bree*) who wasn't well liked apparently. never met her before, but i noticed she was taking a hell of a verbal beating from other girls there for a while (not even sure who these bullies were or why were they invited). from what i've noticed bree seemed to have a kind of personality that would get annoying to others: little whiny, seemingly clumsy, easy to agitate, ""unattractive"" to shallow people. knowing how evil us young li'l shits can be you can easily guess a person like this will be bullied. half way through the day, bree couldn't take the bullying anymore and got into a shouting match with the other girls. this ended up with her storming to the back corner of the back yard, sitting on a swing-set crying. i typically really hate getting into the business of other people because i wasn't too socially confident then but at this point i kinda felt bad. i remember thinking to myself the idea of a party is to have fun and not be miserable so i decided to have a chat with her. sat down to the empty swing next to bree and asked her what's going on. (as linkin park is blasting in the background.) she told me these girls were always talking shit and bullying her for the way she was. told me about how she wanted to be left alone. i explained to bree about the personal bullying i've dealt with for a huge portion of my life at school since 5th grade. told her that i'm a huge black gaming nerd with a short-fuse and thin skin and how this is a terrible combination for bullies to exploit. told her about how fellow black classmates rejected me because i was considered to be ""too white"". told her about pointless fights i've gotten into. i told her it took me til i hit my sophomore year of high school to really understand things and realize what these bullies say to you doesn't matter a lick of shit. how they enjoy getting that rise out of you when you cry and scream back at them. i remember having a reasonably long discussion about how she'll get through this and come out a stronger person and how liberating it is to show off to these bullies how little of a flying fuck you give about what they say. how it feels goooood when you've gained immunity from their shit and watch them make fools of themselves. in the end, [~~it doesn't even matter~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evtxpuf4oz4) bree lightened up and thanked me for helping her feel better. she ended up clinging to me for the rest of that day but i didn't mind. i know how it feels to be alone. i do know the two bullies noticed what happened and made some dumb ""hiding behind your new boyfriend?1"" jokes though i think she took a little of what i said to heart and ignored it. .unfortunately after that party, i never saw her again. hope she's doing well out there. ^(and unfortunately to me, as i write this i realize this was probably the closest in my entire life i've ever been with another female.) tl;dr, fuck bullies, mang. this ended up being much longer than i wanted it to be, but i guess i felt the need to share as i never really talk about this to anyone."

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	when i was in my early 20's, a young woman around my age crashed her car into my workplace and died in the parking lot. it was pretty traumatic on all fronts. a few days later, one of her brothers came by and asked to speak with anyone who had witnessed the crash. he just wanted some closure on his sister's last moments. i spoke with him for a long time, and found that the girl who died was a mother of three children - the youngest being just two weeks old. she had severe post-partum depression, and it is thought that the crash may have been intentional on her part. this hit me so hard, having suffered with severe depression and suicidal thoughts myself, and the girl being my age. the children went to live with the girl's mother, who already had several other children at home to support. they were very, very poor. i helped them with fundraising enough to barely scrape together a modest funeral service. this happened in the summer, and i stayed in touch with the girl's mother and brother periodically to see how they were doing. around christmas time, i thought of all those kids living with the mother, and how they would have nothing. at the time, my own parents were still budgeting a fair amount for christmas presents for me - i think it was around $200. that year, i asked them if i could just use the money to buy gifts and clothes for those children. so i did. i did the same every year after that for four years, until i stopped hearing back from the girl's mother. i'm not sure what happened to her, or why she stopped responding. but i never heard from her again. i still wonder how those kids are doing. and i still can't pass a car accident on the road, even a minor one, without breaking down and losing my shit. rip kendra.

[SEP]	i don't know if it was the nicest thing but i felt really happy doing it. i was by myself on a 10 hour flight back home . when i got to my seat i realized that i was given the best seat in coach. you know that seat they sell or give to mothers with babies that doesnt have anyone in front of you. you can get up whenever you want and not worry about being squished by the person next to you. my dream seat. as the plane was about to take off an older woman was sitting with her adult daughter. the seat next to me was empty (i was extra happy about that). the daughter asked the flight attendant if her mother could move to the seat next to me because her legs were bothering her and she had poor circulation. the flight attendant said yes but that she had to wait until the plane was in the air and seat belt signs came off. when that time came, the woman attempted to get up to move but a young woman who appeared extremely nauseous or just sick beat her to the seat. when they told the flight attendant that that was supposed to be for her mom, they were told oh well she got there first. basically i just told them to take my seat. i sat with the daughter and the older lady was so happy. they were so happy and couldn't believe someone would give up their seat like that. there's no way i could have stayed in my seat and rested knowing that lady really needed it. made my day.

[SEP]	woman was caught stealing a little over $250 worth of merchandise by loss prevention at a local big box store a few weeks before christmas. she ended up having a pretty extensive history of theft unfortunately. she was crying and telling me about how her husband is a controlling drunk that doesnt give her access to their bank accounts. i looked at all the merchandise she attempted to steal. every single thing was essentials for her kids. snow pants, boots, gloves, and some toiletrys. after giving her the citation for theft(which i have no choice on because the store wished for her to prosecuted), i bought everything and then a toy for each of her kids. total was a little over $400. i then contacted and got her in touch with a victim advocate to try and get her into a better situation. ive bought stuff in the past for people down on their luck, but this was by far the most ive ever spent.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	my college used to be ten minutes walk from my home. i used to walk there daily and see an old homeless lady on the way. i used to give her some coins and a smile whenever i saw her. you may not believe in this, but whenever i used to see the lady, my day turned into a lucky day like a blessing. my end semester exams were approaching and i wish i could have taken her blessings for my exams. but she was nowhere to be seen. she represented an occurrence in my everyday routine that made me feel happy. however, as soon as my exam started, i saw her again everyday and fortunately my exams went well! finally, at the end of my exam days, i took her to a tea shop. the tea shop owner gave us tea in two cups. as soon as i gave the tea to the lady, the shopkeeper asked me not to give her the cup and that hell provide a plastic disposable glass for her. he started snatching the cup from the old lady. i didnt like that and i asked what happened. he wanted to explain but he didnt have any real reason to say. i realized he was biased towards her because of her appearance. i told him she is a human being like us and certainly can drink tea cup. you should have seen the smile on her face and others around us. what a lovely day. i hope she's okay.

[SEP]	i went to highschool with someone who was on the spectrum, and had some trouble making friends. we weren't close at all, but knew each other purely because we went to a small school. fast forward about 6 years, and i see a post on their social media where they mentioned how they're down on luck. they needed to move apartments, but recently had surgery so they couldn't lift anything or pack for themselves. they didn't have any friends willing to help, and couldn't afford a moving company. i sent them a message, drove over and packed, then moved, their entire apartment across town for them. they tried to pay me what they could, but i just asked them to pay it forward. we still stay in touch!

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	this probably isn't the nicest thing, but it's very memorable. i once had this old guy, he religiously used to walk to the pizza place near my house most nights, i'd be biking around and see him and just feel sad because of how lonely he was. as well, he also used to sit on a bench not too far from the shops (about a block away) and drink, which is where i saw him a lot too. one night i'm at the shop, he comes out with two bags full of stuff, i offer to carry them for him, and to my pleasant surprise he accepts. trailing my bike whilst carrying his bags, we engaged in a blunt conversation, he told me pieces of his life and how he was in a war (i can't remember what because my memory is awful). i walked him back to the bench, where we sat and talked some more. then i walked him back to his care home. i never saw him out much after this, and after a while i hadn't seen him for months. this was three years ago, he's most likely passed now, but it's still a pleasant memory.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i accidentally bought two front row tickets to miley cyrus/hannah montana concert years ago for my brother and cousin, thinking they were $500+ together and 5th row-center. turns out i spent $1000 dollars and my parents had already bought them tickets. i started to try and get it refunded immediately, but then, for reasons i honestly cant explain because i was always rather selfish, i wanted to do something good. i called around to some of the local childrens hospitals and one had two terminally ill little girls who were obsessed about miley and this tour. we discussed how to go about donating so i gave them all the information to pass along to the parents. not long after, the hospital called and asked if i would be willing to meet with the parents because they wanted to meet me. i though sure, why not? i never anticipated how much that would change my life. i met both those girls and their parents. we smiled, laughed, and cried together. i later got a thank you letter from them with a picture of both the girls together which i still have today. it reminds me why i try to be a better person everyday.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	my mom's best friend since teenage years (i considered her an aunt) has always lived a financially struggling life, but she has been one of my best friends for as long as i can remember. about 2 years ago, she decided to go to a job somewhere out of state. i'm not fully aware of how the training was, but it was to become a truck driver for a company. anyways, i was making decent money as a server and was able to manage my bills while enjoying life at times. when she was in training, her food/clothes that was supposed to be sent to her were being delayed, so she had no money and nothing to eat. she started a gofundme for $500 to be able to survive the next couple weeks. when i noticed the gofundme on facebook, i saw she only raised $150, so i sent her the remaining $300. today, she is much happier and making good money driving trucks, and stops in town every so often to hang out with me.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	when i was about 14 (almost 16 years ago now) i was at a local park and this little girl (6 or 7) was walking her small maltese looking dog. a guy came in with these 2 massive dogs off their leashes. as soon as these other dogs spotted the smaller one, they attacked it. the small dog was running circles around the little girl, tangling her in its leash. i marched over between them told her to drop the leash and carried her over to some bleachers and burried her head in my chest and told her not to look and plug her ears. her family lived next door to the park, heard the commotion and came running. the guy ditched his dogs and took off, the little girls family chasing after. someone in her family came and took her from me and i walked home without a word. i wonder about her some times. amazingly, i heard the little dog lived from some of my neighbors.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	was driving through a neighborhood and came across an old woman unconscious on her driveway. she came around once i walked up to her. looked like she fainted and fell face first onto the concrete. she didnt want to go to the hospital but i convinced her to let me call her doctor who had an office just a few blocks away. ended up physically carrying her into the office from my car because she was too unstable to walk. she didnt have any family locally so the doctors office took care of her then called me to pick her up a few hours later. took her home and got a sweet grandma hug from her. that was years ago and i never saw her again. but i still remember her name almost 30 years later.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i was walking home from a convenience store and saw this woman on her hands and knees in front of her car, looking for something in her handbag. it seemed like she was struggling. i almost walked past like everyone else but decided to go check if she was okay. she was shaking a lot. she told me she was looking for her car keys in her bag just before pulling them out. she then struggled to get up so i gave her a hand and asked if there's anything else i can do. the woman asked if i could put her shopping bags in the passenger seat of her car, so i did. then she asked if i could put her crutches in there too, so i picked them up and started walking round to the other side of her car. i quickly glanced at some text on her crutches and read the words '.parkinsons charity.'! it all made sense now, the reason why she was shaking so much and struggling to stand up on her own. i'm glad i was able to help her, and she seemed very grateful for it.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	eight or so years ago i was taking my dog for a walk on a sunday morning and passed an older woman - probably in her 80s - waiting for a city bus to go to church. when i passed back by her a half an hour later she was still waiting. what she did not know was that the bus service on that street had been canceled for that morning because of the big marathon that was running through our city. i let her know that and she started to walk home, defeated. i ran after her and offered to drive her to church. ended up jogging back home, getting my car, going back to pick her up and then driving her to her church about 7 miles away.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i normally keep stuff like this to myself but yeah i've done my fair share of helping other people. the most recent one i had was around 3 weeks ago. end of the month so kinda running broke. happen to take the metro instead of public bus that day. i had around 300 rupees {5 usd roughly). a family approached me - a couple with 3 small kids. they were obviously in a very shitty condition, clothes torn, the typical below poverty line family. i was standing at the ticket counter and was alone at the time because i had just gotten back from my training. the mom was crying and seeing them in an instant told me that yeah they really needed help. so i buy the family all metro tickets to get to wherever they are going and gave them the rest of all the money i had for food. seeing the dad cry and tell me that this was the best thing someone has ever done for them, him pouring his eyes out telling me this gave me this unexplainable sense of satisfaction that i indeed just helped someone who so desperately wanted the support. i've been in situations in the past where things weren't going so smooth and putting myself in this family's shoes and feeling their struggles gave me the best sleep i've ever had in a while. hope that family is doing well.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	my sister (sorority/best friend, no blood relation) called me at 9 p.m. about a year ago, and told me she was being admitted to a mental health facility and she needed me to be there. it was the day before her birthday, and her parents were out of the country and her sibling was still underage/unavailable at the time. she'd been having problems with her so at the time, they'd been together for forever and had moved in together as the next step in their relationship and to say things weren't going well is a massive understatement. they were going through couples therapy to try and work things through, but it wasn't helping. she was having very bad episodes with her mental health and feared she was going to commit suicide. so i packed her favorite snacks, some clothes, and myself into my car and drove over. as it turns out the only other person willing to be there at the time to help her check in was her so, and it was not a good thing for him to be there. it was too toxic. so she and i sat in the intake room for over two hours together talking through the events leading to this point, just talking in general, getting her professor's names and contacting our campus to get her an advocate/dean who could help manage the situation, and once midnight hit, celebrating her birthday before she was admitted and taken to her room. since her family wasn't available i was named as an advocate/guardian/witness temporarily until her family could return and take over for her care (we were both over 18). she spent two weeks in the facility, and i visited as much was allowed, communicated to her advocate/dean as much as i could and helped rearrange the schedules so she could complete her work and semester. i helped keep her parents updated on her progress, and when she was eventually released, i helped her move out of her and so's place and back to her parent's house. unluckily for her trying to find the right prescriptions was a bit of a challenge in the following weeks as she had a few bad reactions and i had to rush her to urgent care/er more than once. even more unluckily, while in the facility her so had decided to cheat on her and then break up with her the day after she was cleared and released. it was a rough few weeks. she and i are only a year and a half apart in age and at the time i was graduating from undergrad, applying to grad school, managing an organization, dealing with my research projects, and just trying to keep my in head above water. but knowing she needed me, it was an easy choice to give her the support she needed over my own stuff. she's doing very well now, set to graduate soon, a wonderful new so who respects her and treats her well, her family and friends have rallied around her, she's my best friend and sister in every sense of the words. i'm very excited to watch her accept that diploma because she was so certain at one point that she'd never make it here. she's my hero and i'm so proud of her. edit: words.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	had a man come up to me outside a local pizza place when i was 17. he looked ragged and totally emaciated. he asked if i had some spare cash so he could eat (pizza place was cheap and good). i said sure and handed him a $50 gift card my dad had gotten me for my birthday. at 17 that's all the money in the world. literally a month of pizza with friends. i got in my car and while waiting for a friend to show up, i could see an argument inside the store. there was a dispute between the guy and the girl behind the register. i went in and asked what the problem was. was the gift card empty? had i unintentionally been an asshole? no. the guy had tried to buy a ridiculous amount of beer. the pizza place didn't sell to him because he had no id on him (and was obviously a homeless trouble maker) and he got *angry*. he got kicked out. i told her i had given him the card (she saw the exchange happen) and asked for it back. i got him a large pizza and handed it to him outside when it was ready. went back to my car and watched him toss in in the dumpster without taking a bite.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	probably saving a life. i was 20, at university, and had just finished my lecture and walked home when i decided i was going to food shopping since i had finished at 1pm. so i drive to the shop, park up and go in. the place was busy and i was walking up the first isle near the back when all of a sudden a woman started high pitch screaming & shouting in a different language. i turn to my right and she is pointing at a baby her husband is holding belly down. nobody moved. i ran over and you could tell the baby was choking. i basically slapped the baby's back and the piece of crisp came shooting out. the woman was so thankful, literally hugging me. i have super bad anxiety, so i literally was like its fine and basically ran out the shop, leaving my basket. they both came out as i got to my car door and was so thankful, the baby was fine, back to her happy self. afterward, i sat in my car for a good 20 minutes shaking, going through the whole scene in my head. i really started to worry if i had slapped the back of the baby too hard and ended up hurting her from dislodging the crisp. but thankfully, her dad had checked her over and she was fine.

[SEP]	there was a young couple- in maybe their late teens- with a small baby at the mall getting pictures with santa. it was clearly their little ones first santa picture. their stroller looked a bit tatty and the parents looked a bit worse for wear. i was standing nearby doing bell-ringing for charity when i overheard them discussing in line how they could only get the one picture. while they were getting the picture taken i paid for the biggest set of pictures the place provided and quietly went back to my post. i remember seeing the mom going through change in her purse when the photo person stopped her. i'm assuming telling them the pictures were paid for. the parents teared up. they came back to the booth 10 minutes later and took their big envelope of pictures with huge smiles on their faces. i hope everyone they know got a picture!

[SEP]	i was at a gas station at around 7:30 at night. i was just coming home from work and i needed to fill my tank for the morning. i got out of my car, put my debit card info in, and start filling my tank. i then look to my right to see my ex girlfriend who was crying on the curb by the coffee shop. i havent spoke to her in years. i approached her and asked her what was the matter. she was surprised and excited to see me at the same time. she said she was on a date with the boy she was dating (who was known to be a jerk) she went inside to get something to drink while he was putting gas and he left without her. we both doubted it was unintentional so i helped her up and told her ill take her home. she lived 20 minutes away so it wasnt bad. when we got to her house she profusely thanked me and insisted we get back in touch, not as boyfriend and girlfriend but as good friends. i was more then fine with that.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i found someone collapsed on the side of the road and called 911, administered cpr and also mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance got there. she had turned blue and wasnt breathing and had vomit and a swollen tongue obstructing her airway. i turned her on her side, scooped out the vomit, pried her teeth apart and started switching between cpr & mouth-to-mouth. at one point she bit my hand. eventually i her breathing again and the paramedics, administered a defibrillator, and took her to the hospital. her daughter, who was there when this all happened and was too hysterical to call an ambulance, got my number on the scene before they left for the hospital. i received a message two weeks later saying that her mum was recovering from a cardiac arrest and that she couldnt thank me enough for saving her life.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	ever? i don't know about that, but a couple of years ago, i had an insanely delayed flight into columbus, oh -- weather was screwy, so my flight into dayton was cancelled (i had meetings in cin and dayton, but was going to spend the night in cincinnati). anyway, got into cmh around 1, managed to find a rental car, and saw this young couple trying to get \*themselves\* to dayton. i offered them a ride. now, it probably only added 45 minutes to an hour or so to my drive-time to go via dayton rather than direct to cin, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but the hour was pretty damned late. could have easily said no without much guilt, but did so anyway. fortunately, ohio has civilized alcohol laws so the hotel was able to sell me a couple of beers when i arrived at 3:30am.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	my girlfriend in high school and i had a bad falling out. she was the one who officially ended it, while i was trying to work things out. after the break up, the first class we had the next day was with each other. i sat behind her, and one of her friends normally sat to the left of her. in my table group i had four or five of my really good friends. i was happy to joke around with them and take my mind off of her- who i still felt upset with and kinda humiliated by after the dump (it was my first time on the dumped end of things). anyway, my then exs friend who usually sat by her called in sick that day. after my third or fourth glance her way i noticed when that she had clearly been crying earlier in the day, and seeing her alone like that just sucked. i thought that would have made me happy, you know? in some sort of pay-back type of way. seeing the person who hurt you get whats coming to them, and all that. but seeing her like that just tore me apart. so i went to the back of the class and asked a mutual friend of ours to move up front and sit by her. i didnt say why, not many people knew we had broken up at that point. i hated myself about 2 minutes later when i had to hear her laugh and joke with my friend the rest of class, but it was definitely better than seeing her suffer alone. tldr; got dumped by my high school gf, saw her upset and alone the next day in class together, asked a mutual friend to sit by her and cheer her up even after getting dumped.

[CLS]	what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	[SEP]	i was waiting for a cab to go home from work and that day was a pretty busy one. the cab rushed into the parking lot and picked me up. inside was an elderly lady waiting to go to the bank. by the time we pulled up to the bank, it was already closed (we were 3 minutes late) and the cab driver tried to tell her to call the dispatcher for another ride and she would have to wait a good 45 minutes. in the rain. i asked the cab driver to talk to the dispatcher about letting her just ride along until they have a chance to bring her home. they got all nasty and said she owed them $32 then for a round trip. she was worried because she didn't have the money since she didn't make it to the bank, so i paid for her ride. she was very kind and i felt that if i didn't get picked up, they could've made it. i know my little story isn't as heart warming as others. but i felt like this was just a nice story to share since a lot of people say my generation/age group are all shit heads.

[SEP]	"this has actually happened twice in my life. the first time, i was on a flight around age 19, and the woman next to me started having a panic attack as we were taking off. i grabbed her hand and just started talking about cool things to do in florida (where the destination was) as she hyper-ventilated and started crying. i thought maybe i was making her uncomfortable or not helping, so i stopped talking and released my grip on her hand. she squeezed super hard and started tapping our hands on the armrest, so then i told some funny stories from high school. about twenty minutes later, she started to calm down. she told me she was so thankful for me being her 'flight buddy', and that she suffers from anxiety and it was the first time she had been in a plane, and that my rambling had distracted her enough to keep her focused on something because she usually ends up fainting multiple times during panic attacks. she had another one during descent but not nearly as bad. gave me a huge hug afterwards and called me an angel in disguise. second time happened earlier this year in february. similar story, woman sitting next to me got ultra scared but this time it was during some pretty intense turbulence. not a full-on panic attack, but she grabbed my hand and said ""i'm so sorry, i don't mean to be weird but i really don't like this (meaning the turbulence)."" i said no worries! gave her my earbud and we watched chopped together on my phone for the rest of the flight."

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	"do i have to pick just one thing? **high school:** i had a good job where i could work 40 hours a week and go to school, so i had a stupid amount of money and parents who for some reason didn't pay any attention to what i was doing with it. as a senior, i was dating a sophomore, and her mom told her ""it's not your prom, so i'm not paying for a dress and everything."" i ended up spending well over $1,500 on dress, and hair, and makeup, and shoes, and manicure, and a photoshoot, and a custom made blue topaz pendant with a massive stone i hand-picked to perfectly match the dress she would be wearing. last time i saw that stone it was on a chain around her best friend's neck after we broke up. **college:** girlfriend of several months called me up and was sobbing incoherently. all i could make out between the gulps of breath and wailing was ""died."" her grandmother was not well, and she and i would go visit her from time to time so i assumed it was her grandmother that died. i threw my xbox controller mid-game at my roommate, leapt to my feet and said ""hey man, i have to go!"" once i arrived at her apartment and calmed her down i managed to ascertain that it was not her grandmother who had died, but her goldfish. she said she wanted to have a funeral for her fish. i was.annoyed.but determined to compassionately help her cope because obviously that goldfish mattered to her. i recommended she go get cleaned up and take a hot shower to relax, and while she was in there i called up a couple of my friends, and some of her girlfriends. i had a buddy of mine go to the park at the small campus lake and dig a fish grave, i had her girlfriends take her out to lunch, then i got the floating carcass out of the bowl, wrapped it in toilet paper, and placed it in a jewelry box coffin. we went and had a full fish funeral with music and people speaking and psalm 23 by the lake. afterward, when we were back at her apartment, she said ""i don't know why you did that, we should've just flushed it."" we broke up a few weeks later. tl;dr: i was an idiot who made underappreciated grand gestures edit: my first silver! thanks kind stranger! i'll use it to buy a life insurance policy on my kid's first goldfish! edit 2: my wife is going to be thrilled that my first reddit gold was a story about ex girlfriends. now i have to go figure out how gold works, lol. edit 3: there's some vitriol in the comments toward the bereaved fish owner. this was 15 years ago, most of us are cringy and foolish at times when we're younger. she's a perfectly delightful person, just not the person for me. be kind.

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	in high school this girl who i was close friends with (but also had a not so secret crush on) told me once how she really loved those huge 7 foot tall teddy bears, so i told her one day i'd buy her one and she laughed, writing it off as a joke. fast forward like 3 years later when we're going to the same local college and reconnected after slowly drifting apart after high school. she tells me one day that she's sick so i do the only logical thing. drive to costco after class, drop 200 bucks on that huge teddy bear, stuff it into the backseat of my tiny honda civic, drive incredibly dangerously since the bear is taking up my entire rear window, then show up at her front door. she says it feels too weird and romantic given our past (me having that not so secret crush back in high school and her having to tell me multiple times that we're better off as friends) so i do the whole drive back and return the bear.

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	i met a girl and fell head-over-heels for her. she lived in another state, nevertheless, we started a long distance relationship. coincidentally, she had just lost her job, so i sent her money every week. (almost my entire check) and i drove out to see her every chance i got. that autumn i found out she had a boyfriend and was just using me to pay her rent. i was at work when i found out and just left. i had to confront her about deceiving me. i drove 3 hours to her house and by the time i got there, i knew it didnt matter. she wasnt the person i thought she was. i gave her everything i had for nothing in return. instead of being mad or saying something that would win her back i told her that she a horrible person for lying to me; that i hope someday someone hurts her as much as she did me. the next day i went back to my job to see if i could get my last paycheck. my boss took me into his office and laid into me about being irresponsible and failing the company while i was sitting there, i could barely hear him as all i could think about was how stupid i was and suddenly, i started crying. i mean torrents of tears, ugly cry. i must have bawled for a good ten minutes. my boss stopped berating me and silently waited for me to get control of myself. then, in a very sympathetic tone, he told me its ok. i was in love like that once. we all do stupid things in the name of love. try to learn from this. it may seem like the world is ending but its not. youll be ok. then he sent me back to work stating that we never have to talk about it again. (he was a good boss and a great guy.) edit: a word edit2: wow! my first gold! thank you kind strangers!!! im really surprised by the responses. thanks for the encouragement and kindness. and to those of you who share similar experiences - i hope you have learned, as i have, that you are not alone. if your heart was broken, it will heal. to quote a friend - youll be ok i will try to answer some questions here. * this happened almost 30 years ago. * i had just graduated from high school. * she was older than me by several years. * we met through a friend i worked with. he found out what she was doing and told me at work. (probably not good timing!) i freaked and just walked out. * when i went back to work the next day, i was just planning to ask if i could be paid for the hours that i had completed that week. * this was back before direct deposit was a thing. * i no longer work at the company (the boss eventually retired and sold it.) * i gave her money because i was young and stupid. * she weaved tales of woe and i was all too happy to be the hero and save her. * i sent the money via western union (fun fact: if you send a lot of money through wu they will automatically make you a gold member so i got that goin' for me, which is nice.) * there were a lot of red flags that i ignored. the most glaring was that she lied. she lied to everyone. and here was my dumb ass thinking she wouldnt lie to me * it was my first time being in love. i had girlfriends in high school, but i had never felt like i was in love with them. so i had no idea that someone could use that against me. * my boss ended up being like a father-figure to me. gave me a lot of advice and guidance. * i am now married to the love of my life. * i am now a manager and i try to emulate some of my former boss great qualities with the people who work for me.

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	"i was so completely obsessed with a girl that i disregarded my own well being and threw away any chance i had for success. we dated for 4 years while we were in school for architecture. towards the end of our degrees, she started having trouble with her thesis project and asked for help. in what can only be described as a lengthy period of insanity, i decided to stop working on my own projects and focus entirely on her thesis. i did everything for her - designs, drawings, models, and write-ups. her presentation went flawlessly and she had the top grades in her class. as a result of staying up all night for weeks at a time and repeatedly delaying my own work, i failed most of my classes and dropped out of school. she was grateful, and begged me to help her work on her masters degree as well. no problem! got her straight a's and a brand new diploma to add to her collection. she dumped me on graduation day and immediately began a relationship with someone who understood the importance of self-respect. i'm not even mad - it was entirely my own doing, and i learned some valuable lessons. really expensive fuck up though. cost me about 8 years of my life playing catch-up. &#x200b; never put a school relationship before your own success. &#x200b; **edit: for those of you interested in a followup, here is what happened right after that shit show.** &#x200b; after i failed out of school, i tried to re-apply to my architecture program the following year. i got a letter in the mail letting me know that my student loans were in default, and i was ineligible for any financial aid. the news was soul crushing, and i really expected that my life was over. that's when i seriously considered suicide as a way out. &#x200b; in the end, i spent about a year in a complete haze, unable to function properly, not eating and rarely leaving my bed. i ran out savings, lost my apartment and had to move back into my parents house. the turning point for me was when i started speaking openly and honestly with my friends about what i was going through, and i credit them with pushing me in the right direction. i started researching suicide and how to combat negative thoughts, and ultimately came to the conclusion that life is something i want to experience - something interesting might happen eventually, even if things suck right now. &#x200b; to move forward, i embraced the fact that i was at rock bottom and convinced myself that there was nothing more i could lose. while my past self was afraid of failure, the new me said ""fuck it, let's do this."" my mission in life became getting back into school, no matter the cost. so i applied to any job i could, and was fortunate to be accepted at a landscape design company that needed a draftsman. after four years, working 9 hours a day at $12-$16 an hour, i had managed to make enough consecutive payments on my old school loans that they were deemed ""rehabilitated."" please keep in mind that during this time, i was able to live rent free and had minimal payments to bear, so i was extremely fortunate during that time. &#x200b; the last step was signing up for classes at my old school and taking out new federal loans. going back to school as an adult while working full time is tough, but at the same time i feel there's no better way to do it. i had a new appreciation my education, crushed my classes and graduated within 2 years - i even managed to bring my grades up from a 2.7 to a 3.2 gpa. &#x200b; so, that's the basic version of what happened. there's a ton of details i'm leaving out, like but covers most of it. if anyone is going through something similar, just hang in there. there are ways to fix almost any issue if you make the difficult choice to work towards a solution. start small and don't get overwhelmed if you are years away from reaching your goals. time will help heal your pain and you will learn lessons along the way."

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	bought her everything and trusted her. i had an ex that constantly made me feel like her life was falling apart no matter how much she tried to get ahead. she would ask for things like cars usually cheap ones so i didn't mind. well 3 cars later the amount was piling up. after the cars i was helping her pay rent because she would tell me someone stole from her or something like that. she never could keep a job and i'd believe her when she would say all the bosses were jerks or sexually harassing her so she was quitting. after a point i was paying for her cable bill while working an average of 65 hours a week to cover everything. she drove a decent mitsubishi eclipse while i drove a run down neon. i trusted everything she said and while i was working every hour i wasn't sleeping she was having sex with every guy she could so they could provide for her as well. i never knew because i didn't listen to anyone who said anything. when she got with my one close friend behind my back i managed to see who she was and we went separate ways. edit: so this got a fair bit of attention. to answer some question i only bought her cheap cars like $500 or less projects or beaters but i got them all running for her. the nice eclipse she had she got using money from her mother and such. as well you all are right to say i was an idiot i was but things are getting better and i don't talk to her anymore. edit 2: silver thank you anonymous redditor finally got something decent from that relationship	[SEP]	904

[SEP]	i've posted this before but still funny to me. dating a gymnast in high school. we go to a park and i see parallel bars that are designed for stretching but i'm convinced i can do a handstand on them because i'm awesome. she keeps insisting they are too far apart but i don't listen. attempt said handstand, they were indeed too far apart so i collapse down jamming my chest past my hands and strain/tear all the ligaments holding my chest muscles to my breastbone. good times were not had later or for a long while after.

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	i've told this story before, but when i was about 8 years old we took a field trip to the field museum here in chicago. during our lunch break i decided to wander off to the gift shop and see what they had. i had a huge crush on this girl named victoria in my class and i saw this lady bug ring for a couple of dollars. i knew she liked lady bugs and i had money my parents gave me to buy something at the shop, so i decided to buy the ring and give it to her. i was really nervous and kept waiting for the right time to do it. i eventually decided to just go for it and walked up to her near the end of the trip. she was with some of her friends which made me more nervous, but i found the courage to do it. she looked at the ring and laughed. her friends joined her and she then tossed the ring in the trash. i was completely devastated and tried hard to hold back my tears. even though i'm over it now, that completely fucked my confidence with girls for a long time. looking back, i may have embarassed her too giving it to her in front of her friends, which is why she reacted that way, but whatever the case, it's probably the most embarassed i have been in my life.

[SEP]	i'm female, hope this counts. first girlfriend, first serious relationship. she kept saying how much fun it would be to have a dog together and i'm a huge pushover so we did. we couldn't agree on dogs because she had bad taste and didn't trust my judgement. finally i gave in and accepted the next dog she brought up. 65 pound pitbull mix. insane! i wanted to get rid of him but knew no one else would adopt him. he had severe behavioral issues, crippling separation anxiety, and endless energy. my girlfriend walked him once for 10 minutes, then handed me the leash and never walked him again. aside from occasionally feeding and watering him i did all the work. i had emotional breakdowns due to the stress of loving this dog and feeling like nothing i did helped. 2 hours of a walks a day at least, training, grooming, vet appointments, nail trims, hikes, socializing with other dogs, going to pet friendly businesses. i was in college and working. i have no idea how i took care of him and rehabilitated that dog into the well-mannered friend he is today. she and i broke up. darwin (the dog) and i are still together living out our happily ever after. stupidest thing i did for a girl, best thing i did for me (and darwin).

[CLS]	guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	[SEP]	"might not be something too insane or extreme,but: this happened in 2018's st. valentine: at my high school, between every hour, we get a 10 minutes pause and a 20 minutes one ( basically lunch break ). at the time it was really cold and snowy, with the snow being near 1 meter and a half high. through the class' windows you could see the ""violent"" snowstorm easily ( in my country the weather is pretty messed up ). i had a crush on a girl ( and i probably still do ) that's in my classroom, and since high school has started i've been planning to express my feelings about her, i just didn't know how. so, in that day, i decided to go through the snowstorm and buy one rose and wait for her in class as i knew that she wasn't there ( she usually goes out on every pause, especially on the 20 mins one ). those 15-20 minutes felt like more than 30; i had to find my way through the snow to the flower shop. i finally did it: i bought that rose, the biggest and the most beautiful one that was there. i got in class, waited for her with an insane anxiety ( as everyone, almost, in the class, after understanding to who the flower was ment to be given, was cheering on me). she comes, i start walking towards her, with the insane anxiety still hanging there, and i give her the rose, in a pretty ""common"" way, but still elegant. i ask her out to watch a movie together, she says that she will ""probably"" come, but i felt incredibly better and relieved. what happened? she kept postponing our date and we never ended up going out together. i literally prepared myself like 4 times ( 4 different fridays ) both physically ( clothing ) and mentally. she said to me, through someone i know, that she rejected me because of the bullies in my class, as half of the class started making fun of me bringing that flower to her, and that she ""would have liked"" to go out on a date with me. obviously, she didn't."

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	"psychiatrist here. a 30 year old man with mild depressive symptoms was in-and-out of the hospital fairly quickly. he was under pressure from his home life, living with 4 roommates who were making life a bit difficult for him. no suicidal thoughts. he was cleared of all psychopathologies by me and two other doctors. a few months later he came back. same symptoms, however this time he talked about 5 roommates. it felt wrong, and i digged in his story. tried to contact his roommates. he lived alone and was severely psychotic. i have no idea to this day how he hid it so well from everyone. edit: a few more details: the patient talked, dressed and acted normally however after admitting him for a longer period we noticed he talked with his ""roommates"" often. he was single, no contact with his family and somehow working, however in a routine job with little to no personal contact. after a few talks he also claimed other peoples thoughts were sometimes ""thrown at him and sitting on his head"", and he could thus read people's minds against his will. the interesting thing about this patient was, that his internal world somehow fitted the external world when asked - his roommates sounded perfectly plausible (they were not e.g. shadow-people, vikings, 12 m tall) and they teased him by hiding his stuff. but he ate with them, watched tv with them, so on. normally a person with paranoid schizophrenia (paranoid meaning all types of delusions) will have multiple symptoms sometimes easy to see for the untrained eye. the patients can dress, talk and present themselves in odd ways, usually different from cultural norms. they can have incoherent speech, make up words and phrases or are clearly separated from reality (another patient of mine insisted that i was in jail for medicating him, even when we talked). when we quickly ""scan"" a patient for psychotic symptoms we basically look for inconsistencies in the patients experience of the world - the patients normally know ""something is wrong"" or ""weird"" or ""different"", but often belive it is the world around them, that have changed. this is due to discrepancy between what they experience (input), failed assessment of the inputs (due to the thinking disorder) and testing hypothesis based on failed assessments which collide with the real world. this will activate defense mechanisms fx denial, wild explanations, accepting both ""realities"" at the same time, and so on. (e.g ""i am not sick, my doctor must be a bad guy, bad guys are in jail, my doctor are in jail, but my doctor is sitting right in front of me at the same time, he must have an identical twin or this is an alternate reality). this is usually the way delusions are made. to summarize: when we scan for psychosis, we look for inconsistencies between the patients subjective experience of thinking, being and acting and the objective reality accepted by the generel cultural norm. this patient managed to live in a subjective psychotic world that just fitted so well with the objective reality that he tricked several psychiatrists including myself."

[SEP]	i've had a couple of gems, but the one that really sticks out in my mind actually happened about a month or so ago. a young mother brought in a 6 year old to emerg, she was super nice, and apologetic because she thought that she was wasting my time, because she said that her son had started to develop different spots all over his body and she has no idea why. my initial first thought was chicken pox, so i had some swords and shields up ready to go for the anti-vax debate, but she claimed that she had her son vaccinated at all stages up to that point, and upon closer inspection they were mass of clusters of warts. not uncommon, but because of how rapidly that they were growing, i ordered some blood work to make sure there wasn't an underlying cause as kids immune systems are pretty well equipped to handle that sort of thing. and i'm really glad that she brought him in, because he had a severely low white blood cell count which revealed a primary immune deficiency disease.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	"bit of a weird one, because the request for a second opinion came from an intensivist and i was a contributor to their treatment plan. i work in poisons control. had a call from a green, but very astute young doctor with a middle-aged female patient presenting with a vague 36-48hr history of malaise, confusion, hypoxia from hyperventilation, and hallucinations. on workup was noted to have pulmonary edema (lung fluid buildup), metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, sinus tachy and raised crp & wcc, suggestive of infection but no temperature. the initial diagnosis was sepsis. this keen-eyed doctor, pretty fresh out of med school, decided to do a salicylate level on this lady because the hyperventilation paired with metabolic acidosis and aki was enough to prompt her suspicions of aspirin poisoning, even though they could just as easily be explained by sepsis as well. the level came back high. not huge, but high, which prompted her to phone me for a second opinion on how relevant the finding was in terms of the patient's clinical picture. simultaneously, the patient's family investigated the property and located numerous aspirin blister packs suggesting she had been dosing herself for chronic pain, which was present in the medical history. chronic salicylate poisoning is insidious and has been referred to as a ""pseudosepsis"" in the medical literature as it often causes similar features. comparing a high level in chronic poisoning to the same level in acute poisoning, features are much more severe in chronic poisoning (i.e. pulmonary edema, hypoxia, aki etc) - there is a disparity. we recommended certain treatments (all hail sodium bicarbonate) and the patient made a full recovery after a 2 week hospital stay. whilst there was no question an infective cause was present and contributory, i was impressed with the green doctor's intuition and willingness to consider other causes - i feel like it greatly improved the patient's treatment. edit: some words."

[SEP]	a bit of background: in my field of audiology we have people licensed to diagnose not only hearing issues but balance disorders and other factors impacting listening and understanding. we also have another field who popped up when it was not considered as ethical for us to *treat* those more serious hearing issues (i.e. with hearing aids) but they dont need the same doctorate level training, just barely high school or some college depending on jurisdiction. so i had a patient come in with a serious difference between left and right hearing and this in itself is considered a red flag because both ears are exposed to the same things over time. and there are very few explanations as to why one would get so bad. the patient could hardly understand words on that bad side and the better ear was pretty good overall, just minor hearing loss perhaps age-related. immediately upon seeing these test results, the ent and i agreed to send this patient for an mri of the head because something was off. the patient confirmed no mri or medical treatment had been recommended in the past and only hearing aids by this lesser-trained hearing aid dealer (working for a popular u.s. chain). the patient had been wearing these hearing aids already for a few years. the mri results came back. massive tumor on the hearing nerve. the hearing aid dealer is being investigated currently for malpractice (or more specifically a violation of state laws regarding red flags). edit: since a few of you are asking what happened with the patient, ill paste what got buried below. i dont usually get to see these cases if they get sent for surgery. im not in a big metro area so the very specialized ents (neurotologists) have their own audiologists to handle post-op testing. anticlimactic, i agree	[SEP]	6215

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	at one of my practica placements, i conduct psychological evaluations for children and adults referred by the court system, typically following court-mandated removal. the referrals almost always ask for differential diagnoses and treatment recommendations. many of the children have previous psychiatric diagnoses and are prescribed a slew of medications. in this sense, the psychological evaluation is a comprehensive second opinion that requires me to sort through previous diagnoses, background information, and data from the assessments i administer. i would say that the most common misdiagnoses that i see among children are bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). often times when a child has a traumatic history (as many of my clients do), they exhibit signs of hypervigilance, avoidance, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral issues. the hypervigilence looks like the hyperactivity found in adhd and the hypomania/mania in bipolar disorder. emotional dysregulation and avoidance (e.g., social withdrawal) is easily mistaken for the depressive side of bipolar disorder and can also result in disruptive behaviors characteristic of adhd. there are also some serious repercussions of prescribing children psychotropic medications to treat psychiatric disorders they do not have. to answer the question directly, its rewarding when you have the opportunity to help clarify a childs psychiatric diagnosis and ideally write treatment recommendations that improve their prognosis. im a fan of comprehensive second opinions, especially in the arena of mental health.

is it because she wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for air (classic sign of uncontrolled asthma). they're like yes, how did you know?. sleeping meds prob among worst things she could have gotten and almost killed the patient by saying she could fly. people who get diagnosed with ""bronchitis"" when they have heart failure and literally drowning in fluid. there are doctors who give antibiotics and steroids for everything esp when they have no idea what's going on. maybe i'm biased because i work at an academic center so i see all the cases who get referred in because they're too sick or no one can figure out but at least a few times a week i'm like wow this person could have been saved or not end up this way if someone cared enough earlier on. i'm going to say this as a doctor. it's honestly scary every day how many patients i see are completely mismanaged. some doctors in urgent care see like 45 patients in a day. how is that possible to be thorough??? like if only patients knew what the doctors missed or what not.half the time i really think it's like going to an bad auto shop and not realizing they're just making half the shit up. same thing happens in medicine and except people's lives suffer because of it. edit-added a story. thank you to whoever gave me silver/gold. let me say something.people are saying i'm gregory house or something. i'm not. i purposely didn't choose stories that were some esoteric diagnoses. everything i picked is like bread and butter medical student level. half of being a good doctor is knowing what questions to ask. sometimes you don't even know what's important or not. the other half is caring. too many just put a band-aid on the problem and punt the patient to someone else. is it the doctors fault? i don't know but i do know the medical system in the us provides no incentives for doctors to actually practice good medicine. in fact, i bring in less money if i'm thorough versus i do the same thing every patient and see 100 patients a day (which is what some do unfortunately). i have tons more stories, hopefully i'll get to share some more but for now have to sleep (was on call overnight). &#x200b; edit x2: thank you again for all the gilds! i don't even know what they all do or mean but i'm very grateful nonetheless. few more things i wanted to say - there are plenty of amazing doctors out there, not all are bad. we all put our lives on hold for ten years for altruistic purposes. not everyone just wants to make a quick buck so i hope i didn't characterize it as such. i tried to respond to some comments but i don't have time to respond to all. a lot asked - ""so how do i find a good doctor?"" the answer is.i don't know. i've tried looking for good ones myself and it's hard. i joke you should find the doctors all the other doctors go to because i have a higher ""bs"" meter when i meet a bad one. doctor rating websites are garbage. i've seen doctors get great ""ratings"" because they just hand out opioids/benzodiazepines to everyone even if all his or her patients become addicted later. a lot of it is really your gut feeling. a good one should listen to you and most importantly, sometimes be confident enough to say ""i don't know but i'll look it up or send you to someone who does know."" the scariest ones are those who don't even realize what they don't know. and the most perplexing thing to me.if you don't like an auto mechanic or realtor, you would find another right?

[SEP]	"as an ophthalmologist, i've seen quite a few misses unfortunately. the eye is just not very well studied outside of this field so many doctors do not feel comfortable with the eye which is understandable. there was one case of a small child who had a minor trauma to the eye. the er called and stated that everything looked fine and she was most likely ready to go home but would prefer if we came down to take a look. got down there, examined her and she had an open globe (eyeball was ruptured meaning there is actually a hole in the eye that needs to be closed surgically). was very glad we got that call. another time a patient came in to the er complaining of complete loss of vision. upon exam his vision was light perception only in both eyes. this means that the patient cannot even see a hand waving 2 inches from their face but they can still make out light vs dark. he stated he had went to the er 2 months ago when his vision first started deteriorating but was told he had ""conjunctivitis"" and given antibiotics ointment. he did not return to the er for 2 months because he did not have insurance and was homeless at the time. my alarm bells were already ringing at this point. i did an exam to look at the retina and saw numerous white plaques which is a sign of inflammation with infection being the most concerning. the patient ended up having syphilis that had gone into his eye and made him blind. unfortunately, at this point his prognosis for recovering vision was poor even with treatment. this next one was not really a miss but more of a delayed diagnosis. a patient came to the er 1 month after a gunshot wound to the head. did surprisingly well since the bullet missed most of the important structures in the brain. he was back in the er as the swelling on his eye had not gotten better. it's common after a big trauma like that for the eye to be swollen for 1 to 2 weeks before getting better. he also was complaining of double vision. on exam his eye was swollen and being pushed forward out of orbit and he could not move his eye to the left. given his history i was worried he developed something called an artery venous fistula which is where an artery and a vein combine causing the high pressure in the artery to enter the vein and build up a back pressure causing the vein to engorge because it can no longer drain blood. got a ct scan to confirm. patient went to surgery the next day. i do caution the general public to be weary of this thread though. it is unfair to doctors look at this thread and claim incompetence. diseases usually develop on a continuum age and one doctor might catch it at a later date because it has had more time to present itself. there is also a stepwise approach to medicine. if you gave everyone with a headache a ct scan there would be more harm then good. it's possible that when a person gets a second opinion they see the first doctor already ruled a lot of things out so they are in a better position to diagnose, whereas if you had stayed with the original doctor and continued to work with him he may have gotten to the diagnosis as well. as a patient it can be frustrating but be mindful that most doctors do want what's best for you and there may be a lot of things going on in the background you are unaware of. for example when patients come in for cold symptoms, they assess usually frustrated when they are told there is no treatment needed. they feel like it is a waste of a trip. but that doctor used his medical knowledge to 1. reassure you 2. avoid harmful if unneeded antibiotics 3. made sure you didn't actually have a diagnosis that requires emergent treatment"	[SEP]	746

[SEP]	10 days ago i saw a 22 year old patient, a pakistani foreign student. he had gone to another hospital some days before for aspecific neck pain, they gave him ibuprophen and sent him home. nothing had changed so he came to the hospital where i work. he had low and persistent fever (refused paracetamol because of ramadan) and swollen lymph nodes in his neck and clavicle. sent him for a chest x-ray which showed a very suspicious mediastinic mass. he then had a cat scan with contrast, that mass was enlarged lymph nodes as well. we contacted the hematology specialist and booked an appointment for the next day, it all suggests a lymphoma. now, to be honest, i m not even sure i made a difference in this guy's life because it seemed advanced but at least i pointed him to the right direction.

[SEP]	not a doctor, and this isn't about a human. on new year's day, 2 years ago, our little hound dog would not get out of bed. her back half was unresponsive, and she would yelp in pain if anyone touched her. we took her to the emergency vet, the only place open to get care on january 1. we were there for 6 hours. the place was a mad house. eventually, doc checks out our pupper. they take a bunch of x-rays, and the doctor tells us that there are no breaks, which means there are likely lesions on puppy's spinal cord, and our options are either very pricey surgery and a significant quality of life decrease, or put her down and save her the pain. they give us some pain meds for her, and we take her home to think about the options. the next day, we get in to our regular vet's office. dog is still limping and heavily favoring a leg. regular doc inspects poochie and asks what other doc said. after hearing er doc's prognosis, regular doc advises us never to go back, and informs us that our dog likely banged her knee really hard on the bricks of our porch and was just being a baby about it. two days later, doggo is 100% fine.

[SEP]	this actually happened a few weeks ago. my sister went to urgent care because she had a bad cough and was having trouble breathing - they said it was a virus and gave her antibiotics my mom took her to her primary dr who confirmed it. 10 days later she wasnt better so my mom took her back and insisted she get an x ray. the doctor said, i dont know why you brought her back in - its just a cough. turns out entire right lung was collapsed, which showed on the x ray. it had been for almost two weeks. the doctor called us and said you need to go to the er right now. and then began an emergency surgery in the er, admittance to the hospital for a week, and another surgery two days later edit to add: checked with my mom, sister was prescribed the antibiotic clarithromycin. and confirmed that they did say virus originally it was a really horrible experience overall - from the urgent care to the primary doctor. at the er (and then the hospital when she was admitted) it was a bit better. she had an emergency surgery in the er where the doctor put a tube in her through her back to inflate the lung and another to remove excess liquid from her lung. so for the rest of her time there she had the tube connected from her back to a big plastic clear briefcase looking thing that filtered blood and liquid out of her lung. her second surgery was bc her lung wouldnt inflate back up bc - surprise! - she had a big leak in her lung they needed to repair she was kind of hilarious bc while on morphine she kept dropping f bombs (where is the fucking nurse with my food) but she doesnt remember anything from the hospital anymore she has down syndrome and the cause of the collapsed lung was actually because at the special olympics her team of petite women played against 60+ tall men w tattoos. (dont even get me started on how stupid the special olympics can be, with literal ringers used to win gold in the lowest division.) a man chest bumped her and fell on top of her and we think thats what caused it. shes predisposed to these kinds of things bc of her down syndrome - and had open heart surgery at 2 for a hole in her heart anyway, shes a champ. heading back to work today unhappily, but excited because shes been cleared to go to a special needs prom next friday 	[SEP]	1511

[SEP]	"i am a doctor (primary care with some emergency), and can't really think of any good examples of this right now. it's definitely happened, but never in a way that i end up holding it against the other doctor involved. you kind of end up too busy doing your job. one phrase that i find myself repeating to patients is ""i don't really understand what \[previous doctor\] was thinking here, but the way that the guidelines/my experience has taught me to approach this problem is \[hopefully correct solution\]"" most of the time, the fact that the patient has gone looking for a second opinion or another consult tells you about their level of concern and changes your management. doctor #1 might see a patient with 2 days of low abdo pain and (correctly) reassure the patient that it's probably nothing and come back in a week if symptoms continue. patient then goes to doctor #2 a couple of days later, more worried and cheesed off at #1. with the increased level of concern, #2 then orders an ultrasound that reveals ovarian cancer. the issue here is that both doctors are correct. the next abdominal pain that comes in to see either doctor at 2 days of symptoms will still receive reassurance as their primary treatment, because it will most likely be something simple like constipation or cramping. giving every patient with simple symptoms an ultrasound is not economically feasible. i would hope that any diagnoses i've missed or mismanaged (and i assume there's been a few) were picked up by another doctor and that they also gave me the benefit of the doubt.

[SEP]	not a doctor, but a paramedic, so hopefully i wont be laughed out of the comments section for this. about a year ago, i got called to a 15 y/o male whod collapsed in the parking lot of his residential apartment complex. as a 911 service, we get called to a lot of situations that might seem emergent to people going about their daily business, but appear relatively routine or mundane to us in terms of acuity; additionally, because it was 15 min before shift change, and 15 year olds rarely collapse from spontaneous cardiac arrest, i was fully prepared to call bs on this before we arrived on scene. turns out the kid was, indeed, in total arrest, and we took over from the bystanders who initiated compressions and went into full code mode. our standards of care mandate that we work a code for up to 40 minutes, depending on patient presentation, before we call a doc for termination of resuscitative efforts, and so we worked this kid for 40 minutes in the parking lot and still had no return of pulses. at this point, and i still have no idea whether my decision was based in emotion, clinical observation, or just a gut feeling, i elected to transport a working cardiac arrest (something we rarely do) rather than call for tor. got to the ed (level 2 trauma, cath lab, primary stroke, great facility), wheel the kid with ongoing compressions and interventions into the room, and the ed doc (in my experience, a fantastic doctor) takes a look at the patient, feels for a pulse, and says [this patient] is gone and gets ready to call it. then he looks at me, and im pretty shattered at this point, and says hell do an ultrasound to demonstrate. conducts the ultrasound, and lo and behold, the kids heart is beating: weakly, but beating. kid gets transferred to pedi icu, wakes up within the week, and attended a survivors dinner 2 months ago where i tried not to cry excessively in front of him. overconfidence and an inability to share perspective/clinical opinions are a dangerous path to navigate in the medical profession. i was enormously lucky, as was this patient, to have multiple trained providers in this case, and if the doc hadnt performed the ultra. well, this story would be a much sadder one.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	heard this from an ultrasound tech, a man came in severely injured after a car accident. the man had a laceration above his right thigh along with a puncture wound from his door or something from the car, can't remember. the doctor ordered an ultrasound of this mans leg in order to make sure the vein had not been punctured. the guy was doped up on painkillers by the time he had gotten to the tech, so he was loopey as hell while she was performing the scan. she felt something metallic against his arm when she was positioning his thigh to get a full scan. she asked him if his leg had another puncture wound on the inside of his thigh. he told her no, he just has a massive piercing on his penis, like a fucking bull horn or some shit. she asked him to position his privates away from her while she performed the rest of the scan. breaking hipaa laws, this tech told her husband (at home not at work) about this mans piercing, her husband was a mri tech at the same hospital. the next day, the same man was scheduled for an mri on his thigh. now mri's are magnetic resonance imaging, so its literally a fucking magnet that will fuck up piercings. because that ultra sound tech had broken hipaa laws, she actually had saved this mans dick. her husband warned him to remove all piercings from his body and made sure this man knew that he meant all piercings. not exactly a second opinion story but whatever.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	not a doctor but a lucky patient, during my last 4 days of boot camp, i woke up 2 hours before we were supposed to and i couldn't breathe, i was gagging and choking and it took about 2 minutes before i could again. everyone thought i was just malingering so that i'd get out of the last 4 days and relax until i went home. went to a doctor and they did basic tests, said it could be my allergies or something (suuuper allergic to pollen but not this bad) and i was sent back to the barracks. my trouble with breathing continues and i'm more sore than i have been since the first week or so. anyways, i go home (still live with my family) and and i was obviously tired and sore and wanted to be lazy for a bit, so when the first couple days i was sleeping for 16 hours a day my family just thought i was exhausted and needed rest. after 7 or so days of this they got tired of me being lazy and decided make me get up outa bed and do a bunch of house work, wash their cars just anything to keep me outa bed. i tell them i don't feel good and everything still hurts, my chest feels heavy and i need to get back in bed but they aren't having it. finally i convince them to let me see the doctor, but they just agree its muscle pains primarily, and that i need to keep using them to eventually make the soreness go away. eventually, going back to university, one of my professors notices i don't look to well, i explain my symptoms and tell him what's going on, (this was a math prof. not even medically trained just common sense) he suggests i get tested for mono, and lo and behold guess what i got? turns out, the people doing the health screening neglected several people, and the officers in charge of us said if ever out of water share canteens with the closest person to you. so no running to refill it or anything, this apparently spread mono throughout my battalion. when i got a doctor who confirmed this, they later find out my spleen was on the verge of rupturing, and if i had gone another few days or a week more, ~~it would have and i would have drowned internally~~ could have caused a life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. &#x200b; edit: drowning internally is not possible, this was likely an exaggeration from me trying to remember and retell the story over the years, maybe a mixup in my head or something. in actuality i would have just become really really sick, would have required surgery and shit but i wouldn't have drowned and died. apologies!

[SEP]	from the other side, patients mother who had to kick and scream for a second opinion. my daughter fell off the bed when she was 8 months old. i checked her over and nothing was obviously wrong, she cried for a couple of minutes and then seemed okay. but i noticed as the evening went on she wasnt crawling much, she would start and give a very angry yell, not a pain cry but straight pissed off and sit back up. she went to sleep like normal and i started worrying if i should have taken her to the doctor right away. my hubs says she seems all right, lets see how shes doing in the morning. as soon as i wake up i decide im going to get her checked out. shes still acting normal except for not crawling, but shes playing and babbling and i figure im probably overreacting but i cant stop worrying. im at the doctor as soon as he opens, he tells me i should have taken her to the er immediately after any kind of fall but doesnt think anything is wrong. he checks her arm, cant find swelling, shes not reacting to him manipulate her arm, he says shes fine. i ask if she can be x-rayed and he says its not necessary. i answer that i want to be certain. he tells me its overkill but if it makes me feel better then i should do it. he writes a note for the er and we head there. er doctor examines her and tells me shes fine and that x-rays can be upsetting for babies and he doesnt think she needs it. he tells me if she continues acting funny for a few days i can bring her back. i ask what would happen if something was wrong and i let it go untreated that long. he shrugs and says they can do the x-ray if it makes me feel better. there was a broken bone in her wrist. the doctor actually apologized to me and gave me props for pushing for the x-ray when i felt something was wrong. when it comes to my kids, id definitely rather be safe than sorry.

[SEP]	i currently work in neurosurgery (pa tho, not a doc). i just had a guy who came in for a routine consult after falling on his back and breaking two vertebrae. not a big deal as they are thoracic vertebrae and a stable fracture pattern. during physical exam he had some subtle, but weird findings. he reports entire left facial numbness with intermittent arm numbness which his pain doc has been writing off as cervical radiculopathy. he also had pronator drift, a finding that there is something compressive in the brain. i told him that the facial numbness and pronator drift is coming from the brain, not c-spine but to hold on, my surgeon needs to see him. while waiting for my surgeon to see him the guy, he got sick of waiting and left (surgeon was tied up for about 15 minutes discussing surgery with previous patient). he came in to our er a few days later and was seen by another one of our surgeons- stage 4 lung cancer with something like 15 brain mets.

[CLS]	doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	[SEP]	not a doc, but a second opinion likely saved my life a few years ago. its a long story, but hopefully it helps someone else not make the same mistakes i did. tl;dr: be your own advocate. if something feels off- it very well might be. id just switched to new health insurance and had picked my gp but hadnt been in to see her yet when i started getting sick. high fever, headache, fatigue, and back pain. i tried to rest it off but it was persistent so thought it best to see the doc just in case. i didnt have tons of time around work, so i popped into urgent care where they took a look and ran some x-rays and told me i had mild pneumonia. they prescribed some meds and told me to take it easy. i was 25 at the time and had unfortunately already experienced pneumonia and walking pneumonia in years prior. based on my previous experiences, i thought this was an odd diagnosis as i wasnt coughing at all. the last few times id had it i was hacking up a lung so to speak. but- i was busy and tired and trusted them so i went on my way. i took the meds, rested, stayed home, but i was still sick- getting worse. so i decided to make a proper appointment with a doc to get this really checked out because something felt wrong. unfortunately, my gps schedule was full for the next month+ so i saw the next available doc. well call her dr a. i went to see dr a about a week after urgent care. told her all my symptoms, how long itd been going on, etc. she told me it was regular old pneumonia and it was normal for my symptoms to get worse before they got better and that i should keep taking tylenol for the headaches and fever and monitor my temp (which was sitting at 100+ pretty much constantly). i told her id had pneumonia before and this felt different. she made me feel like a liar and an idiot for even suggesting she might not be right with my diagnosis. i left feeling bummed, angry and still very sick. a few days later, my fatigue was insane and i started to see these painful bright red bumps cropping up on my legs. id had hives before, and knew it wasnt that- no itching. im allergic to both sulfa and penicillin antibiotics so i was worried i was having a reaction to the ones they gave me. i went in to see dr a again. by then my legs were completely covered in huge raised pinkish red patches. plus i still had a fever, chills, back pain, fatigue and headache. when i arrived, she told me she didnt know what the red patches were. she brought in her student for a second opinion- he didnt know either. then she told me to go get blood drawn so she could run some tests. in the meantime, she told me to keep taking tylenol and monitor my fever. still treating me like a liar and an idiot. so i go down to get blood drawn which was excruciating. i was definitely dehydrated- they couldnt find a vein and tried both arms twice. id given blood many times before then and never cried, but after the fourth try i was almost sobbing. i had a 100+ fever at this point and told them to please just take it from the veins on my hand which they had refused because it hurt more. im like lady im already crying- just do it. they do it. no pain. i leave. i wait to hear from dr a with results. no word from her so i call. she says she didnt find anything and to keep monitoring. at this point i had been sick for weeks. im averaging 101 fever daily. ibuprofen isnt helping. i can barely walk. the red patches on my legs are spreading to my arms and torso. im so tired i can barely do anything and my back pain and headache are constant. im starting to notice breathing trouble- little bouts of too-fast breathing and my heart rate feels abnormally high. im miserable. i schedule a phone appointment with dr a because im too weak to go in. she misses it. that night, as im laying in bed with a 103+ fever that keeps going up, i start hyperventilating, or what feels like that. i cant catch my breath. i feel like i cant breathe. my heart rate is nuts. i know i need to go back to the hospital, i try to get up but i can barely stand. fun! so my boyfriend carries me down the stairs and around the corner to our car (apartment life!) and we head to urgent care (im poor and trying real hard to avoid er bills by that point). they see me immediately (yikes!) and after evaluating me and my chart for all of five minutes, this angel nurse brings in another doc who confirms that i need to go to the er now. angel nurse then proceeds to pop me in a wheelchair and personally wheel me to the er which was next door to avoid sitting me with ambulance bills, though its against their policy. once i get to the er im pumped wit fluids, given oxygen and am told my actual gp, who ive never met, will be in to see me very soon. several docs come by to take blood, evaluate, ask questions. they dont know what ive got but theyre going to figure it out. im so relieved! im admitted to the hospital and finally meet my actual gp in the morning. she is amazing and takes me seriously- asking questions and telling me what other departments shes looping in to help. she keeps popping back in to let me know where theyre at with a diagnosis. by late morning- shes figured it out: fungal pneumonia with a complication (the red splotches) erythema nodosum. the antibiotics id been given didnt do anything to help, which is why id been getting worse. everything worked out fine- i got the right meds and recovered. the red patches faded to bruises. but every time i think about that experience, i just wish i had been more insistent with dr a. i was so angry with her for not taking me seriously and not doing her job. her blas attitude towards my health, and my failure to push back, landed me in the freakin hospital. moral of the story: get a second opinion. and if your doc treats you like a liar- get a new one immediately. dont wait around and definitely dont see that doc again. edit: spelling!

""bam bam bam bam."" unloading into the car. he then turns, runs right back past me, and down the alley into the night. don't think he saw me at all. nothing really came of it. except my partner was convinced i was a ""marked man"" and refused to be near me for a year or so. edit: holy crap, i kind of expected this to get buried. this was los angeles. i was about 25 (almost 50 now) so some specifics are long gone - but i remember this: my buddy was genuinely terrified by this, i don't think he knew anything about it (in fact he seemed to interpret the event as a larger conspiracy to have me snuffed - not some random pissed off dude making a point/getting jumped in) and because he ditched the car/wouldn't take my calls it got left at that. for those concerned with the car - it was, like, a 1980's rusted out sedan.maybe a $500 car. details about the slugs/number of rounds fired were relayed to me later by third parties (my friend and i were known in the neighborhood, people were talking about it). thank you for the well wishes. honestly though, this wasn't even the first time i was shot at (it's been a long strange trip). edit 2: also, i tried to argue later that it's just as likely the guy was shooting at someone else across the street and that the car just got in the way. but there were holes all through that thing. back seat had 4/5, another 2/3 went into the back window and ended up in the backs of the front seats, another 2/3 rounds went right into the trunk. i honestly don't know if he was a terrible shot, or if he hit right what he was aiming for. apologies if i'm doing this wrong, i suck at reddit."

[SEP]	"when i was about 10 my grandfather was dying from complications of his heart issues and mentel deterioration. i didn't know him very well as the last time we had been in contact him was when i was a baby. my father never liked him and didn't bother coming with me and my mother to visit him in the hospital. when we got there he was resting peacefully and my mother went forward and whispered some words to him, i imagine about his current state of health. i hang back a little bit because the creepy old guy whome i didn't recall seeing in my whole life really freaked me out. regaurdless of my anxiety my mom said i should approach grandpa and share some nice words with him. i understood by how sad my mother was that i shouldn't argue too much so i approached his hospital bed to speak to him. he didnt seem concious at all so i just did what my mother did, leaning forward and just whisper some nice things to him. things took turn when mid sentence his eyes flair opon and he stares at me making me stop what im saying. my heart dropped into my ass when he looked at me because it was pure hatred in his eyes. as soon as we made eye contact he bolted upright from his bed and wrapped his hands around my neck and started throttling me as hard as he could. i barely even remember what happened but my mom was screaming for a nurse. and grandpa kept yelling at me while shaking my neck violently ""f*cking betrayal you betray me* and then he died. almost as fast as it began it was over. his grip loosened and he flat lined. my mother was inconsolable and i was extremely confused and crying out of sheer trauma at the situation. later after we managed to calm down a nurse explained to my mother that his severe dementia had left him barely coherent and it was likely he had thought i was someone else. i didn't learn this until several years later but my mother suspected my grandfather saw my father in me. my father was an alcoholic womanizor and fairly abusive in my earlier childhood and my grandfather resented him for it. i guess i look a little too much like my dad."

[SEP]	i have a friend who had a party at his parents house when he was in high school that a ton of random people went to. he got super drunk during the party and went upstairs to go to sleep, knowing that his friends would watch the party for him. my friend woke up from his nap to a guy from his school sitting on top of him stabbing him death. he was stabbed seven times before it stopped and he laid there on the bed dying. the only reason he is still alive is because his best friend came upstairs to ask him if it was alright if he made a frozen pizza and found him. the assailant was put in jail and recently was released and it scares me to know that a guy who wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone (said during the trial), is still out there free.

[SEP]	my dad has a client that owns a number of fast food restaurants. one day we were working at one of his stores (remodeling) and talking about robberies. the client told us that when he was just getting into the fast food business, he lived in colorado. he was assistant manager at a chain that required him to wear a tie. a drug addict came into the restaurant to rob them and grabbed him from behind, putting a knife to his throat. he opened the register and the guy attempted to slit his throat anyway, except the knife was dull and couldn't cut through the material of the tie. the client began to fight back and escaped with minor injuries. addict went to prison and apparently he has the tie in a frame at home.

[SEP]	our neighbours when i was growing up had three kids the same ages as myself and my siblings. we were all friends and got along well for the most part. their eldest child, i'll call him peter, has asperger syndrome and was known to have outbursts that would sometimes be violent. one day, when i was 5 or 6, our mothers decided to take all six of us to a nearby wading pool because it was hot out. well, due to that, it was pretty busy, and there were a lot of other kids. there were two lifeguards there, but were generally too busy chatting with each other to be doing their jobs (as my mother later tells me). i was off with my neighbour's daughter, was my age, and peter. i don't remember why, but he suddenly flew into a fit and decided that i was at fault for something. he, being about 8 and a lot bigger than me, grabs my head and holds it under the water. i remember that. i remember not being able to breath, i remember clearly thinking that i needed air or i was going to die. i remember fighting, but not being strong enough to get him off of me. then i remember my mom's face. she had a clear look of both terror and fury. i remember looking over and seeing peter sitting with his arms around his knees, rocking back and forth as his mother tried to calm him down. then i remember my mom absolutely losing it on the lifeguards who had missed everything and were clueless as to why this tiny woman was screaming at them that her daughter had almost drowned on their watch. to this day, i have a fear of swimming and absolutely do not like having water on my face, even when i'm showering.

[SEP]	"i was doing volunteer work in central america, working in a really bad area of the capitol city--it was a slum built on top of the city's garbage dump. the whole place reeked of trash, and there were large metal cylinders coming up out of the ground throughout the area to vent the gas from decomposing garbage underground. as a fellow volunteer and i walked down a dirt path, two men approached us. i'd never seen them before. they were acting strangely, but i just thought they were drunk or high--a lot of people in the area drank rubbing alcohol to get drunk, since it was cheaper than beer or liquor. over time, drinking the rubbing alcohol would really mess with their brains. as the men got closer, they began acting really friendly--too friendly. one of them came close to me, trying to put his arm around my shoulders. at first, it seemed like the behavior of a guy who gets happy and friendly when he's drunk. however, an alarm went off in my head, and i gently--but firmly--pushed him away. i tried to make it seem lighthearted and playful, like, ""hey, man! how's it going?"" (affectionate shove.) i didn't want to make a scene, since i was a gringo; i didn't want to seem like an ugly american. this went on over and over down the whole path--he'd get close, i'd shove him off, he'd come close again. finally, my friend and i came to a fork in the path, and we went one way while they went another. after we got to the house of some people we knew, we told them about the two guys. (i was so focused on protecting myself, i didn't even notice much of what was happening with the other guy.) they said, ""oh, everyone around here knows him. that's his routine--he comes up to people, pretends to be friendly, puts him arm around them, then pulls out his knife and stabs them in the stomach."" i was *that* close to getting stabbed to death."

[SEP]	"wow - a serious post i can actually comment on. it wasn't a murder attempt (maybe it was.?) but a stabbing attempt i guess. happened when i was around 12-13 years old. i was taking a lifeguarding course at a local pool with a friend of mine which had about 16 people in the class. the age ranges in the class can vary, and we probably had a mix of people between 12-18, but most were somewhere in the middle. there was this one kid, probably 16-17 that really stood out to me and my friend as the typical ""school shooter"" type. very solemn look on his face at all times, socially awkward and extremely quiet. we both got really strong serial killer vibes from him. it's just one of those instincts you feel that tells you ""something isn't right"" we made a few jokes between ourselves about it, as we both noticed it almost immediately and were fairly uncomfortable being around him. this lasted for probably the first 2 hours of the 4 hour class. at that point we were asked to switch from pool instruction into a classroom, and had about 20 minutes to change and get into the classroom. as we are all changing, this guy kept looking over at me and my friend - we tried not to make eye contact with him and just ignore it but we were getting extremely uncomfortable with how intensely the guy was staring. we were the only 3 in the changeroom and were intent on leaving as fast as possible. eventually, my friend makes eye contact with the guy, who screams something along the lines of ""stop looking at me"", pulling a switchblade out of his swim bag and lunging at my friend. i stood there, somewhat frozen as this was happening and didn't really know what to do - whether to try and help or run. my friend ended up blocking the initial lunge with the locker door, and he sprinted towards the front exit of the changeroom, with this enraged knife-wielding teenager chasing him. when my friend had made it out of the changeroom the maniac turned around and started chasing me down. with pool deck floors, they are extremely slippery and almost impossible to run on but 12 year old me wasn't exactly worried about that at this point. &#x200b; i had to run from the changeroom/locker area, through the bathrooms, through a shower room and then onto the pool deck (the only other exit) all i remember is him catching up to me and he must have been within reach at some point on this 100m run, but i remember turning around once i made it on the pool deck and the guy was gone. i was half dressed, and basically still sprinting towards the lifeguard office. &#x200b; once there i found our instructor and told him what happened - and he didn't believe me. he said i was lying and was just picking on the kid, nothing happened. etc. so i told him to try and find my friend with me (i was panicking, hyperventilating, but apparently not believable). my friend was still out in the lobby now with a ton of concerned parents around trying to figure out what was going on. turns out when he blocked the knife with the locker door the knife got his forearm and he was bleeding pretty badly (not arterial, but probably a 6"" gash on the hairy part of your arm) immediately my instructor ushered us away and called the police, building went into lockdown, etc. &#x200b; to this day i have no idea what happened to that kid - he never came back to the class, and the police didn't find him that night. i'm assuming he got arrested but i never heard about it. it was probably the closest i ever came to getting killed and i'm not exactly sure why/how he didn't stab me, or if he slipped and fell before making it to me. he was considerably larger than me and definitely faster. &#x200b; all i know now is i should trust my instincts more with people - they might turn out to be true. &#x200b; **tl;dr: almost got stabbed by a knife-wielding teenager in a lifeguarding course, ran out and the teacher didn't believe me, found friend with a bloody arm and the kid disappeared.**"	[SEP]	802

[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	so, i did not know it was a murder attempt at the time, but looking back now - it was a definite possibility. in middle and high school my next door neighbors were a boy one year younger than me (john) and his younger brother who was four years younger than him (nathan.) my own younger brother and i had a similar age gap, and we found ourselves around each other all the time. now i am a female and the rest of the group was all males, so there were just naturally times when the three of them would hang and i wouldn't be around. &#x200b; one day my little brother who was around 9 at the time comes home with a porno mag and is telling me about the porn videos they were watching as a little unit. now guys, i have no idea if this is something that is done in your pre/adolescent circles, but it freaked me the hell out and i told my mom. my mom then went and told their single dad. what i didn't know was their dad was an abusive piece of shit who beat both of those boys so badly that they couldn't go to school for weeks. no, we didn't call the police - we just filed it away and knew from that point forward to never tattle. i still carry the guilt of telling on john and nathan with me to this day, because it set off a chain of events i would have never anticipated. &#x200b; as we got older, the brothers started acting out more and more; bullying other kids, vandalism, weird shit like toying with road kill. as the level headed female in the group i opposed all of these things, and a faction emerged with me and the other neighborhood kids on one side, and john and nathan on the other just fucking shit up and causing trouble. one day i had done something to piss off john, and he came at me with a large chef's knife. i didn't have shoes on, so i took off running through the backyard and crossed into the neighbor's. john was hot on my tail, trailing me by maybe 4 feet when i fell down. there was some sort of exposed pvc drainage pipe that had been shattered at the top that i didn't see it and ran over, my foot was sliced open immediately and i went down screaming. i think it shocked him; my screaming, the sudden change of pace, and the blood. he stopped, laughed at me, then ran home- presumably so he didn't get his ass whipped. &#x200b; after i took care of myself, i told my mom what happened with the knife. she had started dating someone new, and i think this was the sort of feather that broke the camels back. we moved to another part of town in the same district about a ten-minute drive from our old house. around that exact time we moved in, a new family moved into the house on the other side of john and nate. &#x200b; things continued down a bad path for those boys. over the next year they got in trouble with school, and would randomly show up at our new house locked out of their own. the year i went off to college i received a panicked phone call from my mom telling me to look up the local newspaper, john had murdered the girl who had moved into the other house next door to him. it was really grisley too, he chopped her up and stuffed her into a trunk that sat outside in his dad's car all day while a family picnic was happening. he and his little brother got caught trying to throw the trunk into the river from a bridge at night by a cop who happened to be driving by. i just thought to myself that could have been me! both brothers have been locked up for what has to be about ten years at this point, they were both tried and convicted as adults. everyone in our town just wants to see them burn in hell, but honestly the only thing i can think about is how it might have been different if our family reported the abuse from the onset - maybe their little minds would'nt have warped from a tender age.

[SEP]	i got jumped by two grown men when i was a freshmen in college. i was walking back from my friends house and it was about 30 past midnight. one posed as a homeless man asking for a dollar and the other had on a security jacket like he worked for the universitys safety patrol. when i passed the homeless guy saying i had nothing to give him, i saw the security guy walking towards me. this is when i felt a rear neck choke hold and the security guy started whaling on me. i had my bag on me, but like i said, i literally had nothing on me. they couldnt take me down to the ground (surprisingly.i mustve had an adrenaline rush). the guy posing as a homeless guy said open the back pack, find anything lets dip. this lasted about 2-3 minutes, but it felt like forever. the whole time i could feel something pointy in my back, but i just like to think that the guy was extremely excited, and it wasnt a knife. luckily, it was right outside my friends house and a couple of them came running out when they heard the commotion. the guys fled immediately when 3 of my friends came sprinting towards them. i still look behind me when i walk home alone.

[SEP]	"when i was two weeks into my first job as a 16 year old (at a smoothie establishment that should be known to nba fans), we were robbed. it was late, and my coworker's friends had been playing pranks on her all day, so when i saw someone burst through the door, i thought it was just that. until, that is, i had something metal pressed against my back and an arm wrapped around my chest. the robber gave the whole stereotypical ""give me all the money"" spiel, and ordered us to go into the back room, kneel down, and face the wall. as i was kneeling and hearing him walking towards us, time seemed to slow down. thankfully, i had been refilling juices whenever he came in, and so the door to the back room was partially blocked by a heavy cart. with whatever substance he was on, he wasn't coordinated enough to get past it to us, so he fled. he was followed by my coworker's husband and caught. when he was caught, they found an industrial sized pipe wrench wrapped tightly in his fist, so that he could get a stronger grip when swinging. i'm so glad that cart was there. once a year or so, i would look him up in the parish prison roster to see if he was still in jail. one year, he suddenly wasn't. i later found him named in a lawsuit as having stabbed his cellmate a half dozen times while the guy was asleep. definitely doesn't seem like the nicest of people. nine years later, i'm still unpacking this incident in therapy - it's why i dont like walking around cities at night or sitting where i can't see the door."

[SEP]	in my late teens, i used to buy my weed from random dudes in the projects (low income housing.) one day we gave some money to a guy named 40. he took it and went inside one of the buildings. we waited in the car for several minutes. we started to think he had taken our money and left. right about that time, a car full of coked-up white dudes pulled up beside ours. apparently my friend owed them money. they pointed a gun at him and said that if he had enough money to buy weed, then he could pay them back. i really thought they were going to shoot us and just drive off like it was nothing, and i hadn't even done anything wrong. i thought i was gonna pee my pants. right about that time, 40 came back out with our weed and an even bigger gun. he scared them away and then we went back to his apartment and smoked a blunt. what a good man. turns out he was only selling weed because he had a 6-year-old daughter and that was the only way he knew to give her a better life than he had. i babysat his daughter occasionally for the rest of that summer. i really hope she got a decent childhood and that her dad stayed safe and out of jail. **tldr; almost got shot but was saved by random drug dealer who turned out to be a decent fellow.**	[SEP]	9134
[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	i was out with a few friends, and with us was a girl that had just broken up with a psychopath (we didn't know he was a psychopath, we found out that night). we were just walking back home from a restaurant, it was about 1 am, and the guy came running out of nowhere, i don't know how he knew where and when to meet us. he ran to the girl, lifted her shirt up and stabbed her in the gut, literally splitting her belly open like a fish, and then ran off. this whole thing happened really quickly, so we were all in shock. the girl was holding her own intestines in her hands and she was so shocked that she didn't even seem scared, wasn't screaming or anything. she just stood there. we called an ambulance and they managed to somehow put everything back and sew her up. this happened about 3 years ago and she still has pretty serious problems with her digestive tract, can't eat certain things and that kind of stuff. that image of her just standing in the middle of the pathway holding her own guts will remain stuck in my head forever. the guy got 13 years in jail btw. edit: now that i think about it, a big part of why they broke up was his constant abuse towards her weight. she wasn't even fat, just a bit on the chubby side, i wouldn't even call that overweight, but he would always tell her that she had a big gut. that was almost an obsession for him. so maybe the fact that he stabbed her in the abdomen is a symbolic action of some sort. i don't know what was in that fuckhead's brain and i honestly don't even want to know.

[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	when i was a kid i was riding my bike home from a friends house at sunset. i rode past the community pool which had been closed for a couple months. there was a car in the lot with a guy in it. i didnt think much of it as i continued the trek home. i cut through the local elementary parking lot which has gates. i get like 20 yards past the gate and i see that car pull up at the bottom. thinking thats odd. anyhow he backs out away from the gate. my spidey senses were kinda tingling at this point. i get up to the school and head towards teacher parking lot which is my standard direction. as im about to turn the corner i see headlights from the parking lot. i stop and peek around the corner and its that fucking guy again. i flip my bike around and start going the long way around the school. he sees me but just gets back in his car. and starts driving around the front of the school. i camp in these bushes, heart pounding. he is slowly driving up and down the front of the school keeping an eye on the teachers lot. another car comes down the street and he has to move his dumb car out of their way. as soon as he does i just blasted up to the street and full tilt flew my bike into some random open garage. so im hiding in the garage waiting for him to come around again. but he doesnt. i give it a few minutes then decide to pop my head out. still no one. ok im a few blocks from home just gotta go for it. bust out the bike and start hauling ass home. not half a fucking block later this dude turns the corner on me. i just veer my bike into some random lawn and run up to the front door. i look at him and hes just in the street staring at me. i grip the front door handle praying to any and every god these people dont lock their doors. i see his reverse lights flicker and i know he just put it in park. i just rip that door open, run inside and slam it. two old people just sitting there. i look at them and im like some dude is trying to get me out there. they dont completely believe me cause they barely react to what i said. but they dont kick me out or anything either. im watching the dude from their window and hes just chilling. then the grandpa looking dude gets up from his lazy boy and opens the curtain to look for himself. when he does this the asshat in the car just leaves. old guy is like well looks like hes gonna leave. im like im not leaving for a bit. so i hang out for 10 min and no creepy abductor car to be seen. i assume he figured i called the cops. finally im like i have to get home. this is before cell phones were common for average people. i hop on my bike and i swear it felt like i drove 35 mph the whole way home. get home and tell my parents. im exhausted and in complete shock. they basically brush me off. im stunned that every adult i interacted with acted like i was crazy. i basically never talked about it again it was so traumatic to talk about at the time. that image of him in his car while i held the door handle to the random house is permanently seared into my brain. to this day its still as crystal clear as if it happened yesterday. like 18-20 years later i decided to confront my parents as to why they didnt do anything that day. they were like wtf you talking about. i explained it far better than i couldve when i was a kid in complete shock. anyhow, with the current, more expansive explanation my mother b-b-b-broke down. she started crying at this public restaurant cause she saw how serious i was when i was like how could you ignore what i said that day. as well as talked about how that morphed my stranger danger techniques for better or worse. thankfully i was on the verge of puberty and ended up becoming a giant human being so my actual fears diminished quickly as i could defend myself. until i moved away from that town however, i looked every day for that god damned car. never saw it again. i would fantasize about what id like to do if i ever found that guy, hell, i still do. tldr dude tried abducting me at like 10-12 years old. got lucky hiding in random garage and some old peoples house. never got any level of justice edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger	[SEP]	6550

[SEP]	not sure if this counts but i was a lifeguard on one of the local beaches. i was out patrolling in the truck by myself and got a call for a medical aid at one of the condos behind the boardwalk. i grab everything and head over. this is fairly unusual but we do respond from time to time to stuff off the beach since we're closer and do what we can until medics show up. knock on the guys door, identify myself, and then enter residence. it's a younger guy, clearly on drugs, blood around the area of his wrists, and he's just looking at me dumbfounded. as i begin to ask him what the problem is my supervisor walks in, grabs my shoulder, and basically pulls me out of the condo. turns out this guy had called in about committing suicide and threatened to kill anyone that entered the residence. obviously they shouldn't have sent me in there and it ended up being a pretty big deal with people getting reprimanded for telling me to respond instead of waiting for police.

(and he def had drugs on him too) not sure what he got convicted of but he went to jail for 4 years. edit: sorry for the confusion over acrylic vs glass guys. im not the biggest stoner it seems. i guess the bong was just glass not acrylic.

[SEP]	i was shot while working in a small independent video game shop. this place was a very small store in a somewhat sketchy area, but we had never had problems before. on the night in question, a gentleman came in and, without saying a word, goes straight into the porn section/caged off area. the gentleman emerges from the porn cage with his selections and proceeds to toss his selections on the counter. now this part is very important. i go to retrieve the discs for the pornography in question, which we kept in giant cd binders that held about 500-750 discs when completely full, which they were in this case, since we had just received some new stuff. as i turn to place the binders on the counter, i hear what i now know to be the hammer being cocked. at the time i thought nothing of it since it is a video game store and we had demos on and available for people to play. as i turned to face the customer, i can now see the customer has a gun out and pointed at me. a moment or two passed with neither of us saying anything, and me holding the binders in front of my chest. and then he pulled the trigger. i don't remember much else after that, mostly because i was face down on the ground trying very hard not to move, breath obviously, or make any kind of noise. i hear him go through the register (he got all $60 in there) and then go through the game cases (he stole at least five empty psp game cases) before he bolted. according to the emt's who tended to me, the bullet traveling through the stack of three completely full(ish) cd binders slowed the bullet down enough to the point where it hardly penetrated. it only went about 1-2 inches deep and i somehow managed to get hit in the one area of my chest/shoulder area where nothing vital was. tl;dr guy shot me at work in order to rob the place, porn saved my life. \*edit: spelling and grammar errors \*edit: here is my proof (warning: giant hairy chest and the scar looks a blurry nipple, so slightly nsfw) [http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz](http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz)	[SEP]	990

[SEP]	"about 10 years ago i used to share a 3 bedroom apartment with a friend, so we had a spare room. at some point he told me he had met some nice guy, who was older and a philosophy book translator, and he was looking for a place. i thought the extra money would be nice so i was ok with it. so the guy moves in, he's very reclusive so we don't talk much, but i start to get a weird vibe from him. one day i had to go to work meeting about 3 hours earlier than normal, so i woke up, dressed and left. he and my other friend had already left, so the apartment was left unattended. the meeting was over sooner than i anticipated, so i decided i would have lunch at home. when i arrive at the building, there's a fire truck in the streets, and the doorman runs towards me as soon as he sees me, telling that there was a gas leak in my apartment and they had to cut the gas to the whole building, and they were about to break into the apartment to check. when i enter the apartment i immediately smell the gas, and when i go check the kitchen i see all the stove's valves open. i called my friend and told him what happened, he called the other guy and he didn't answer. i went to check his bedroom and it was empty. the guy just left with all his stuff and tried to asphyxiate me while i slept. i didn't pursue it, and we never heard of the guy again. **edit: ok, i know i should have pursued it. it was over 10 years ago, i was young and this whole thing was very scary. i lost my sleep for weeks after this, and i still check the stove even 10 years later. the thing is, where i live, the police usually won't pursue ""attempted"" anything unless you have a shitload of money, which i don't. and at the time me and my friend decided to let it go because we would have no way to prove he actually did it, and it wasn't one of us who forgot the stove's valves open (the first thing i did when i saw them open was to close them all). i know i fucked up. things would be very different if they happened today.**"	[SEP]	1130

[SEP]	i was 16 and staying in my older brother's house. in the house was my older brother and his wife, their two children and my sister's daughter, i was sleeping on the sofa as my brother and i had been playing gran turismo on the playstation late. anyway, the weekend before my brother had a bit of a get together with friends and family and someone tried to gatecrash it, the guy started a fight, got beat, and then left. the following thursday was the day i was staying and at 5am i find myself awake in the bathroom with blood squirting from my head and the bath had loads of blood in it, next thing i know is i'm back downstairs in the living room looking in the mirror, blood still gushing from my head, and all over the furniture, walls, kids toys, everything really. the guy who tried gatecrashing the party the previous weekend had brought a friend and kicked the front door open, his friend went upstairs to the master bedroom to attack my brother, while the main guy got me while sleeping, he started hitting me on the head with a claw hammer, with the claw part, after a while i remembered that i woke up and had automatically kicked out at him and hit him clean on the nose breaking his nose. he said that's the last thing your gonna do you wee bastard. the next thing i knew i was in the bathroom etc. police were called and they were found, just after dropping their weapons and scarves which they used to cover their faces. they only got 5 years each for attempted murder. not long after getting out of jail, one of them commited suicide, sadly it wasn't the one who tried to kill me	[SEP]	114
[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	"when i was 15 my schoolfellow, whose brother i was friendly with, asked me to follow him outside to a lightly wooded area behind our school where kids used to go smoke. everything seemed totally normal- we were making casual small conversation- and once we got to the spot i said ""hold on, i have to take a piss"". turned my back on him to do the deed and next thing i felt was a super hard punch to my upper right back. turns out this ""punch"" was actually a stab- specifically, a stab with an 8"" knife. he was kind enough to a) inform me i'd been stabbed and b) remove the knife. survival instinct kicked in and i fell to the ground pretending to be dead, because he would of kept going otherwise. once i fell to the ground he took my watch off my hand, which we soon learned (according to him) was the impetus for the stabbing- he planned to pawn it (a $200 fossil watch my mom bought my on vacation to italy a couple years earlier) and buy some coke. once he ran off and i started getting up i noticed something was very wrong. i couldn't breath. my friends happened to be behind the school when i emerged from the wooded area yelling for them to go get help as i'd just been stabbed. they thought i was joking around as i usually did, but one of them finally came over after i fell to my knees and saw i was being for real, blood going everywhere. they'd fetched a teacher who proved to be the human embodiment of incompetence- she got the bright idea to have me lay on my stomach, which could of expedited the process of flooding my lungs with blood, but thankfully didn't as i only stayed in that position for a few seconds. the pain began to intensify as i was constantly gasping for air, but also some nerve damage had been done and my movement was greatly constricted. they propped me up against the lockers by the back entrance, where my blood coated the wall, and it took about 25 min for the ambulance to arrive. i was still in a great deal of pain even with the oxygen mask on, but it was nothing compared to the pain i'd experience shortly after in the er/or where they made a 5-6"" incision under my armpit in order to get at my lung so that they could insert a chest tube. the feeling of having the doctors hands inside of me, feeling around and holding my lung while i was still awake (under local anaesthetic) is the most bizarre thing i've ever encountered and a sensation i will never forget. i still don't know why they couldn't have put me under fully for such a procedure instead of administering local all around my body. at this point my parents had been brought in and were in hysterics after seeing me on the or table with blood everywhere. my mom was at home when the principal called to notify her what'd happened and ordered a cop to drive her to the hospital, a trauma centre about 30 min away from our home. my dad was at work on a construction site and went into a rage, getting together a band of his friends/workers to come to the hospital to find out who did this- they wanted to go kill the guy, but my mom managed to talk some sense into him. i was the most innocent 15 year old kid, never into drugs, alcohol, gangs, etc. and struggled for a long time with the question of ""why me?"" when there were so many much worse people out there than me. not that anyone deserves this kind of punishment. was a $200 watch worth it? i spent a couple weeks in the hospitals trauma unit and then a further month or two at home recovering. whoever stitched me up did a horrible job as they kept coming undone and i had to visit the er several times to have that fixed. bleeding out in public was not fun. psychologically it honestly didn't do too much damage as i think i was just too young to grasp the full weight of what'd happened. but physically it left the entire area around my upper right back and right arm/armpit completely numb for the rest of my life. i was also told that the lung could randomly collapse at any time-- apparently that's a possibility for those having suffered a traumatic pneumothorax, can anyone confirm?--, but it's been almost 15 years since the incident and i haven't had any major issues with the lung thus far. the guy who did it was 17 and protected by the young offenders act here in canada, which means he did zero jail time for this. i think he just got some community service hours. blows my fucking mind- what a dysfunctional system."

[SEP]	"any of those stupid robbots on youtube, i don't give any of you permission to use this in your video. like a decade+ or so when i was a kid my family and i took a trip to tanzania for safaris. well, one night near the kenyan border we were out spotlighting for bush babies when a pair of headlights appear in the distance and blocks our car. a bunch of dudes with aks hop out of their truck and our tour guide drops his head to the wheel and keeps his hands on it. me, being what like 10 whined ""what's happening"" and my parents basically quietly and sternly told me to shut the fuck up and stay down. any time the guys with guns ask our tour guide questions he would just mumble responses and not look up. apparently my mom watched the dudes rubbing their crotches and staring at her and my sister (who is just a year older than me). after probably like 10 minutes (but it was so long ago and i was so young i don't really know) the dudes put their guns down, hop in their vehicle, and drive away. while pressing our tour guide for questions we would only get response like ""oh they were just game wardens looking for poachers"" and other bullshit. turns out it was (according to my parents after snooping around) a kenyan militia who goes around and kidnaps tourist groups to hold for ransom. they stop one group, call up the owner of the park/ preserve, and say basically they'll let this group go if he agrees to pay the ransom but if he doesn't they'll kill them and ruin his business if they don't get x amount of money. if the game warden agrees to their ransom then they let the first group go. if he doesn't then they kill and/or rape them. and then try again with the next group. if he doesn't pay the ransom by then, well you get the picture. awfully, although this was one of the more urgent near death experiences our family has had, we still laugh about it since something terrible like this happens on nearly every trip we go on with the family. israel and egypt, nearly had bombs go off on us. south africa, got stuck in a river with a very territorial hippo and jeep stuck on a termite mound with a very pissed leopard stalking us. also in tanzania i stuck my face in a boomslang and didn't notice. india something else happened but i don't remember what, i'll add it if i remember. it's a running gag with our family at this point, and we just assume any family trip we take something awful will go wrong. so much weird random shit happens to our family that our friends ask ""what happened this time?"" after a trip. edit i remembered another story from south africa, while we were out on safari a thunderstorm had rolled in, so we headed back to the camps. a bolt of lightning had struck the building directly next to ours (like 15 feet away) and burned it to the ground. the lady who was staying there, another tourist, handled it super well. she was just excited to have a cool story to tell! sadly she lost her luggage and passports in the fire but i'm sure it ended up okay. she didn't seem too troubled."

[SEP]	"i have posted this elsewhere. but ill give a short version. when i was 3 my father threw me into a 6ft deep pool and laughed as a drown. i did die and i still remember it. i was dead about 90 seconds, thankfully my mum found me, got me out and got me going again. so technically i was murdered, and then reset. still fear water on my face. that shit doesnt leave you. edit- some people have asked for a more detailed account of my life. that will be commented from this. i am on a phone, so forgive the spelling. so first up let.me say if you get upset over bad things. dont read on. so i had 2 parentd who were both damaged in there own way, my mum emotionally, my father mentally. he was a fkn nutjob in the way if anyone met him, they like him. shame about the real person people didnt see. so an heavily abreviated version of my life on no particular order would be as follows. laying on bed most nights listening to them fight, things getting broken, and him hitting or beating her. i fell asleep to her screams more times than i can begin to imagine. when i was 3 i drown as stated above. why did he do that? i dont remember, i think it had to do with me breaking a model boat he built. when i was 4 i walked in on hin strangling her, he almost succeeded, but my mum had alot of fight in her. she was 4""11, he is 6""3. so. i think you can see the advantage he had. he started on me when i was 4, im not sure when the 1st real beating was, i remember breaking his record player, i accidently dropped the arm, and the neddle broke, i got a belt, slapped, punched for that. few months later mum had a hysterectomy, hip to hip cut, was way back in the day, 1988 i belive. 3 weeks later he wanted his husband rights. i woke to the screams and tears, another night, but is was different. he raped her in the loungue, id call it a fucking blood bath but that just doesnt emphasize the level of brutality of watching your father rape your mum while he strangles her and punches her. i dont know how long i stood there. felt like forver. he started interfeering with me a little after that. dont ask. use your imagination. but whatever you csn fathom, your correct. thay was my life till i was 9, beatings, rape, torture, burns, and neglect. scratched his boke when i was 9, got beaten black and blue for that, still have the scars on my back. he pulled 15% of my hair out on boxing day, i didnt want to sleep in a car. so i got punished. we left a few days later. so the proceesjng years were death threats, stalking, cops, lawyers, put into hiding by major crime, councellers and more. i got into weed to cope, and tried suicide more than once. became an alcoholic more than once. hit my share of doors, self harmed. life got better. mum had a fall and slipped into a coma xmas day in the early 2000's. i was 18. shr lost 11.5 years. memory when she woke 3.5 days later. she said i was 7. my sister 5. oh and ni the father never touched her. i stood betwern them i took it for her. so i out my life on hold till i was 21 to help my mum return to herself. thats the short version leaving out alot."

[SEP]	"it wasn't technically a murder attempt, but i was almost the victim of a serial killer. this was in austin, texas, in 1993. i was leaving the campus on friday evening, from the 40 acres parking area, and crossed the bridge over the freeway. a woman came up to the car and asked if i could drive her to her house a couple of blocks away. i was a pretty naive 18 year old, didn't realize she was really a hooker, and said yes. she gave me directions and asked it i could give her some money for groceries. i had a $20 and gave it to her. she asked what i wanted and i said i just wanted to help. she looked at me for a second and said ""pull over right here. get out of here as fast as you can."" so i pulled over and she said ""go! fast!"" turns out the police had been keeping quiet about 3 or 4 robbery/murders in the area. i saw the woman on the news a few years later when they finally found the killers."

[SEP]	i was 14 and a runaway, living on the streets with other street kids. i was hanging out with this one guy, we'll call him john, and he invited me to sleep that night in this hidden abandoned apartment in a closed parking garage that he had been staying in. i accepted but there was no funny business as i wasn't interested. everything's cool and we go to sleep. in the early hours of the morning he wakes me up and tells we gotta go because the place is on fire. the room is filled with smoke and the doorway to the room we were in was in flames so we had to jump over the fire to get out. we managed to get out but we were covered in soot. i was so thankful that he saved my life. i must have thanked him a hundred times that day for saving me and i still thought about him long after i went back home a few weeks later. about a year later i'm on the bus when i see two people i used to know from back them. we chatted a few, then i asked about if they knew john. they tell me yeah, they knew john and asked me if i knew he had tried to kill some girl. the shocked look on my face told them i didn't know and they tell me this story about john taking some girl to that old parking garage and then setting the place on fire. he was going to kill her but at the last minute changed his mind and ran back in and woke her up. and that's the day i found out the guy who saved my life had actually chickened out on murdering me. it might be why i still have trust issues from time to time.

[SEP]	bit late to the partay but something i can actually respond to. worked in a restaurant with a chef who suffered with bipolar but also refused to take their medication. self medicated with coke instead. told me to tell our boss he resigned, i did. he retracted the next day and said i had lied which my boss did not believe as he trusted me a lot and knew i would not benefit from that as prior to the resignation, me and the chef were very much best friends. next thing i know, hes quit for realsies and we operated with limited menu minus our head chef. i worked a split shift, on my break im walking home and see a car fly past at a junction. ignore it and carry on walking. then, the car rapidly reverses and veers towards me. ina. split second i had to decide whether i was in danger or not, no idea who was behind the wheel. i chose to jump into a garden next to me and seconds later this car halts exactly where i had been standing. the chef then leans out the window and screams insult after insult at me, blaming me for his quitting his job and claims he had no knowledge of our conversation where he quit. he then reversed and revs towards me. i run out of the garden and he rapidly revs and follows me. a lorry pulls up at the junction and sees the situation, and shouts if im okay. this distracted the chef and i ran, so fast, all the way home. i walked through my front door and cried so much i could barely move because i was bent over double trying to breath. now, i never get involved in anything at my work. my boss is very protective of me thankfully and i feel safe. for a long time (even now a little) i was terrified to walk on my own but also terrified i would risk someone getting hurt if he saw me again. i frequently have nightmares and am terrified if a chef loses his temper (which they do often). sorry for the essay! i know no one will see this but its good to write it out. edit: apparently i ran, so fart. i probably would have farted if my butthole wasnt clenched tight but no i ran, so fast. haha.

[SEP]	"posted this in r/askreddit a couple years ago: ""almost 20 years ago now i had a guy offer to walk with me. it was. 3 am? i'm a guy. at that point a fairly wild one who didn't think about being anywhere, doing anything, time of day, etc. the dude just kind of appeared on the street across from me. he started half-shouting a monologue at me. at first i just ignored it figuring he as hammered drunk, told him ""nah, i'm good"" and kept strutting, not thinking twice about him. a dog trotted out of some yard and started walking next to me. he asked if it was mine. ""nope"". then he asked if i smoked weed. i told him ""yup"" so he asked i wanted to share a joint. ""nope"". then he told me he'd sprinkle some coke on it if i wanted. ""nope"". the whole time he hasn't crossed the street. he's just woofing at me. but he's looking around all over the place. seems to be checking to see if there are any other people out. my spidey senses started to tingle at that point. i was only a few blocks from my house so i figured i'd just keep walking and head in. that's when he asked if i wanted to see his gun. ""no thanks"". instead of going home i turned in to a gangway between two houses and realized that an acquaintance of mine lived in one of the houses so i started pounding on her door. after a few seconds i peeked out to the street and didn't see the guy so i wandered out to the front yard, looked around and he was gone. disappeared. maybe. 3 weeks later i saw in the newspaper that the police had arrested a guy who was a suspect in several sexual assaults, rapes and murders in the general area over a period of years. it was that dude. if something feels out of the ordinary or uncomfortable. trust your instinct."""

[SEP]	true story: when i was married my husband had a really well paying job that required him to travel a lot. we had a big beautiful house in north carolina surrounded by 122 acres of woods. the house was located 5 miles off the main highway. the only way to the house was by our private drive way. my husband left to go on a trip for work in new york and i was left at home with our chocolate lab, sam. i was only 21 at the time and ive never stayed home alone again. on the 3rd night that my husband was gone i went to the grocery store earlier around 8 and got some snack. on the way out the door a man with really broken english attempted to ask me for some money. i told him i didnt have anything to give him as i dont carry cash. he told no its ok. and i watched him get into a white cargo van and drive off. i drive home and cannot fall asleep, so i stay up watching tv. at 1:30 am someone begins to bang on the front door, which almost makes my heart explode. i grab my husbands revolver and his shot gun bc i am freaked. the man continues to bang on the door and tells me his van broke down and he needs gas money. its a familiar voice and broken english- its the same guy from the grocery store. he trys everything to open the door and the windows before i finally scream at him to leave bc i will not think twice to shoot him. he finally walks off the porch and i run upstairs and look out the window to see him getting into that same van from the store but this time i can see inside the van and there are 5 other men with him all dressed in black and they all have mask- like scary masks. after a few minutes of sitting there they move the car. i texted my father in law and the police were coming- they just had a difficult time finding the house. once the officers take my statement they tell me i have to talk to someone- a fucking fbi agent who tells me that this is a very familiar story to human traffickers and my features are highly desirable. he also tells me to be very alert from now on and never go out at night alone. this messed me up for a while and i never stay anywhere alone.

[SEP]	sept 15th 1990 9pm north rivers ave charleston, sc. 19year old me had recently graduated from navy boot camp, tech school and had been at my first duty station in charleston for maybe a couple months. stopped to use a pay phone at a dimly lit gas station parking lot to call my gf in another state. didn't realize i was in the hood. guy snuck up behind me and went full babe ruth with a baseball bat to the back of my head, i never saw it coming. only lost consciousness for 3 or 4 seconds but they seemed like an eternity. i distincly remember thinking this is wierd, did i go blind? i can't hear, see or feel anything. came to about 10 feet awayfrom the phone, looked up as he was swinging at me again. dodged it, got away and he didn't seem interested in chasing me. he calmly got into my car (i had dropped the keys when he hit me) started the car and sneered at me. i picked up a rock, now filled with anger and fear, figured i'm going to go out, go out swinging. fight ensued with him seated in the drivers seat, me at the door. somehow he lost the top half of his left ear but eventually got the car in gear and drove off. my gf was still on the phone, told her what happened said i'd call her later. walked 2 blocks towards the hospital before a couple other navy guys saw me and gave me a ride. fractured skull, bruised chest from my chin hitting it, 27 stitches to the back of the head and a pretty bad concussion. navy docs stitched me, gave me ibuprofen and sent me back to the ship that night. don't remember much for the next 3 days but police found my car in another county, stripped of course. also found his ear in the parking lot. it was a shitty car too, a dodge daytona.the front wheel drive 80s version.

[SEP]	this isnt my story, but it is my dads. back in 1979 my dad was a orphaned high schooler living with his evil, nasty aunt who he was left in custody to several years earlier due to my grandmother passing. his cousin from ireland, brian, had come to live with them as well at some point in 79. brian was just as evil and nasty and with a terrible drinking problem. but everyone in the family loveeedddd brian and thought he was the victim all the time. no matter what brian did, he was the angel and my dad was the harasser and the bully. brian registry stole money from my dad, planted drugs on him in an attempt to get him arrested two months before my dad left for the marine corp and ultimately tried to have my dad murdered. my dad was walking home after his late night shift at mcdonalds when a car came careening at him off the road onto the sidewalk. my dad jumped into a bush and narrowly avoided the car. my dad gets up and sees that its a friend of brians who is a local drunk. i cant remember his name but we will call him john. john revs the car in reverse and forward again in an attempt to hit my dad again. he misses again and starts chasing my dad up the street with the car going up and off the sidewalks trying to nick my dad. this went on for about two minutes until finally john crashed the car into a telephone pole. john gets out of the car and drunkenly starts to chase my dad and tell him hes gonna fucking kill him. my dad was luckily in better shape because he was preparing to go into the marines. he was able to outrun john and took refuge at a local convenience store. my dad never called the cops or pressed charges because he was leaving in two months and because his previous run in with the cops when john planted the drugs on him left a bad taste in his mouth with the local law enforcement. he never also told much of the family anyways since they all sided with brian as it was for everything. this left my dad and his family at odds for many years and he didnt speak to much of his immediate family for nearly a decade or so afterwards when some fences were mended. the day brian died from cirrhosis in 06 and my dad found out he told his aunt that he hoped brian was rotting in hell. i tried to condense the story as best as i could. if anyone has any questions just feel free to act tl;dr my dads alcoholic cousin tried to have him murdered literally for no reason.

[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	my brother tried to kill me. he was in the kitchen and i was in the room attached to it on the computer. he was talking loudly and asked a question, i told him i had no idea and he snapped. yelled that he was talking to himself not me and to shut up etc. he grabbed a pair of big scissors, opened them up and said he was going to slit my throat and came at me. i managed to run faster and lock myself in another room. when he was trying to break through it (managed to get a big crack down the door) my parents came home. i was 14, he was 22 or 23. my mom told me if it ever happened again he would get kicked out. so it got completely ignored. when it did happen a second time, all 4 of us kids were playing a game and i was joking around with my sister. he told me to shut up grabbed a decorative sword off his bedroom wall and swung it at me. i moved fast enough it hit my chair and i bolted. i went upstairs and told my parents, my mom stormed off and said 'thanks for ruining christmas'. apparently i shouldn't care that it happened, i should 'get over it'. caused issues between me and my parents, my mom especially. years later i was told, what do you expect he's family. sometimes you let things go to hold the family together. i told her that makes sense for small things, but big things like this just show the kid that they don't matter. how could i ever think i mattered to them when they didn't care or help when someone tried to end my life. ignoring it showed how little i mattered and my whole family made me think i was fucked for not seeing how i should drop it. still have to be around him at times unfortunately.or at least i did until recently. i don't talk to my family any more, shockingly not for that specific reason. since it happened when i was so young, and the way it was handled, i felt like i didn't matter for years. it messed me up big time.

[SEP]	it wasn't a full on premeditated attempt, or as dramatic as some other stories here, but i was pretty deeply affected by mine. during a suicide attempt 2 years ago, my last so pointed the shotgun at me for a much longer moment than i was comfortable with, and made threatening noises. i just bolted and was outside with multiple walls and corners between us before he could even finish his barely coherent sentence. i was already on the phone with 911, so i just stayed outside in the dark until they arrived. had he come for me, i trusted in my ability to hide, or at least be far enough out of the lethal range of a shotgun to survive, even if he hit me. i have a decent amount of lingering issues from that night i'm still working through in therapy, some related to guns, some related to cops (they searched my home afterwards, made fun of my decor, basically the next several hours sucked and i would love to forget that entire evening ever happened), some related to dating and trusting people in general. pretty normal, i presume.

[SEP]	"i was working at a local grocery store as an assistant customer service associate- i would work early mornings and late nights closing and opening the store. one night i was closing the store and it was about an hour to an hour and a half before closing time- around this time i typically send one of my cashiers to go get carts while i collect registers but this night we were busy and i was stuck on a register so my manager went out to get carts to help me while i was on a register. when he was out there he asked me on my head set if my boyfriend would have left me roses on my car. in response to that, i told him no, because the guy i was dating at the time was at home and didn't have a car. he told me ""huh, that's weird, you have a stuffed animal rose in your car door handle and it has a weird smiley face written on the tag. it must be one of your stalkers"" he said jokingly. but i was wondering who could have left me that- so when it slowed down my manager and i watched footage on the security cameras and we see a car back into the space next to mine- roll down its window- and stick the plush rose into my door handle and speed off. i didn't recognize the car so my manager told me he would walk me to my car when we left. he walked me to my car and i started driving down the road- i got a call from him about one minute later where he sounded frantic saying that the guy who stuck the rose in my handle was waiting in a parking lot across the street and went through our grocery parking lot going about 85 trying to catch up to me and that i was most likely being followed. which is also when my phone died, and i didn't have a charger in my car. i live in a rural country area and hardly ever is anyone behind me by the time i get to my roads to get to my house- i looked behind me and sure enough someone was following me at a strange distance- so, i knew there was an abandoned gas station a little ways down the street so i told myself i'd do a u turn around it and see if the person followed and see if it was the same car. i went around the abandoned pumps and what do you know- it is the same car and he follows me around the pumps too. at this point i want to cry and i'm in a panic. there aren't any police stations near by, my phone is cut off. so, i go about 125 down a windy back road until i can't see him behind me anymore, pull off into some random road, pull into a stranger's house and cut my lights off and wait there for about an hour. i called the cops when i got home and none of them took me seriously and said they wouldn't have been able to do anything about the situation because the person hadn't touched me. a couple weeks pass, and i am out and about to get something for my friend from work's baby shower- i'm at baby's r us and i ran inside and left my window a crack down in my jeep because i knew i'd only be inside for a minute. before i went in i looked at my id and thought that i might want to grab it because i was going to be using a credit card and they might want to see it but i thought to myself ""nahhh if they need it i'll come back out"". turns out, they did need it, so i went out to my car and. my license is gone. and i am very confused. i am an air head and tend to mis place things but i knew i had seen it before i had gotten out of the car- i thought i had gone mad. i brushed it off and just used my debit card instead and honestly kind of forgot about my id and ordered a new one thinking the old one would turn up. fast forward about two days- i had two cops show up at my door. when i answered they asked me if i was ""first middle last name"" and i said ""yes"" and they said ""thank god, we thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere"". at that point i was very confused and they told me that they had arrested a man in ""so and so"" county under some pretty extreme charges and that he had my license and a bunch of photos of me and random stuff of mine on him and in his car during the arrest. i swear i lost all color in my face. they gave me their numbers and said my stuff would be coming in the mail with a deportation officer's number and to give them a call if anything new happens or if i have any questions. i don't know what that guys intentions were, what he would have done if he had followed me home that night and i hadn't noticed, or how long he had been watching me for or following me- but i am so thankful that nothing happened. it wasn't for another month or so of digging that i found out who it had been who had followed me. it was some guy in his late 20's that came into my store often- he'd only ever buy coronas and newport cigarettes and he barely spoke english- he always gave me the heebie jeebies. he had actually come into the store earlier that night- i just didn't know he drove that car. i think about this night/month all the time."

[SEP]	when i was 20 my good friend (18m) and i were stabbed unprovoked (our perspective). he died within the hour and i walked away with minor stab wounds. we had gone to a small party, 10-15 people, in an apartment during a cold -40 winter day. there were 4 of us. we only knew a couple people there but we got along well with everyone there (so we thought). this party was just a pre-drink before a social which most of us were going to walk to. once we showed up we started selecting music that was playing on a laptop with speakers, so we sort of took over the dj position. nobody was actively djing and nobody objected. turns out one of the girls there didn't like the music we were picking, and she had a male friend with her who was a part of a gang. her and her male friend left the party 30 mins prior to drive to the social. once we left we started walking and we heard a honk behind us. turn around and it's the girl and guy who left 30 mins before. now because it's -40 and we seemed to get along well with them, we assume they are going to offer us a ride. so the 4 of us turn around and 2 of us start to jog over, the other 2 walk. once we were close enough, without a single word uttered, the male grabs my friend by the shoulder and swiftly stabs him multiple times and before i could react he turns to me and stabs me as well. after the trial 3 years later i finally learned the cause of this action. the female told him that we were a part of a rival gang and we needed to be dealt with. all because she didn't like our music. rip josh i'll always love you man and i'll never forget. never.

[SEP]	"i was 17 and the yearbook photographer/editor. a guy i knew who was a freshman came in for a print. to print things, you had to go to printer rooms and have a teacher or verified student do the print job. so he comes in with a jump drive. i pop it in and print it for him, don't even bother checking it, because that's what friends do. help each other print their banned materials, right? well, i pull it out of the printer and he asks me to proofread it. i do, and it's a suicide note. while i'm reading it, he walks up behind me and starts to choke me. i mentioned this in another thread just today, but stupid tv tropes saved my life that day. he choked me until i passed out, then left me there with the note. i woke up and stumbled out of the print room and made it to the room of one of my teachers. he called for help and took me to the office. my father ""opted to not press charges"" and the kid was sent to live with his dad in california to ""work on his mental health."" someone pointed out years later that he tried to make it look like i killed myself, by having me hold the note and print it myself l. i still panic if someone touches my neck and it's been almost ten years. i ran into him years later and it was horrific. i'm living across the country now and still dread seeing him."

[SEP]	"when i was about 11 years old, my step father tried to poison me using tuna helper. i don't know what he put in it but i was sick for days. he would watch me and get angrier and angrier as i got better. during the first few days he would smile from ear to ear every time i vomited or passed out. i know it was just mine because i wasn't allergic to any food, and i was the only one who got sick. he and my mother ate the same thing. this was the one time i know he tried to out right kill me. other times it was just playing, he wanted me to hurt. this time he wanted to really get rid of me. ever since then, i can't handle cold pasta or tuna helper of any kind. my body automatically rejects it if i even try to eat it. i didn't realize what happened until years later, when i talked to the man who i call my father (the step dad after) about when his ex wife tried to murder him. she used arsenic, and he now rejects anything almond or hazelnut automatically, his body acts as if it is trying to be poisoned again. i knew then from my own reaction that he tried to kill me. i knew he hated me. the seven years my mom was with him he abused me in pretty much every way. raped me at 9, prostituted me to his friends at 11. when my mom found out just part of what he had done, he said ""she is the spawn of satan, and it is god's will that i punish her"". this was not a metaphor to him. i am so glad that he was enough of an idiot to not know how much of whatever it was to actually kill me. my worst fear is that he will show up again someday to finish the job. he was never arrested, or anything, because i was terrified to say anything. i was a coward. he is out there somewhere. i have a vague knowledge of where. i just hope he has forgotten about me, but i fear for any other children that are unknowingly put in his hands."

[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	i used to live on the outskirts of downtown and would go visit a friend that lived downtown. he lived in a place that's kind of like a halfway house so he wasn't allowed to have overnight guests so i'd leave his place at around 10pm and catch the bus back home. the streetlights at the nearest bus stop were all out and that made me uncomfortable so i decided to walk to the next stop which ended up being an awful decision. there was an old guy under the influence sitting at this bus stop and he tried to hit on me. i ignored him and then he called me a bunch of names and started acting violent. i turned around to walk away and he reached over to grab me by my hair. he starts punching me, we fall to the ground and then he starts slamming my head into the concrete repeatedly. i was so focused on trying to fight back i never screamed or anything. a minute later a group of men end up pulling this guy off of me, restrain him and call the police. if those guys had not been in the area i probably would've died because the old guy was not slowing down. i was too traumatized to show up to court when he was charged so he ended up only serving 3 months.

[SEP]	i dated an abusive guy (obviously didnt know he was like this after knowing home for several years). i was 19 and preparing for a semester abroad while his jealousy started flaring up more and more. it started like typical, get in your head about friends and whatever. but he had got into a fight with one of my friends who tried to protect me from him and he hurt her badly. he never forgave me for it (oh darn) and let me know about it while tormenting me psychologically and verbally. he would come into my personal space like he was going to attack me but not touch me. i finally started to push him away and he took that as a green light to hurt me without actually punching me. i tried to leave the house and he lifted me up and threw me into a pile of wooden kids chairs. he started to choke me when i screamed out the window for help. he pinned my arms down with his knees and and with his hands on my throat said you think you would stop screaming when no one can hear you. i thought i was going to die. he then decided he was going to kill himself instead and ran up stairs for a gun. i fought him for the gun and had doors slammed on me, got kicked multiple times in the stomach, and when i got the gun off of him the ass went for another gun. i talked him out of it and tried to leave in peace. i basically had to go through this one more time until i was able to go abroad and lose him for good.

[CLS]	(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	[SEP]	im reluctant to tell this story because im not sure how popular it will be, but my comments never get upvoted so here goes. in the summer after i graduated high school i decided to finally realize a dream id had growing up in a small town. i worked the whole year to save enough money to live for a couple of months in a city i loved before college. i left with an air mattress, a laptop, a suitcase of clothes, and a few essentials and moved into a shared house. i quickly made friends with my housemates and found that everyone i met had an amazing story and somehow we all ended up there at that moment, i decided i wanted to meet lots of new people and experience everything the city had to offer. i didnt have a car so i would have to use public transit, or walk, for my adventures. a month went by and everything was going better than i had ever dreamed, i was so happy! then one night i decided i wanted to go take pictures of a local spot id frequented in the time id been there. i made a friend who lived in the area and they told me i could come there for the night when i was done since public transport would likely be closed for the night. so i got my things together and made my way there. after i got the pictures i wanted i decided to sit on a bench and listen to a man singing opera on the street, it was utterly beautiful and i decided i needed to meet this person and learn his story too. we got to talking and several other people joined the conversation; two girls from europe and three men from the city. eventually we all parted ways and i decided it was time to contact my friend about coming over. only my friend never answered. i tried for about 30 minutes and waited in the same spot until the three men from earlier came back and asked if i had any plans for the rest of the night. i said i did but now im not sure, i might have to walk home. they offered to walk with me and handed me a bottle of rum they were drinking, said might as well have fun on the walk. thinking about how everyone i met to that point had been wonderful, and that i had a better chance at being safe walking with three men than alone, i obliged and took a drink. stupid. so stupid. after i was sufficiently liquored up they offered to get a taxi since i was having a hard time remembering the way home. they hailed one and i got in and thanked them, but they got in too. they then spoke to the driver in spanish and the driver started going somewhere i couldnt recognize. i asked where we were going and they told me, the jungle. at that point one of them was talking to the driver loudly while another started groping me. i did everything i could to stop him but i couldnt in my state. when we got to the jungle they all started groping. i fought back as hard as i could, i tried everything to get away. after i was effectively beaten to an utter pulp one pulled out a knife, another a gun. i stopped fighting back. they raped me for 6 hours before someone finally heard and investigated. i grabbed what i could of my things at that moment and made a run for it, getting to the closest populated area i could to wait for a taxi. when i went to the hospital a few hours later, after having passed out immediately upon arriving home, i realized just to what extent i was hurt. every. single. inch. of my body was bruised or cut and covered in blood. i filed a report and had a kit done, then they gave me a gallon bag of medications that would help me to not get an std. i was able to gather later, when talking to the police, that they were in a gang. my best guess is ms13 from the things they said and what they called each other. when the dna tested positive for two wanted individuals i asked them to confirm my suspicion, but they said they could only confirm they were in a gang and not which one specifically. because of that and the fact that they still had my camera and had access to my wallet and i. d. for so long i did not go through with the court case. i legally changed my name, moved, and tried to move on. its been many years since that night now, and ive been through therapy and am happy to say i no longer suffer from symptoms of ptsd, but i definitely know better than to expect the best from people i meet now. to the men who almost destroyed my life and beat me within an inch of death, lets not meet. ever.

[SEP]	that would be 1819. lady ada lovelace (the inventor of the first working mechanical computer) started working on it in the 1830's. i would find her and charles babbage and explain all the advances in computers and softward and hardware (i.e transistor design) in general. i am an electrical engineer with 25 years experience in digital vlsi design and audio signal processing. after teaching them knowledge that wouldn't be known for 150 to 200 years, i would leave with them the working example of a computer more powerful than they could dream of, the smart phone. i would tell them to keep it safe, until technology develops that they can effectively reverse engineer it (though i already would have given them a high level overview of how it works , from the rf front end to the back end application processor). i would also give them a high level overview of the manufacturing process for such a device. i could teach them how to make a dc power supply to keep the iphone charged but i don't have the specs on the recharge connector protocol, so it is not as simple as making a dc power supply and then your done. my hope is that i advance technology by a hundred years. however the best that can hope for is a few decades because advancement in one technology requires advancement in other technologies, some of which i have no expertise in. this is like how the ancient greeks discovered the basic steam engine, but this didn't cause the industrial revolution to happen a 2000 years earlier because the metallurgy required to make vessels that could withstand the high pressures of a working practical steam engine would not be invented for hundreds of years. also if ada lovelace was hot, i would try to fuck her. edit: 1) my wanting to fuck her doesn't negate the truth of all the technical stuff said before. 2) to those saying she's 4 years old, i implied that while i would arrive in the world when she was 4, i wouldn't meet her until she started working on the computer, which would put her at ~20 yrs of age. 3) though i'm married , 1833 < 1999. so according to temporal boner logic, its not cheating. edit2: 4) yes some of you are right: she didn't technically invent the computer; her collaborator charles babbage did that. she programmed the machine though. so hardware: babbage , software: lovelace. 5) some of you state that i the charging protocol is not complicated and that my dc power supply would work. but i think others correctly point out that only applies to the old usb connectors. this won't work with the lightning connector on a modern iphone.

[SEP]	"i arrive 200 hundred years in the past, if we go from direct location i am in the upper west side of manhattan in 1819. my office space is now a farm of a rich resident within the city. after talking to them for awhile, i will set out to find robert fulton. i am about to invest or work on his uss ontario, the first steamboat to travel between ny and ohio. i invest in that shit, rail roads, and mills (where they make cloths) and become a robber baron during the dawn of the industrial revolution (i give people reasonable time off, and breaks each day, so everybody loves me) . with my new cash, and the ability to predict the future, i use my money to go on a few year long vacation. i immediately head to illinois why may you ask. to kill indians, nope. i need to find a young abraham lincoln, who at this point is like 20 and just started becoming a local lawyer. i talk to him for hours pretending to be a client needing representation. we become friends, and then i head down to maryland. i begin to purchase large amounts of slaves, with the plan to move them out west and free them starting a black commune (possibly in california where we find gold, and an easy access to income in the sacramento valley about 2 decades before the gold rush) where they are able to have a job, receive education (most slaves couldnt read) and live in the relative freedom. i try to buy as many slaves as possible however, i am looking for a specific young african american. a polymath and possibly the smartest guy in american history not named benjamin franklin, fredrick douglas. i find him, he's about 10, i free him, and send him to oxford to school those assholes. then after all this, i start investing in oil, i hire a young rockefeller to run the books, then i get jp morgan to help manage my railroad empire. and last but not least, at 50 as the civil war begins to dawn, i tell my proteges abraham lincoln and fredrick douglas to handle the situation (i also tell abe to watch out for fords theater) and then i head off to the ottoman empire. the empire is failing and i am willing to make a huge investment if they give me saudi arabia. they are desperate and oil hasnt been discovered there yet so i get what i wish. i also ask them to create a country for the armenian people, they do. after that i create a democracy in the model of the us in saudi arabia. i reach out to the us, and we become allies, normalizing american and the muslim worlds around a hundred years before we actually do. then i head to the congo fuck the belgians, i am taking this bitch over. no hands or dicks will be cut off in the name of rubber. i still make a killing on rubber. bang im back in the us the civil war is over and abe is dead (he didnt watch out for fords theater). with a large black coalition i am elected to congress where i continue reconstruction for forty years after it ended in this reality. race relations are good in the us. after an incredibly successful and long congressional run where i speed up the suffrage movement (and tell the daughters of the confederacy to fuck themselves) . as a 90 year old man, i invest in electric cars (thomas edison, tesla, the lumiere brothers, the wright brothers, and percy lavon julian have worked for me there entire lives) as my final frontier. we reverse advertise electric cars, making oil cars seem girly and that antisemitic asshole henry ford never makes a dime because i developed the assembly line forty years before he was born. with billions of dollars i die happily surrounded by my family. i give everything to the commune, the congo, and saudi arabia and leave a small portion for my family and close friends. in a portion of my will there is very specific instructions. as the new (20th) century dawns a trusted family member opens a safe. in the safe there are instructions to operate a strange square device. it hasnt been turned on since i arrived to this time. my son turns the phone on, the instructions read ""the following underlined material is an address in austria, at this address lives a happy family. that family has a son, he is a baby and very cute. kill that fucking baby."" that baby is named adolf hitler. i win the game"	[SEP]	233

[CLS]	what's the best job for a lazy person?	[SEP]	i worked as a security guard for a few years. their policy was going around the perimeter of the plaza twice per shift. it took about 30 min each, and they dont care what you do for the rest of it. so really you're getting paid by simple scarecrowing around and scaring off potential beggars or hobos only an hr of your 8 hr shift. while it wasnt high pay, the expectations are so low that it sort of justified it. not all security areas are the same.

[CLS]	what's the best job for a lazy person?	[SEP]	i worked at a pool the summer after my senior year of high school. i wasnt a lifeguard, i just had to have the person show me their navy card to get in the pool, and i had to check the ph levels of the pool at the end of everyday. only had to text my boss, could be on my phone the whole day, chilled with my then girlfriend, and ate food. didnt even have to clock out for lunch and got an extra half an hour every day. the down side was working in the hot sun, youd be under an umbrella but the job could get boring! edit: i should also add most of my friends were navy kids whose mothers or fathers were working so i would be able to chill with them all day too because it was their neighborhood. all in all pretty good gig if youre lazy edit 2: also one time me and my friends were there and there was a live skunk in the pool filter. he was trying to swim so we took a pool net and gently pushed him into it and let him down in the grass outside he was just laying on his back panting frantically then he jumps up and runs in the woods. i have it on film on my old iphone edit 3: wow 1.6k more people liked this job than i thought, guys you really dont want to work at a pool lmao	[SEP]	2150

[CLS]	what's the best job for a lazy person?	[SEP]	you can grow up on a farm, and then join the navy because you think it's less work than farming. they'll want you to do a lot of work at the naval academy, however, which you can get out of by studying lots of math so the leadership will think you're a geek with geek potential rather than a jock with command potential. then they'll offer you a chance to fly a plane, because you can't be stupid and fly a plane and everyone knows you're good at math. but flying a single-man plane is lots of work, you have to be at 100% all the time you're in the air, so you can transfer to *big* planes with multi-man crews and co-pilots, and since all your co-workers really want to transfer *out* of big planes because they're not flashy and heroic, you keep getting promoted and promoted until you're the first person in your class to make captain. eventually since you know everything there is to know about big planes, by being the only officer in the entire navy who's flown them for an entire career, you start inventing new stuff that makes even less work for yourself. stuff such as autopilots and navigation assistants. then a war breaks out, and you figure the safest thing to do is to fly rescue missions in your flying boat picking up downed fighter pilots, which paradoxically allows you to garner decorations for heroism. then after the war you retire honorably as a junior admiral, known for your amazing exploits as the man too lazy to fail.

[SEP]	"let's think about this realistically. the title stipulates the animal be ""100% friendly and loyal,"" which is assumed only to extend to you, the owner. we'll also assume op meant the animal was automatically domesticated to a reasonable extent. however op doesn't mention any secondary attributes of the animal - here are some criteria we must consider before making this fateful decision. is the animal territorial? prone to attacking others? is the animal mentally dependent on social structures? does the animal require a specific diet/large amounts of food? does the animal have a penchant for marking territory with offensive bodily odors? what is the animal's circadian cycle? does the animal exist? (looking at you, dragon people) does the animal require a specific climate/environment? can the animal adapt to confinement? does the animal enjoy destroying your house? (looking at you, tickles) does the animal shed? does the animal hibernate? is the animal's disposition affected by the biological prerogative? does the animal urinate/defecate without discretion? does the animal have behavioral triggers incompatible with modernity? therefore, looking at the criteria, we can confidently conclude that the only reasonable choice is. **drumroll*\* **a polar bear** because fuck it; it's a goddam polar bear."

(edit4: for the record, i'm 99% sure having a bald eagle as a pet in the us is illegal, unsure about a golden eagle.) absolutely no doubt a freaking eagle (if an elephant is not available). i mentioned this in the elephant comment above, but i was surprised no one mentioned it below. * 30-40 useful year lifespan (in captivity, in the wild normal lifespan is 15-20 years, oldest found in the wild was 32 years old), but can continue living for years to come with my help. (after that timespan they lose the ability to hunt effectively and flying becomes more taxing, but the can still live with help.) * eagle therefore badass * eagle vision can find things that i can't see * eagle vision can lead me on hikes and or help with search and rescue * eagle can hunt for me if i get hurt in wilderness. * eagles are regal af * eagle can retrieve any lost balls/frisbees on roofs * eagle would take awesome go pro footage. ""oh you have a drone, yeah that's old school, i have an eagle, it lasts all day."" edit: it could also be my source of income. falconers at airports make a good deal of money chasing away birds, similar jobs exist everywhere and are very specialized. edit2: as for limiting a beautiful bird from exploring, absolutely not. since the eagle would be 100% loyal to me, (and i would assume we would have some sort of understanding), i could simple tell it to go off and do what it needs to do, and come back when it's done. being 100% loyal, it absolutely would. hopefully, it would choose to nest on my property, and teach its children to also trust me, therefore i'd have an entire brood of loyal eagles. muhahahaha"	[SEP]	74

[SEP]	i wanted my hair cut very short. i keep it short now, clipped #1 on the sides and #2 on top. back when this happened i think i asked for a #3 clipper on the sides and finger thickness on top, blended to the sides. she picked up the clippers and popped in a #1 blade and went right over the top of my head like a reverse mohawk and then said 'oops, you wanted a 1 on top right?'. i had to get it #1 all over. this was the day before my friend's wedding that i was going to. i looked like a goon.

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	i have really thick hair with natural wave, i also have cancer. over the past couple of years while i've been battling i have had a really hard time getting haircuts because stylists can't seem to face cutting my hair. first haircut after diagnosis, my hair was well past my shoulders and i asked for a pixie cut. when she was done it was still way too long so i asked her to go shorter, she trimmed a lot more and i gave up and said ok. it was still 8 inches long on top and she didn't use clippers. it made a huge mess when it fell out a couple of weeks later. first haircut after finishing chemo the first time my hair had gone curly. my stylist trimmed the absolute minimum she could, i looked like an old lady with a perm. i asked her to go shorter around my ears so it had more shape to it and she said no because it grows slower there. she also would not use clippers. i cried because i hated it so much. second haircut, now back in chemo so my hair was thinning a bit. my husband got a stylist to come to our house. again i asked for a pixie cut, again i had to ask her to go shorter, again no clippers even though i specifically asked for them. last haircut, couldn't face another stylist so i took my husband's clippers to my own head. i made a mess and my husband helped clean it up. now i have a sloppy asymmetrical pixie cut and i am happier with it than any of the others. still not sure what i'm going to do when it needs trimmed again.

[SEP]	my hairdresser and i had a pretty good relationship, and i had short hair that i wasnt emotional about, so she asked if she could just go wild and surprise me. when i saw the result, id ended up with a weird uneven pixie cut. i told her that it was very cool, but would be too difficult to maintain every day, so could she please cut it down to a regular hairstyle. she redid the cut uncomplainingly, and i walked out happy.

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	im a guy and have long hair. i usually go to a female hairdresser at a salon but i had recently moved to a new place and found this highly rated barber shop that did cuts and shaves and i decided to give it a chance. i called ahead and asked if anyone there was comfortable cutting long hair and if so to make me an appointment with them. i went in with my hair about halfway down my back and said i wanted it just above my shoulders. the big thing was it had to be long enough to be pulled back and out of my face (it was necessary for my work). this guy nods and proceeds to start cutting just below my ears. my hair is curly and so curled up even higher as soon as he let go. he got about halfway around my head cutting a straight line before my expression made him go get someone else. the only female at the shop came over and audibly gasped. she tried to fix it but it was terrible. had to wear a bandana or hat at work for the next 3 months while it grew back out. the manager asked and i told him i was very disappointed and that they should have just admitted they dont do that kind of cut upfront. oh and they gave me a $5 discount and told me to please come again -_-	[SEP]	1961

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	when i was a young teen, 15 or 16, i had hair down to my belly button. i wanted it cut to my collar bone because my hair is thick and hard to take care of. my normal hairdresser was delayed into our appointment due to one of the dying hair things breaking and the other being taken so i was paired with a different one. this girl couldn't do an even cut. she kept trying. so she kept cutting so one side would be 3+ inches longer than the other. i watched in the mirror in horror, speechless. she eventually sees my face and goes to get my normal hairdresser. my normal hairdresser just gives me a sad look and says she has to even me out and that she was sorry. she had to cut it to my ears. she didnt ask if i like it. she just said i didn't have to pay. my eyes were watering by that point. it was horrible. never went back.

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	this only happened to me once. i'm not sure how she did so badly on my hair. it was all weird and uneven and she missed parts which is hard to do when you're just getting a classic crewcut. she was super young though so maybe it was a lack of experience. i politely told her no this wasn't going to work but it was going to be ok. i got up, paid and left her a tip (she did her best). then i drove down the street to another hair place and had someone there fix it. hopefully she either got better at her job or chose a different career path. i now no longer go to great clips or any of those types of quick haircut shops. i go to the same stylist over and over which is fun because it's like we're having these long conversations with month long gaps between them. plus she gives me a beer each time i sit down to get a trim.

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	my hair is pretty short so there's not much to mess up. i get it cut often cuz my hair grows thick and i have to maintain it for the military, so i tend to go wherever i can get in quick and cheap. i like it really short on the sides; like if lacroix cut hair, that level of hair-to-scalp ratio. just a hint. but the last time, i was out of state and stopped by a rinky dink little barber shop. after i got it cut, the lady flipped me around to look in the mirror (i was facing away) and it looked like almost none was cut off. so i asked her to cut more, and she reluctantly agreed. once again it was way too long. so finally i just told her 'just cut it all off' because now i was not only fed up with my thick hair, but my haircut experience. finished up and left. i still left with it longer than i normally like it.

[SEP]	after years of wasting money on horrible to unsatisfactory haircuts, i invested in a good clipper set, watched a few youtube videos and trim my own hair now. my initial thought was, if i mess it up, a) at least it won't be paying someone for it, and b) i can always do a crew cut 3 years later, best $30 investment ever. went from decent to pretty good at cutting my own hair.

[SEP]	"oh man. this happened to me just last month. i was growing out a pixie and my front hair was down to my chin, and the back was halfway down my neck. i wanted a trim at the back so it could even out with the front hair and look more like a very short bob. now, my fatal mistake was going to a brand spanking new salon. i figured that since i only want a trim from the back, it shouldn't be that hard for any stylist, right? wrong. she fucked up so bad. i swear, she just picked the scissors and went snip in straight lines, like how someone that doesn't know how to cut hair at all would do it at home. i explicitly told her 3 times i want a trim just from the back. she started from the back, and before i knew it, she'd come to the sides and snipped them off. i still remember my growing feeling of dread lol, that okay maybe she's just making it all even. but no. around a couple inches gone of all my hair that i tried so hard to grow out. she went in to blowdry, i stopped her and went home. ugly-cried. took a picture of the back of my head and ugly-cried some more. sent it to my boyfriend, who convinced me to go right up there and ask for a refund. went back, the stylist kept arguing with me that ""a trim means we cut off all the hair, not just the back"" even after agreeing that i told her explicitly that back only. she called her manager, who offered a refund of what's equivalent to roughly $3 (3rd world country). i told her i want $8 or i'm not leaving. i looked like a damn mushroom and told her so. she silently surveyed me, then took out $8 and said ""we're so sorry"". i left and went to one of the most top salons in the city and got another pixie that i love. its still kind of hard growing it all out again when i wasn't mentally prepared to go short again, but it's all okay. https://imgur.com/nrgzwqc.jpg here's a picture right after she cut it and i went home."

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	literally a few weeks ago, and my 30 year old ass cried. i did what i now know to be a mistake; went to an unfamiliar hair stylist to have my hair colored. i hadn't colored my light brown hair in a few years and wanted to add some dimension with highlights and lowlights. i pulled up a lot of reference photos, the hair stylist seemed to understand what i wanted, and she got to work. i should have realized something was wrong when she only put about 18 foils in my hair. i have pretty fine hair, but in the past stylists have used way more than 18 foils. unfortunately i had taken my glasses off for the appointment, so my vision was 80's level standard definition and i couldn't really see what was happening. when she finally started to dry my hair (i said i wanted some texture and she round-brushed it straight.) i put my glasses back on and saw stripes. blonde and red stripes in my ashy brown hair that started a quarter inch from my scalp. i would have been very on-trend in the late 1990's. amid my flashbacks to spice girls and butterfly hair clips, the stylists asked if i liked it and i just sat there agape like a catfish. she repeated the question and the other stylists and customers started side-eyeing me, and the intense focus mixed with my inability to lie caused me to start to break and the tears started. the head stylist swept over like a tall, beautiful superhero and pulled me to the back before i could make a scene. she looked over my hair and let me (quietly) get my frustrations out before insisting on fixing it. she put in more color, more depth, touched up the roots the last stylist left undyed, and styled it in textured waves. it looked much better, but still not really what i wanted. i'm trying to do it right this time by trying out other stylists for smaller things like trims and styles before deciding to color again. edit: grammar	[SEP]	86

[SEP]	about 2 years ago, i was looking for a new barber and decided to try out a shop near my work that's been around for years. small place that had a solid 4 stars on yelp. so i got my cut, gave it the okay (the lighting in there was low for the sake of ambience), and headed off to a soup kitchen where i volunteer. i then spent the whole afternoon getting the piss taken out of me by homeless dudes (and we're not talking light homeless dudes here, but super homeless folks who, as you can imagine, don't have great grooming regimens) for my messed up fade and the hairs sticking out of my head in random places. in a move that went against every grain of my conflict avoidant being, i called the shop up when my shift was over, explained that i wasn't happy with my cut, and asked them to make it right. they agreed. but when i went back, i had to sit in another barber's chair, explain to him point by point why i thought the cut was awful, and then i had to sit there as he fixed it while my original barber sat just feet away from me glowering. 10/10 would never do again.

[CLS]	people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	[SEP]	i didnt say i didnt like it. i was too afraid of the comb. i was probably 12 or 13, and the person who had cut my hair since i was little was changing careers, so i needed a new person to cut my hair. so the next time i need a haircut, my grandmother takes me to this shop near her house. the lady overall was fine. she seemed nice enough. i did notice some of the teeth of her comb were missing or broken, but i didnt think much of it. oh boy. when she started combing my hair, it was like she was trying to shove the comb through my skull. its not like i had tangled or unkempt hair, she apparently just thought proper combing technique included pushing the teeth of the comb against my head with all her might. she was making some comment about me having dandruff or something and that i needed to wash my hair more often while doing this, and when i finally flinched she said see? your scalp is tender. no, actually, youre using that thing like a weapon. when i got done, she had basically given me a bowl cut. she asked me if i was happy with the cut (i will give her that, she didnt do the thing some adults do when dealing with children and defer to the parents, ignoring the child completely), because youre the customer, what matters is if youre satisfied. i didnt particularly like it, but i didnt want her to use the comb on me again, so i said yes. and we never went back there again.

[SEP]	this is on a related note, but i once told a stylist not to touch my hair. it was at a paul mitchell school. i've gone to the school here in the past many times, but i guess it's only been recently that they've just started letting student stylists in without any kind of skills, abilities, competence, or anything. i don't know why they would let them on the floor. i noticed this at toni and guy schools as well. i don't go to schools any longer to get my hair cut. now i'll just pay good money and leave a good tip at an actual salon. anyways, i digress. i came in for a haircut last year to the paul mitchell school. i'm a woman and have a really easy hairstyle, it's moderately short and not a lot of layers of anything. i requested for a stylist to just trim my hair so it would grow out evenly. a student senior stylist comes out to shake my hand and i notice that she barely speaks english. she seems uncertain, shaky, and like she doesn't have a clue about what she's doing. she then takes me back to get my hair washed. she doesn't wet my hair thoroughly and proceeds to shampoo my hair when it isn't even wet. we then get back to the floor, and she starts separating my hair out into sections. after stabbing me with the pins and pulling out my hair, i told her to stop and that i wasn't comfortable letting her cut my hair. i felt terrible, and this was the only time i ever did something like that. a class instructor gives me a hair trim, and it took him less than 5 minutes. i was out the door. i tipped the woman, anyways, but i realize now i just should have given it to the instructor. what a weird and awful experience. now i will easily pay $50+ for a good haircut, because that kind of mess just isn't worth it to me. sometimes there's really good student stylists, but i'd rather not take the gamble.

[SEP]	"finally, a chance for my story. even though i'm late and no one will read it. this was about 20 years ago. i was visiting baltimore for a month, staying about 45 minutes outside of town in pikeville. i needed a hair cut, so found sam's barbershop in the phone book within walking distance, advertising $5 haircuts (first red flag). i went there, and it was downstairs in anything hair salon (2nd red flag). i found it downstairs, and there was no one else there (final red flag). sam was older, but nice, so i sat down and he started cutting and talking. he proceeded to tell me about his life, including how he emigrated from poland as an adult to avoid hitler. i did some quick mental math, figuring out he had to be (at the youngest) in his very late 80's. i also began to notice he had to hold himself steady with one hand, while cutting with only one hand. this meant he couldn't pull the hair up or anything between his fingers, he could just hack away with scissors. i tried to mentally signal my wife to pull the fire alarm, but she just read her magazine. i then just resigned myself to my fate, and listened to his story. to quote bill from king of the hill, ""it's only hair. it'll grow back."" he finally finished. he didn't ask what i thought, but i said thanks, and gave him $5, plus a $2 tip, which by his reaction was the first tip he'd gotten in about 40 years. i drove straight to the next barbershop i saw, and when i walked in the barber's eyes got really wide for a second until he could regain his composure. i said ""it's a little uneven, to which he replied you think?"". i asked him to do what he could, so he cut it down to about 1/4 inch on the sides, and about 1/2 inch on top. cost me another $20, but at least it was even. all in all, an interesting day. i was out of town, and enjoyed the low maintenance cut. if my head weren't so lumpy and irregular, i might have kept it. plus, it was quite a treat to hear a first hand account of someone evading hitler. 8/10, would do it again. and it did, in fact, grow back."

""i guess you'd have to take it all down to the same level, huh?"" i say. the dude panics, turns to the woman next to him, who just gives us the *what the fuck happened* look and shoos him off of me. she studies it for a while and basically says that she'll try and salvage it as best she can, but it's going to be pretty different. after a few minutes, it looks a bit like [gary oldman](https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/system/images/photo_albums/gary-oldman/large/14-oldman-thefifthelement.jpg?1384968217) in the 5th element mixed with [macklemore](https://www.respectmyregion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/macklemore.jpg). she swears that it's up and coming as a professional look, and i just sort of side eye her and sigh and say ""let's just take the rest of it off. we tried."" i get the shortest buzz cut i've ever had in my life, but hey, it ended up being free. &#x200b; anyway, i meet up with my friends for a drink; all the guys had a massive laugh at my expense, all the girls were horrified for me, my girlfriend was caught somewhere in between. and she became my fiancee a month later, when my hair grew back in."

[CLS]	what trend did you follow as a kid that makes you cringe now?	[SEP]	sagging my pants because a kid told me you dont have to wear them that high and i was afraid of being bullied for high waters after that, thinking that my clothes had to have a polo (couldnt be uspa) logo on it, or be plastered with abercrombie & fitch, aeropostale, american eagle (still wear their jeans though lol i love the stretch ones they make) or hollister logos all over it for it to be considered swag. also, my obsession with jordan shoes, often dreaming of the day id be able to buy 100s of them. i was so obsessed with trying to dress a certain way to appear trendy. now i couldnt care less about that stuff lol. i rock clothing from wal mart (those color assorted t shirt packs are great lol) and h&m and until my shoes (usually vans) give out entirely, imma keep wearing them. its all fun when your parents are spending their money but as i got older, i realized i didnt have money to be wasting on useless stuff like a jordan collection right now lol. bonus: i was one of the many people that dyed their hair like odell beckham when he first came into the league. didnt even know who he was at first, thought he was a linebacker but he had cool hair so i got it just like his (blonde curly mohawk thing). i was the first one at my school to do it and people thought it was the coolest thing lol, then it caught on (kids asked me how i did it and were telling me i looked like odell) and almost every boy was walking around with blonde dyed hair later that year in my school lol.

[SEP]	that jobs arent as stable as they used to be. were making way less money than before, its exponentially harder to find a job, and the expectations for the average applicant keeps rising. were now asked to constantly be on call to come back into work. remember that day off you looked forward to all week? nope, boss called you in. you dont show up to said call-in because you arent going to work unless its overtime pay? youre fired. need to find another shitty job for shitty pay. set schedules are never a thing anymore (at least in my experience. even at my research internship i would constantly get called in on weekends when it was stated before that i wouldnt work weekends). were expected to be the most efficient, mindless, obedient generation of citizens and workers. it sometimes seems like were never doing anything because were just so goddamn exhausted that even doing daily tasks is a struggle. were asked to constantly be working efficiently even away from work. rest isnt a thing anymore. our generation is getting burnt out and sick of the issues that order generations dumped on us, yet were blamed as the ones who caused the problems. op keeps asking what solutions we can bring, and the only thing i can think of that will really solve the countrys financial problems is to just wait for the boomers to die off. its a bit morbid to say but its true. theres just too many people and not enough money to go around. unfortunately the younger generation (millennials, genz) has to bear the burden of 2008s economic clusterfuck. sorry for the rant. edit: this blew up holy shit. some naysayers replying to me saying im asking for too much or i should be grateful im working. i am grateful to work. is it too much to ask that my life and my work have stability? the older generation had a lot of stability and consistency in their jobs. we dont get that luxury. yes ive worked retail but that was before i declared my chem major. i now work at a small research lab and have a side job as something to do during the summer so im not bored. its not that i want handouts (and quite the opposite i want to earn what i get), its just that i want to be able to know that i wont be laid off at the drop of a hat because my boss decided to spam my inbox and voicemail demanding me to come in when we specifically agreed for weekends off as i got the job. unless its overtime compensation im not showing up. any reasonable person would agree with me on that. /rant part 2	[SEP]	1755

[SEP]	"i've been at my current company for nearly six years now, in that time i've been promoted once and my salary has increased nearly 60%. that's makes me a massive exception among my circle of friends. most of them graduated around the same time as me (about 7 years ago) and are on their third or fourth job, one of them is starting his fifth job in six years after the summer. one guy spent three years at a job because they kept telling him he needed to put in the time in order to get promoted. when he finally left he had gotten two raises of 1.5% each in those three years, and his older colleagues said he was leaving ""for the money"" because his new job offered him 15% more than what he was earning. even when he took that offer to his boss he still didn't get offered the promotion they promised him when he started there. the reason millennials aren't loyal to companies anymore isn't because we're out for ourselves, it's because companies have been systematically abusing the expected loyalty to string employees along, nickel and diming them every step of the way."

[CLS]	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	[SEP]	despite what news networks or studies say generations can vary greatly. i was born in 96 but am considered a millennial where i'm from because it's all back woods and technology gets here a little slower. if i was in a city in a more advanced area i'd be gen z. i had chalkboards in elementary school, whiteboards and a few smart boards in middle school and then back to white boards in high school. computers were put in my school when i was in 5th grade. i saved to a floppy disk. i know what it feels like to take a big rubber dodge ball to the face. you kind of get the point. we don't expect things to be handed to us, we just want affordable access to things. my parents were able to buy a house at 19 and support two children on a full time and a part time income. granted it was a struggle sometimes. i'm 23, work about 80 hours a week (it varies based on staffing), plus go to school and can't afford rent in my area. my current job did require education already. i can't afford to go to the doctor despite working in healthcare. we aren't lazy like the news says, we work our assess off just to get nowhere. i have three days off this month, plus school. those of us who don't want children don't hate children, we know we can't afford to raise them. we are inheriting a fucked up economy, a dying plant and get nothing but shit because were just lazy and entitled. not to mention in the us were straight up getting our rights taken away. were pretty angry about it. edit: shit man someone gave me silver. thanks! y'all are just trying to make me blush now. i've never gotten awards and now i have 2!? now were on 3 guys. i'm starting to feel like i'm important or something. i can't keep up with you guys! thanks so much!

[SEP]	baby boomers screwed over the millennials big time. cheap primary, secondary and university education? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. once these people grew up, they wanted nothing to do with high taxes to support cheap university education, especially. so they drew up the ladder of educational opportunity and more or less said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us these great educational benefits without us taking on any student debt. so we got ours! now youre on your own! world-class infrastructure? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. well-kept highways, bridges, tunnels, and subway systems are for young people to use, not old people since most old people are going to be dead soon. bridges that are well-kept, for example? those last 50 years, and will mostly benefit the young. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us great infrastructure, but that means we have to pay higher taxes to keep this up. but we dont want to pay for that! now youre on your own! cheap housing in large cities bursting with economic opportunity? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. now that the baby boomers are old and have lots of property in these citiesespecially nice coastal cities like san francisco and new yorkthey dont want high-density anything because it destroys the character of the neighborhood. the worst of the worst nimbyist people are baby boomers who got in on this urban property pretty cheaply 40 years ago or so. and they want to keep those property valuations way up. so that means no high-density anything, which means crazy high property prices and very high rents. and who bears the burden of this? the young, the people trying to start their careers. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us cheap property in cities, but now we dont want our property values to go down, even a bit. so no to high-density development, no to apartments, no to affordable housing! now youre on your own! this is the harsh truth millennials must face: the old are screwing us, the young, big time. and the old dont like hearing this harsh, harsh truth because they dont like to see themselves as the bad guys who achieved much lower taxes after the 1980s by ruthlessly cutting back on things that benefit the young, the things they themselves enjoyed when they were whippersnappers. the national debt is zooming upwards, and we the young are going to be paying for that, not the baby boomers who will soon depart. the old are always the victims, but never the bad guys.

[CLS]	millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	[SEP]	"as someone on the older end of being a millennial who's managed to be fairly successful, while i will take credit for ""creating opportunity"" (being a go getter, skilling up, etc) fact is luck played as much if not more in my success. the days of simply being a professional and getting your degree resulting in a lucrative job are long gone. (not that you shouldn't do those things, just that used to be the finish line with a job at the end of it, now it's the starting line for a lot of careers) i will also say even my advice is probably already outdated to the point of no longer useful things have change so much, advice for the 50 and 70s is all but useless in modern times. toss into the pot it now takes two full time workers in decent paying jobs to buy an okay house and that's if you're in good health and manage to get lucky enough to get a decent job. (and that was before jacked up tuition rates and student loans killed that option) fact is while i'm a millennial those of us from 1980 to 2000 have had it leagues easier than those after 2000, and honestly i'm expecting things to get way worse before better. the sad fact is, if things don't change our future is looking really grim, yet we look at our parents living it up thanks to the situation they grew up in, and frankly we're jealous, frustrated, and upset, and yet we're looked down on as if we're to blaim for the shit show we've inherited, and when we try to come up with solutions we're told ""nope, you dumb kids are narcissists who just want hand outs"". i don't want a hand out, i want people who work 40 hours a week teaching to at least be able to not starve to death it some gutter, i think that's a pretty &$!?# low bar. yet even that appears to be too big an ask right now."

[SEP]	pastry chef here. as much as people say avoid specials, i can't speak for everyone but at least in desserts/breakfast pastries, if you see something new its worth trying. chances are it's something the chef has been working on for weeks on their own time, there's a lot of love and effort put into it. also, the standby if the menu is a book, it's probably not great. the biggest thing to keep an eye on though imo is the staff. if there's pissed off people, get out as fast as you can obviously. if everyone is kinda apathetic and not talking to each other much, get out. that's also a shitty environment, everyone is probably really passive aggressive, and that's going to show. if people seem genuinely good with being there even if it's busy or if there's playful ragging going on, that's where you want to be. the better the staff gets along, the better everthing in the place runs.

[CLS]	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	[SEP]	ive worked in restaurants for over a decade. a couple years in the kitchen and the rest as foh. if your servers response to how is the [item] seems disingenuous, thats a big red flag. we know what goes on in the kitchen, we know the complaints, and we know which items to stress over when we deliver them. servers who pause or seem uncomfortable with that question generally equates to a menu full of stuff we wouldnt eat even as a free shift meal. a good sign is when servers hang out and eat at the restaurant post-shift. generally we are getting a discount but not free food - if we are spending our nightly tips on it, its worth it. edit: woah, thanks for gold kind stranger!

[CLS]	chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	[SEP]	"cook at a fancy casual fine dining restaurant here. if your food is out impossibly fast, it's probably something to be concerned about. i'm talking ordering an entree and it's out in like 10 minutes. this usually means it's already been cooked and they just have to reheat it. now something like a salad, okay that shouldn't take any time at all, but you want to make sure your lettuce (or whatever green it is) is still crunchy and fresh, otherwise it's been made before and has been sitting. generally speaking, watch the wait staff. if the majority of them seem disgruntled or upset, things probably aren't great. this often translates to the kitchen so they probably don't care about your food if they aren't being treated fairly. another thing to look out for is the cleanliness of the place. if the restaurant seems dirty or unmaintained, the kitchen is in similar shape most of the time. i've heard people say ""never order the fish on a monday"" or ""don't get any specials because it's probably product that's about to go bad."" but at my restaurant that's not the case. we get orders all throughout the week and our specials are things we are playing around with to see if it could be added to the menu. so i would say just be cautious about that sort of stuff. also it helps to read reviews. i like to read the one star reviews to see why it was rated that way, if a majority of the reviews are for some really stupid shit, and all the other reviews are great, your likely going to get some kick ass food and service. you all know the ones i'm talking about. some karen who left a one star review because her water ran out once during a huge crunch or something else totally ridiculous. how does the place actually smell? does it smell like good food? then it likely is. does it smell like perfume or to sterile when these is clearly food on the tables? that could be a bad sign that they are trying to hide something less than pleasent. that's pretty much all i can think of at the moment. edit: okay since i didn't make it clear what i mean by ""insanely fast"" and i'm getting a lot of push back. yeah. average ticket time should be about 15 minutes. i was maybe being a bit overzealous with the 10 minute turn around, but i was thinking of large tickets when the place is slammed or it just feels like your food came out very quickly."

""don't order fish on a monday"" ""specials are made with leftovers or food that's going bad"" ""if the toilets are dirty, the kitchen is too"" ""chefs bleed into your food"" &#x200b; it really depends on the venue. any chef worth a shit is never going to serve bad fish, out of date meat or bleed into your food. the fish thing could be accurate some of the time, but works on the assumption that restaurants have purchased their stock in bulk the previous week, which is often completely false for smaller establishments. that, and the concept of well-done steaks being deep fried or shitty, older cuts of meat may have been true ten or fifteen years ago, but the culinary world has changed so much in the last decade with the rise of cooking shows and celebrity chefs that venues can't afford to cut corners or pull dodgy tactics like that with even mildly clued-in diners that know what they're eating."

[SEP]	ive done bartending/waitressing for a few years, heres my list: - first of all, ignore the bathrooms/kitchen thing, the people in charge of the kitchen generally arent in charge of the bathrooms, and its normally the servers job, if the restaurant area is busy were gonna skip that when we can, but well probably give it a quick tidy if we use the toilets. - most places opt for paper menus, because they can just be chucked away afterwards, its cleaner this way, however if the table is sticky (and the restaurant area is quiet) then theres probably a few other sticky areas. - check your cutlery, most cutlery barely gets washed, it gets rubbed with soap, sprayed with water and chucked in a dishwasher, its then meant to be polished with hot water when its brought to the table set up area, this is where we actually check it for leftover grime. if your cutlery is gross, chances are your wait staff arent doing their job properly - dont order fish on sundays, most places get their fish deliveries on a monday and on a thursday, fish goes off fairly quickly and on a sunday its really not great. - if your server has long hair and its not tied up check for hair in your food, kitchens tend to have really strict rules on their staff and you rarely see them with hair down and makeup on, if theres a hair in your food its probably from your waitress. - if your (hot) food is out quickly your chef was probably a microwave - if your server visibly has a cold and is still working, dont eat there, theyre either not paying their staff enough to have days off or theyre forcing staff to work in conditions where they shouldnt be handling food, the kitchen staff probably get the same treatment and probably have the same illness	[SEP]	1306

[SEP]	"the girls in our elementary school were given proto-sex ed before the boys. the basic puberty stuff, your body is starting to change, you might develop breasts, sweating, all that stuff. they made a huuuuuuuge stupid deal about keeping it quiet. it's the girls' little secret. don't go spreading it around school. (it only occurs to me now that that. is kinda dangerous in the wider scope of things.) anyway, my best friend was a boy and naturally, i skipped right off to tell him why suddenly half the class had an assembly all by themselves. my teacher heard about it, got me alone, grabbed me by both arms and shook me. ""keep your mouth. shut."" she was my favorite teacher up til then. totally a great thing to teach a kid."	[SEP]	11913

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	so when i was in kindergarten i didnt make it to the bathroom in time and wet myself. went to the nurses office got new clothes but instead of panties i had to wear a pull up, not a big deal. i guess it was a school policy for kids my age i dont really know. when i get back to my class my teacher loudly says oh good the baby is finally back or something like that. she also knew about the policy and asked if i was wearing a diaper so every other student could hear. i was 5 and felt a ton of shame and humiliated. i started crying and trying to get out of school a lot because of it. my teacher often referred to me as a baby for the rest of the year. also she would constantly ask if i needed to potty or if i was wearing a diaper, like i was a toddler or something.

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	"so back in 1st grade i was at this private school and despite not enjoying reading i actually loved school and had a ton of friends and it was great, got along with everyone. one day my sister stayed home sick and my parents dropped me off and as i was walking in i said hi to the nun that taught the other 1st grade class. she said hi and i kept walking. as i was approaching the end of the hall she dropped her keys, i heard so i turned around and looked, in between her and i were 2 4th grade boys i recognized from my sisters class. they started to approach her to pick up her keys when she lost it and started screaming at me, that i was rude and awful and some other terrible not so non like things. the boys were confused, i was confused, they were closer, and going to help but she was furious that i didnt help her. i got pulled out of class to talk to the principal that day, between her and the nun i really thought i did something horrible. i was punished and made to feel like i murdered this nun. when my dad picked me up that day i just started to sob, and i didnt stop until we got home and my mom and dad and sister held me. i was having a full blown panic attack, my moral values were being questioned and i was horrified at myself. my parents were furious and they called my teacher demanding to know what happened, all she said was she was unsure and that i seemed to have a run in with the nun. my parents went in the next morning for answers and we got an apology from the principal but not for the nun. and i remember standing at the counter with my big sister, terrified and sad and this nun walks in and says being rude to me again, my sister is standing there horrified, the front office secretary is shocked and my mom ripped this nun a new one. the nun hadnt seen my parents there. my parents went to the head father at this parish and read him the riot act, when he tried to defend the nun they went to our bishop, he clobbered the whole school. but by then the damage was done, i was a target to the nun, everything i did she had a problem with. i stopped being myself at school, i became very insecure and quiet. my sister and those boys took it upon themselves to check on me as often as possible, they became targets too. so at the end of the school year my parents pulled us and we went to a new school. i never got my confidence back. and in 6th grade a new boy joined our class, immediately i recognized him as being one of my best friends from 1st grade, he was in the nuns class. he immediately recognized me and his first words was ""damn sister thomas was a real bitch. huh?"" which for private school kids was a big deal to say. we ended up staying at the same school throughout high school and at graduation when our elementary school group got together for a picture he said ""you never really found yourself again after that. you should try to find it, you engage always been amazing you just gotta find it again"" so fuck you sister thomas you cunt."

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	"in the 8th grade i had a book report to do for 4 books all due on the same day that was way too overwhelming to do at the time. i had some serious domestic violence going on at home between my parents. spent all my time taking care of my younger brother, cleaning up the house, cooking, and crying from all the stress. it was worth 20% of my grade and the day before it was due, i broke down and told my teacher everything; down to the time when my brother bled from his head from being hit by my dad, to the most recent attempted murder upon my mom. if i had even recieved a b, my dad would've beat the shit out of my mom for giving birth to a stupid kid. he called child services, my parents recieved the call, and gave me the silent treatment for 3 days. they told him i lied just to get out of the assignment. the social worker told my teacher what my parents said and made the rest of my year a living hell. he treated me with such pettiness after that and threatened to call my parents whenever i had either spoken too loud in class, or whenever i was unparticipative in gym. he called my parents for my ""bad behaviour"". home life got significantly harder after that, and my parents told my entire family continuously how stupid i was for telling him. they laughed at me when i cried or got upset about it. years later after repressing everything i was diagnosed with severe ptsd from childhood trauma as a witness and victim of domestic violence, attempted murder thrice, and it took me 3 years in therapy to get over it - it was quick, but it was tough as it was during my university years and i ended up having to take an extra year of school to catch up mentally. i was ready to speak up about my struggles again when i couldnt function anymore as the traumatic flashbacks occured twice a week for hours at a time. i couldn't do a single thing except tremble and live in fear. i was 18 by the time i was ready to reach out for help. fuck you mr. gentle, your name is creepy as fuck, and i really do wonder if being a petty 33 year old to a 12 year old child made your quality of life better. i hope that there's proper procedures put in place to protect children from such experiences. edit: i did not expect for this to blow up! thank you guys for all your kind words and support. it's so sad to read some of your replies. in a way, im glad to know im not alone, but at the same time, it breaks my heart to know that this isn't a rare experience. i'm actually from canada and i thought i would give an update! i'm now 23, finishing up one more course to get complete my bachelors in business marketing. unfortunately things did not get better with my parents. my mother is still with my dad, and after finding out i had a so, their treatment was beyond ruthless. after one more incident, i left for good and have not had any contact since this october last year. yes, it is still fresh and it wasn't my first time leaving but this is definitely the last time. i was supposed to graduate at 21 but ive finally accepted that that is okay. the hardest part, though, was accepting that my relationship between my parents will never be healthy and leaving was the only thing i could do to save myself. for all you teachers out there or for anyone working with adolescents, take the time to listen. even if it's trivial, silly, stupid - you have the power to change their direction in life and give them the motivation to make the best out of themselves. i don't resent mr. gentle anymore, and making that phone call was all that he could've done. just don't become a teacher if all you're going to do is undermine them. your job is to guide them. even if nothing could have been done by the authorities, he didn't need to hold whatever i said against me, truth or not. it doesn't matter. if you need someone to talk to dont hesitate send me a message! life is fucking bullshit but im not going down without a fight lol"	[SEP]	8041

[SEP]	this professor giving a pointless class in college. my phone accidentally rang because i was waiting for a medical call, i interrupted him because of that. i apologized and said sorry, the asshole said sorry for your parents that pay your college fee, theyre wasting money. loud to everyone in the clase i had a huge urge to punch him but remained silent because i was changing career that semester and would not see him for another course anyway. he always got away with humiliating students with those types of comments for petty shit, everyone hated that asshole.

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	i had a professor for one of my theorized math courses that was a complete dick. there are three, specific experiences. background info: the class had no textbook, and we had only whatever he wrote on the board in lecture. even when it came to maple, which we were, apparently, required to know, even though in this course description it said intro to maple. 1. the homework was actually impossible, and we had quizzes on it, randomly. one time we had a pop quiz where the homework required for it was just undoable, because it was not related to lectures and not google-able. (senior-level, theorized, math courses) after the quiz, he asked, was there any questions on the homework/ quiz, so i raised my hand and asked, why do we have quizzes on things we dont cover, considering we dont have a textbook? (i was pretty mad at this point) his response was, i refuse to answer unless you rephrase the question to make it sound like it wasnt my fault, because its your fault for not understanding the material. i almost walked out of the classroom, but i knew that i couldnt ever miss anything, because he also didnt post his lecture notes anywhere. 2. one time, he told us of an upcoming quiz, and it was to basically figure out a proof about some theory that literally took 700 years for mathematicians to figure out; we had 4 days. i just didnt even show up to class. 3. this one irked me the most. i went to his office hours, and i apologized for making it seem like my question was his faultit was more of an actual question and not meant to have the intent of an attack on him; im a very blunt person. i asked if there was literally anywhere online or tutor wise in which i could get extra help. he told me that there was no textbook and that his lectures were all i needed. i was like ok, but clearly this stuff isnt working for me; you dont have any back-up plans for students that cant understand easily? (keep in mind, again, his lectures had almost nothing to do with the homework assignments, which stopped about halfway through the semester, so there was actually no way in teaching yourself this stuff.) he told me that he would not help me and to just study his lectures harder, so i left. overall, one of the worst professors, and humans, i have ever met. i can not believe someone of that manner and caliber was allowed to be a professor and was actual credible. i somehow got a c, and i surely dont know how anyone got an a. the classs grades were like 35% a, literally 1 b, 50% c, and the rest were below c.

[SEP]	in third grade i had a teacher tie me up to my chair and tape my mouth shut. i was a super smart and hyper kid who had just been prescribed prednisone for my asthma. which will make you crawl out of your skin. my original teacher died in the beginning of the year and we had 4 temps before ms keeney. she was 25 no degree and should not have been teaching. she screamed goddammit punkrockid and tied me up. i then wouldnt shut the fuck up so she taped my mouth shut. 28 kids laughed at me, one kid drew scissors from his desk and motioned to cut the chord. i remember making eye contact with sean and shook my head no. told my parents got switched out of the class and the teacher was fired. the other kids parents in the class threw the teacher a going away party because that kid and his brothers were always trouble other than my 3rd grade class ive told maybe 3 people about that. as ive gotten older it explains so much of some things in my life edit for spelling	[SEP]	256

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	not particularly traumatic (the first one, anyway), but i have two stories i'd like to share: the first is of a teacher in my secondary school who screwed over a lot of students' it gcses. she wasn't the worst teacher, she was actually very likeable. she, however, decided that instead of teaching the unit like she was supposed to, she'd just do the work at the front of the class and have all of us copy as she went. obviously this meant that everyone's work looked near identical to each other's. needless to say, her superiors found out and she was fired. oh, she also allegedly slept with a student at a prom a few years prior. the second story is a tad more personal, i'll keep it brief. i ended up having a thing for one of the teachers in my second year of college (i know, thin ice). i had a very positive relationship with her and even liked her enough to consider her a close friend, and i feel as though she held a similar sentiment toward me. i was never able to express myself properly when face to face with her (one time i tried to thank her for being so supportive and friendly to me and i accidentally thanked her for being 'pretty cool' instead, which she teased me for). so, near the end of the year she tells me of her plans to leave the country. she's going to sri lanka to teach kids english (it's all very noble). i learned of these plans in 2018, come easter 2019 and, well, we all know what happened in that country. i have never feared for someone's life before and, bearing in mind i hadn't (and still don't have) a way to contact her i was scared shitless of the possibility of something happening. thankfully i have no reason to believe anything bad happened to her due to monitoring the number of posts on one of her social accounts (a little stalkerish but i needed to know), but that shit fucks with you, especially when you don't expect it. edit: just added a sentence in parentheses	[SEP]	87
[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	in our school the football coach wanted me to play on the team, so in order to get me to play, he publicly embarrassed me for an entire class period, saying such things that i was a coward and had a yellow streak down my back. his angry ranting went on for an hour with the class sitting in stunned silence. he also stood in the doorway to prevent me from leaving the room. after that experience i had great difficulty with public speaking for years. i learned for the first time that monsters can be real. thankfully, he is now deceased from natural causes.

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	i had a math teacher who was also the track coach. one day during practice she was assigning people to events during an upcoming track meet. kids were saying what event they wanted to participate in and shed write their name/event on an index card then put it in her folder. well she left her folder open and you could clearly see that on the back of each index card shed written either fast or slow. a lot of kids were upset to see that they were considered slow and a bunch left the team after that because they felt bad about their efforts. the worst part is this was middle school and the stakes clearly werent that high, so she essential ruined it for us for no reason.

[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	when i was 14 years old i was accepted into an arts magnet school. it was a pretty big deal in the city that i grew up in. prestigious artists came in to teach young students that displayed promise, i guess. i was accepted into a creative writing department, one of only four freshmen to be accepted. it was the biggest deal of my life. within a few weeks this semi-famous and important 55 year old man began molesting me. in front of his classroom. in front of everyone. he didn't even bother trying to hide it. i was young and stupid and for awhile i thought that the attention meant i was special, and when i quickly realized how awful it was i felt like i couldn't do anything because everyone saw it and no one was stopping it. he made me believe, as a freshman, a 14 year old child, that men sexually touching a young girl in front of her peers was totally normal. so i stayed quiet for four months. my fingernails fell out. i began having intense panic attacks. i finally spoke out and he lost his job and the school attorneys advised my parents not to open up a legal investigation because they said it would further traumatize me. when i initially came forward the director of the school refused to listen to me. it was a nightmare. when i graduated school i moved out of the city and he found out where i lived and began stalking me. he ended up kidnapping me and taking me back to his home studio and showed me a shrine he made of me. he continued stalking me until my friend's weed dealer called him and threatened to murder him on his front lawn. it all stopped. i tried to move forward but it took seventeen years of suffering to finally go to the press. it was a complete fucking nightmare. i came out with my story a year ago and i am just beginning to get better. i'm going to college for the first time and i'm getting my life back on track. i haven't written anything substantial in the last 17 years because of his except some fan fiction because it's too painful and i'm still afraid to tap into those emotions.

[SEP]	22
[CLS]	what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	[SEP]	didnt happen to me but it still makes my blood boil. small town, one of my classmates in grade 10 english was dating the teachers best-friends daughter. he was a decent kid, well liked, he just had troubles in school and was a bit hyperactive. well, an untrue rumour had started earlier in the day that he had cheated on his girlfriend. by our block in the afternoon in grade 10 the rumour had been cleared up. apparently it was started in spite by a previous friend of the guy. anyways, apparently the teacher hadnt received the news just the content of the rumour. class starts and the teacher (who is a known bully) starts off by saying today you are going to hear a special piece of literature in order to comprehend the importance of spelling and grammar. immediately the hairs stand on up on the back of my neck. i was a shy kid and raised to do our best at respecting our elders but my mom was one to root for the underdog. i had this feeling, i just knew what she was planning to do, she was going for the jugular. and it didnt feel right. i stood up (kind of stunned with myself) and yelled you better stop this bullshit. picture the quietest easily bullied kid in your class saying it. the rest of the class didnt comprehended my intent and i froze or maybe they just wanted to witness the drama. anyways, i got a few shut the fuckups from classmates and the teacher chirps in yes please do, are you crazy? i look directly into the guys eyes and he mouths its okay. and i mouth im sorry. still frozen with tears in my eyes. in high sight i should have just ran to the office but i was scared. the teacher then proceeds to read out a very personal letter that she says is written by a guy to his girlfriend. it includes details about how the author was sexual abused by his step-father at 14 and the confusing feelings he had about the situation and thoughts of suicide. (this is the 1990s and sexual abuse wasnt well understood and the victim would sometimes be shamed for apparently wanting it. yes, i lived in the sticks.) she also intentionally stumbled at every grammatical and spelling error. she then turns to the guy and says see if you wanted to confess your feelings to your girlfriend, you should have edited first. the class bursts out laughing. the guy is just emotionally stunned. i didnt know how it impacted him and was too shy to even ask. and it just wasnt ever discussed. that kind of bullying was so normalized. and i stupidly worried id be in trouble too for failing him and worried nobody would believe me. and afraid id be bullied more. luckily the rumour mill didnt fly. he had good friends i guess. but, some kids would always tease him and say daddy wants a bj. years later drunk at our high school reunion he came up and asked if i could chat. he then proceeds to thank me for my kindness and apologize for never standing up for me. i said but i failed you. he said you didnt, you tried. he said that it was discovered the girlfriend had given the letter to her mom out of fear for his safety. and the teacher had taken it from her best friend (this lady was a bully to everyone). the teacher had since past away from cancer. to this day i sometimes wake up screaming stop stop you bitch. nobody will probably ever read this but glad i got it out. thanks for askreddit, it can be quite therapeutic.

[SEP]	my town. i've lived here for a few decades, and we used to be a relatively small area. we were the shopping center for the area (mall and a few department stores), so we were a little busy, but nothing too bad. really, it was nice being close to shit that we needed, but far enough away that everything was quiet. then, developers started cramming subdivisions into every open area they could. it's especially bad for me, because most of them are being added onto the two lane road that i leave my neighborhood on. when i was in elementary school, there was almost no traffic leaving my neighborhood in the morning. by the time i could drive, i had to find another route to go, because the exit to my neighborhood was backed up 1/4 mile every morning when i left. plus, my neighborhood was surrounded by woods, and now it's ugly as shit because they're just clearing it all for more houses. then, industry started moving in. amazon came in and bought up a bunch of warehouses. then, they started building more. it takes me forever to get to work in the winter, because they have to have cops manually do the traffic lights so amazon employees don't grind it to a halt. they also just cleared a shit ton of forest area to build a few more amazon warehouses, right next to where they cleared even more for more factories/warehouses. the traffic here is so fucking bad. i used to never really plan on hitting any, but now it's just a constant standstill everywhere. i have to tack on an extra 5-10 minutes to get to work. an extra 5-10 minutes to go to the store. coming back from class, an extra 15 minutes if i leave too late. plus, they're expanding some roads that will realistically only make things worse, so my whole area looks completely naked, because you can see stuff over a mile away now. i'm leaving the area as soon as i can. this place is just too ugly and congested.

[/u/jimthefeeder](https://www.reddit.com/u/jimthefeeder)) of women with their legs painted yellow. not the torso, not the feet, just the legs, and specifically the color yellow. it is named fedlegs because the fictional process for getting their legs yellowed is known as ""feeding the legs"" all in all, a very benign fetish, but the lore of the creator is what i think makes this a real contender. below are the highlights from the [stickied post on the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/fedlegs/comments/8xzk6a/fedleg_explanation_updated_due_to_expanding/) detailing his creation, implementation, and outcome of the ""leg feeding procedure"", along with the dr. fedleg universe, which is a parallel universe to our own.  wondered if it was possible to create a fetish from scratch. based on what i've read it's a mix of: light bondage, leggings, orgasm denial, and ownership/marking in the vein of the scarlet letter (i assume that's a fetish, i don't know if there's an exact term for it.)  he has an detailed universe of how the system works. who/why people get ""fedlegged"". mostly based on the kind of clothing they wear. if they've got their legs visible to be seen, they're getting ""fedlegged"".  in universe, everyone is aware of doctor fedleg, (full name charles fed ostrog), the person who got the process of leg painting legalized; he has the government's support. he developed sustainable clean/renewable energy which is why he's successful.  he never wishes to see women injured/beat/hurt during the process.  ""his reasoning is a mystery, but the one thing for certain is that it has nothing to do with religion."" - actual line in the writing.  on the 2014 midterm elections, prosecution for dr. fedleg was added onto the ballot; people voted against prosecuting him due to his successful ocean clean up act.  dr. fedleg has various kinds of paints that last certain durations. he also has a blend of the paint that can stop excessively revealing women, slutty, or rude women from having orgasms. dr. fedleg is the only person with permission to apply this special paint. regardless, i find the whole thing fascinating. what led to creation of the character? why create this universe to have it all work? why does dr. fedleg care about the environment so much? is it to be relatable to other people that might stumble across this, or is it the author inserting his own beliefs into the lore? why did he choose the 2014 midterm election? the post was written in july of 2018, so the closest upcoming midterm election would have been 4 months away, but he instead chose to go back to 2014, which i think would indicate he's been thinking about this for a while. in general i just have a lot of questions."

[SEP]	my brother is albino, hes been legally blind his whole life. as a family decision, suggested by a lady whose son also had bad eyesight, my oldest brother, mother, father and myself included would each take turns spending an entire day in his shoes. each sunday one of us would go all day armed with his walking stick and don a blindfold (no peeking whatsoever) doing normal day routines, going shopping, eating out, laundry, dishes, etc. even bathroom time was included. being young i was proud of myself upon completion-high fives and giggles (hard af ill admit, but mom was always near) by the time my dad finished his day his eyes were red and puffy, when he took the blindfold off he embraced my brother for a good while. everyone was silent, watching as my dad held my (then)nine year old brother by the shoulders, bending a knee and with his voice cracking he kept saying im so sorry im so sorry. id never seen my dad cry before, only when grandpa died did i see him just as broken. but i will never forget the day someone cried because they realized how much more terrifying everything suddenly became without the use of their eyes and how they truly empathized. it was just a day for us but this is life for him.

[SEP]	"might be too late but why not? legally blind, vision deteriorating throughout my life, got the ""legal"" designation in my early 20s. dating's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but there are a few things that help me appreciate someone intimately: 1. they don't spend the majority of the first date as a ""performance audit"" of how my vision might interfere with dating. it puts me on the defensive since i get half of those questions rephrased during job interviews and medical appointments. we met via [eharmony.com](https://eharmony.com/), not [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov/) =p 2. if they communicate about things openly but know what information isn't important at the moment. if someone goes ""radio silent"" in bed, i have no idea if i'm boring them, if they're unconscious, if they're having doubts about consent, or if i'm missing their favorite spot, and doubt is a hell of a mood-killer. however, if they're saying things like ""a little lower"" or ""don't you dare stop"", you better believe they have my undivided attention! 3. similarly, if time permits, foreplay is often an overlooked form of intimacy. not only is it arousing, but i'm also getting ""the lay of the land"" in the same way i'd use a cane if walking down the street. so yeah, quickies don't always work out if i'm trying to learn the layout of someone who wants to be gone in 10 minutes. don't rush it! 4. not gonna lie: breasts. i might not be able to notice them from afar, but if i'm with someone who's comfortable enough around me, they're my favorite kind of braille. \^\_- i'm open to chat for a while; if there're other questions. otherwise, i hope this helps! edit: my most upvoted comment is now about my sex life. fml. no, seriously, please do. i'm very lonely. i'll settle for a cuddle, at this rate. edit2: and now my first gold! thanks, newly-informed stranger! edit3: as well as platinum! one moment while i curl up in the corner and gibber quietly."

[CLS]	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	[SEP]	not blind but lived with a blind housemate for 7 years who was bi and kinky as fuck. we're still friends and hang out. most blind people have some degree of sight, she can see screens close up with magnifying software and enjoys watching what she can make out in burlesque videos. we been to a couple of burlesque shows together, she couldnt see shit but she did enjoy dressing up in corsets and stockings for them. she occasionally goes to a fetish night (which is incidently ran by a partially sighted woman! no, it's not a fetish night for blind people, just a coincidence) and my partner has made her costumes for them in the past. i'm guessing the costumes are appealing to her because of the sensation of the fabric or corsetting. she also told me she enjoyed electro sex and flogging when she's doing kink play, as a range of sensations are important to her. we're both sex positive and talk open about sex quite a bit actually. she gets up to some savage stuff, but none of it seems to have much to do with being blind just being a kinky mofo. honestly her kinkiness aside, from what shes told me, her sex life seems pretty much the same as any other bisexual persons i've heard, which is unsurprising as most people have vanilla sex in the dark anyway. i've noticed she is more in tune with sensual rather than visual stuff, like she talks about men and womens builds a lot, prefering lithe people with slender delicate limbs and hands. i guess touch or imagining being touched is more exciting when you can't see where it's coming from so a penchant for delicate hands makes sense. she's a lot of fun and a very happy, positive person. i deeply admire she never lets her blindness prevent her from enjoying things to the max. i've certainly never heard her complain about her blindness. edit: thankyou for the gold!

[CLS]	blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	[SEP]	i've (m) been totally blind for most of my life (24 now) and i'll try to answer this question. &#x200b; a couple of crossposts from /r/askblindpeople. &#x200b; the sound of their voice particularly when they are enthusiastic or laughing about something, the smell of their perfume/cologne/shampoo, the curves and musculature of their body when your close to them such as when hugging or brushing up against them by accident, basically all of the other non visual cues you already know but almost magnified. it's not super easy, but it does help you become less shallow i suppose. being attracted to personality over looks. though i've met many people with nice voices who i was later told were unattractive so that's not really a good indicator. often, if a woman is wearing heels or has a certain flirtyness or confidence about her, or if i've heard her talking about wearing sexier clothes i can assume she's probably at least decent looking. and what others say can of course be an indicator as well, but it's really never foolproof. i've never personally been close enough to someone romantically to feel comfortable asking to touch their face, and honestly even if i did, i don't know if i'd be able to get much out of it without having touched others to compare. yeah i know what poems and books consider attractive in a human face, but that's only a loose guideline, and doesn't really take into account things like laugh lines, facial expressions, and eye contact. i would probably ask someone i trusted and knew could communicate it properly, then try to get a second opinion. &#x200b; \-------------------------------------------------- &#x200b; as for porn and stuff, there are a few audio porn sites, but they aren't that popular among blind people because the narration usually isn't that great and it takes you out of it. most of us read erotica or listen to regular porn that just has good audio quality, no music, and close up/louder stuff going on. &#x200b; if anyone wants to know more about any fassit of blindness, please check out the faq post on /r/blind and then feel free to ask me anything you want more clarification on here as best as i can.

[CLS]	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	[SEP]	the best treatment for a child with anxiety is treating their parents anxiety. edit: thanks for the awards, kind strangers! for those curious, i am a licensed mental health professional that specializes in children. i appreciate that some people noted that anxiety is a necessary a healthy reaction that all people experience, very true! worries help keep us safe and let us know when there is danger. its the worries that interfere with daily functioning that become an issue. i think of anxiety issues on a spectrum, on one end is a healthy dose and on the other is a diagnosable anxiety disorder. there are people all across that spectrum that would benefit from therapy and/or learning some adaptive strategies. as some have pointed out, a childs anxiety is not 100% a result of a parents anxiety. there are, of course, cases where a child develops anxiety due to other circumstances. however, in the majority of cases with anxiety in children, it can be treated by treating the parent. children look to their parents for guidance to learn about what is and isnt safe. they are sponges that are constantly learning how to react to different things they approach. one of the easiest examples to see this is when a child experiences a minor injury/scare, they will naturally look to a trusted adult to judge how they should react. if the adult gasps, comes running with their arms extended, making a worried face, the child learns that was bad and they should be upset/hurt/scared. if the parent was to smile, shrug, and say oh man! the child will likely brush it off and move on (unless they acquired an injury, of course). think about this on a bigger scale, if a child is consistently learning the world is a scary and dangerous place, there are threats everywhere, etc. they are being set-up for anxiety issues. same goes for specific phobias, many of these are directly taught to children by seeing their parents fear. nothing says to be afraid of something more than the person you rely on for your survival showing their own genuine fear. simply following up with children regarding a scary or uncomfortable experience can make a world of difference! if you can inform them of what made that specific experience dangerous or scary, that helps teach them what to look out for instead of generalizing that fear to any experience that involves the same factors. one common example is childrens fear of bugs. the children have never had a bad experience with bugs, but the fact their parent runs away screaming from them each time she has an encounter, is a pretty clear message to them that they are not safe to be around. nothing like the person you trust most in this world expressing panic to discourage you from even getting close to them, especially when she tried reinforces your anxious reactions by holding you and crying with you after you nearly escape death by a caterpillar!

[CLS]	what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	[SEP]	copying a comment of mine from elsewhere: science and research have an incredibly high social prestige  especially on sites like reddit that are populated by young, liberal, college-educated people. acquiring scientific knowledge is still considered by many one of the noblest human endeavors. the scientist is revered as this idealistic being focused purely on uncovering the truth of nature. however, the academic research system is deeply broken. it is a ponzi scheme based on the exploitation of young people. the majority of labor in the academic research system is performed by phd students and postdocs, who are overworked and underpaid, and who have very little opportunity to advance their careers in research. as a consequence, manipulation and cheating are epidemic in the academic community. what is valued are not truthfulness and the sober assessment of data - the most important thing for a young scientists is publication impact. accordingly, those scientists who are able to blow their results out of proportion (without being caught) have a clear advantage in academic research. in science, the bullshitters often win. and you cant really blame the bullshitters and cheaters since a high impact paper can oftentimes mean the difference between a stable job and poverty. whenever you see a scientific study (especially one making revolutionary claims), you should assume that it's bullshit until it has been replicated.

[SEP]	"about the judicial system (from a court reporter): voice recognition is nowhere near being able to help with court reporting (unless one person is reciting everything into a microphone perfectly, which is a form of court reporting called voice writing, and even then it needs heavy editing). language in general, especially clearly written language, is an artform. also, juries don't have anywhere near the amount of evidence before them that the media may have on a particular case. tons of things are precluded because they're too prejudicial or for a slew of other reasons. i just did a bank robbery case where the guy had 11 prior bank robbery convictions, and the jury wasn't allowed to know that. so don't jump to conclusions about what might have been an ""obviously wrong"" verdict. prosecutors and judges are not on the same team. the judge has no control over how aggressively the prosecution tries their case or what kinds of sentencing they go for. public defenders do amazing work and are paid $100 an hour in my state, so it's not like a minimum wage job; and they get to choose which cases they accept, so it's not like there are just three guys who get all the cases dumped on them. and they can do private practice concurrently. a ton of sex offenders have severe developmental delays and don't understand that what they're doing is wrong. putting them in maximum security prison makes their behavior worse because it's like letting a five-year-old be raised by a bunch of violent adults. there should be gentler rehabilitation centers and more humane confinement for them, imho. ""civil commitment for an indefinite period"" like we have in my state is basically a life sentence in a hardcore correctional facility. dcf can take kids away from really loving parents if it took the parents too long to get their sh\*t together after addiciton. the contingencies they place on parents during recovery are draconian and lapses are forbidden, even though they're a known part of rehabilitation. imagine losing your child because you chose to order a beer with dinner."

[CLS]	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	[SEP]	okay, disclaimer, dont experience this please. but, a suicide attempt. its really hard to explain what goes on the second before it happens. right before i tried overdosing, i felt extremely relaxed and at peace. its completely surreal. like i said, do not experience one of these, it sucks being in a mental hospital.

[CLS]	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	[SEP]	"living alone for an *extremely* long time. i've been living alone since i left college - over *forty years ago*. people still comment how great it must be to ""have the house to yourself"". they have absolutely no idea - *no idea* - what's it's like to come home to an empty house and spend the evening alone, night after night. and then the nights stretch into months and years, and then finally decades spent alone. i retired a few years ago so now i'll often go for a few days without talking to anyone. some of the ramifications are just weird - for example my vocal chords have gotten weak from disuse so if i go to lunch with friends then the next day my throat is sore just from carrying on ordinary conversations. anyway this is why i love my dogs so much, at least i don't feel completely alone. people think they do, but they really have absolutely *no idea* what it's like."

[CLS]	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	[SEP]	before i became addicted to heroin i thought addicts we're just weak. no real man, no good person, no morally sound individual would throw their life away. it should be easy to stop once you take a step back and see what's happening. i had an alcoholic friend who i thought was insane for needing to go to aa. i didn't know what addiction was until i got hooked on heroin. i feel like there's no way to really get it until you're gripped by the power. i still don't think it's a disease but i also don't think that it's caused by stupidity or weakness. it's a scary thing. if i really liked chocolate cake but it made me sick as fuck between bites i'd never touch the stuff, but somehow i couldn't apply that logic to opiates.

[CLS]	whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	[SEP]	broccoli, more specifically after it has been properly cooked. for 25 years i hated the shit. went to culinary school. learned what butter and salt can do. now im like the mother fucking witness to the broccoli revival. also helps i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and now am kept alive by almost vegetables entirely. anyway. broccoli. love you.
