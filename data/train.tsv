parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	1. your emotions wont be this intense forever. but they are real and valid. my parents always invalidated my feelings  too dramatic, its just your hormones, youll grow out of it, you dont know how good you have it  while on some base level they possibly were right, it didnt mean my feelings werent real and intense in that moment. allow yourself to feel what you feel. but dont wallow or feed the depression kitty. it does get better. 2. if social media makes you feel shitty, just stop. it makes everyone feel shitty  even the people whose lives seem so much better and glamorous than yours. chances are, theyre posting that stuff to not feel shitty too. remember, everyone is posting their greatest hits. remember, everybody poops  even the girl posting glam pics from greece, she probably pooped right before or after the pic. point is, dont get wrapped up in that. take a month or two break from social media and see how you feel. 3. you dont have to go to college. and you also dont have to not go if you dont know what to do with your life. youll figure it out, maybe get inspired by your classes. and, as long as it will not launch you into a huge debt, it is ok to major in something you might not end up getting a career in. (to an extent). college is more than career training. its a much bigger learning experience about. everything! people, the world, yourself. dont dig a debt, work very hard, have lots of fun, and try to keep your eyes on a career path, but also absorb everything like a sponge. 4. i hated when people told me, you wont even miss high school when youre older. i did, for a little bit. and now, i really dont. as important as it is as a state of your pre-adulthood, in the big scheme of things, its just a tiny chapter. so dont get hung up on the mistakes you made or the drama you had. appreciate the experience for what it gave you, and move on. 5. lastly, and where i go all old lady, please put your phone away in the car. even at stoplights. just wait until you arrive. you may be super used to it, but it only takes one second of inattention to become potentially fatal. someone just died in my neighborhood for this very reason. sending a snap. it can wait. 6. (edit to add #6) teach yourself personal finance basics. your school and maybe parents probably neglected this, if times havent changed all that much. but. the internet is wonderful! you can teach yourself. take an edx or kahn or itunesu course. learn the basics and start saving. really truly understand student loans before taking them. and save. saving sounds like something you have plenty of time for later. when you make more money. but tomorrow never comes. learn and save now.	1484	41759	bqg2xi	eo4eeul

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	a lot of people try to glamorize high school and make you think your high school years are the best years of your life. for a lot of people, this just isn't true. it's okay not to like high school or to feel like you don't belong. you are not alone. it gets better. high schoolers deal with a lot of heavy shit. a lot of mental illness comes to light at this age, including depression and anxiety but also heavier stuff. many who struggle with these issues won't get help until years later. high school kids also deal with a lot of issues, like identity issues, bullying, pressure to conform, disputes with parents, the pressure associated with juggling work, school and life that often get better once high school is done. hang in there, it does get better.	10604	41759	bqg2xi	eo47gpr
parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	that we miss you & we actually want to spend time with you, not because of how you were (our little boy/girl) but because we are in awe of who you are and want to get to know you better, so you know we love you unconditionally but also that its ok and fun to hang out sometimes; soon youll be leaving home, time passes quickly, and we want to create as many good memories as we can for you so you can use them for when the world is not so kind and im not around to give you a hug. youre amazing, youve always been and i know your life will be filled with ups and downs but i hope the love we share reminds you that youll always have a soft spot to land edit: note: thank you so much for your comments, i wish i could hug you all. thank you to those who granted me awards, i never thought an open letter to my son would move so many.i actually showed this to him, we both cried, hugged and laughed but most importantly and thanks to all of you i just became way cooler! im sorry for those of you who did not have a great upbringing, i didnt either, thats why youll be, just like me, especially careful with your kids emotional well-being, because after all, its their story in the making. edit 2: wow. dear reddit community, i want to share something with you: my son and i have read each one of your comments, i cannot express how this has been a deeply moving experience and that your words mean a lot to us. if you didnt have love and support growing up, i hear you, i do; its up to you now to give it, itll free you from the constrains of being hurt by the lacking. you dont have to be a parent, sometimes we choose our family, and love knows no titles, i have learned that by constantly feeling that love above all, hard moments and little (or big) grudges have the space to be felt and transform themselves into growing opportunities so we can, of course, love ourselves and others. my son sits here with me and we have had so many conversations because of your words, all of you are important in my book, youve made a huge difference today to this random family, irl.	5920	41759	bqg2xi	eo49ny3

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	build good health habits now. if you're not already active, find a simple active hobby you can do. take up pokemon go or take up bike riding or something. also, learn how to cook some basic and healthy meals like chicken pesto pasta or fried rice. the healthier you are as a teen the easier it is to stay healthy as an adult. edit: my food options seem super controversial, like portion control and different recipes aren't a thing. but here's a recipe that's super simple, fairly healthy, takes about 5-10 minutes and anyone can do. buy some bagged lettuce, or like 2-3 different kinds of lettuce if you can get the fresh stuff. take a cucumber grab some olives or carrots or whatever else you like. snag some feta cheese. fry up a small amount of minced turkey (i get that everyone hates fried food, but again, proportions are key). put lettuce in bowl, slice up as much cucumber as you want, add that to bowl, cut up carrots, add to bowl, same with olives and extra veggies. put in the small amount of turkey (like 100g is enough) and crumble a small amount of feta on top (feta has a strong flavor so you always need less than you think you do). it makes a really delicious salad that fills you up for hours. turkey is also naturally flavorful when fried like that so you can add spices or not and it's still fine.	8859	41759	bqg2xi	eo48b59

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	**it's okay to not have a plan yet.** *edit, to clarify, i think you should have at least loose goals, something (anything) you're working toward, otherwise you'll go nowhere. but the plan to get there doesn't have to be well thought out yet, you definitely don't have to have to know all the details at this point, and you certainly shouldn't beat yourself up or stress out. **edit: thanks to /u/drgrabass for making me make this at least moderately more useful advice.	1250	41759	bqg2xi	eo464e4
parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	right now you have options, figure out what you want, every bill you get, every responsibility you add to you life takes away options. eventually people have all these bills and kids and marriages or whatever, but its all responsibilitys that you are going to have. it might take a few years to figure out , no big deal. just dont go buy that new car because you want to be cool, you just took away a little bit of freedom. live free now, you have very few responsibilities. do all the crazy dumb shit, fail at business. we need more entrepreneurs, do it and fail now. because when your 30 with a family and career and you didnt take that chance when you were a teen (early 20s) it will dig at you every day.	600	41759	bqg2xi	eo46raa
parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	"when i was teenager i was going through a really rough patch where i felt i might have depression. i didn't know who to talk to, so i thought i'd ask my doctor about it. i told him i thought i might be depressed and asked if he had any suggestions on what to do. he laughed at me and said, ""you're not depressed, you're just a teenager."" i never went back to that doctor again, but i also didn't open up to anyone about the way i felt again. i went though a really self-destructive peoriod following that using drugs, alcohol, and self-harm to cope and about to flunk out my school, which was one of the best private schools in the city. i was at a real low point and one night when i was set on killing myself, my dog snoopy convinced me not to and made me want to try and get better. i finally decided to try and get some help again and after i did i wished i had done it sooner. my point is don't be afraid to ask others for help. wanting to better your mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, even if it might feel that way."	1869	41759	bqg2xi	eo46gst

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	gain more life experience before considering children.(or even chancing it for that matter.) having a child when you're too young or inexperienced robs the baby of much needed stability and direction. an education, halfway decent job and a general understanding of life is highly recommend. source: became a father at a young age, no formal education, had a 17k/year job(at the time) and was in an otherwise unhappy relationship with the mother. note: she wasn't planned nor is she regretted, she forced me to grow tf up, step out of my comfort zone and land an actual job that can pay the bills.	419	41759	bqg2xi	eo49rwn

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	as a mom, and a former teen, sometimes life just sucks, and it feels like it will never get better, but often times the suckiness is temporary. it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but maybe there is a bend in the path that is keeping the light from you. keep going till you get some agency and can make your own decisions and choices for what your life looks like. when i was 14 i really wanted to die. i was bullied and i felt unimportant in my family. i was ready to commit suicide, but i somehow talked myself into waiting until i was an adult. thank goodness i waited, life has been 1000% better and different from how i expected. i still occasionally get twinges of depression, but i get through in increments of 15 minutes at a time. you have value. you are worthy. you are loved.	425	41759	bqg2xi	eo4a2ey

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	disclaimer: not a parent. * don't smoke cigarettes. holy shit, i started at 15 and couldn't come to a full stop until i was 24. it might take some stress off or seem like a really easy way to socialize with people, but it's just a crutch. * use moderation in everything; don't get mixed up in addictive substances. there is absolutely such a thing as a psychological addition to substances that aren't physically addictive. just because weed won't kill you and doesn't create physical addiction, doesn't mean you can't become psychologically addicted to it. what do you think is the hardest part about quitting cigarettes? from my experience, most addicts will tell you that it's the routine. same thing applies to pot. if you're going to smoke pot, use moderation. is what you're considering taking physically addictive? pull your shit together and don't get involved in it. * fuck who you want (you know, with mutual consent and all), but use condoms. use condoms. use condoms you daft shit. * she/you is/are on birth control? congrats, use a condom. 100% of post-nut clarity will tell you that you're not at a time in your life to even risk having kids. * he/she's totally clean? definitely use a condom. guess what? they tell everyone they're clean, which means they're not using condoms with other people and probably have no fucking idea whether they're actually clean. the only exception to this should be long-term relationships after extremely careful consideration by both you and your partner. still, ymmv. be warned. * also, condoms don't fully protect against herpes. * actually pay attention in class. i spent so much time dicking around and looking for ways to burn time before the bell; i missed out on so much as a result. i'll never give a fuck about the memes i was browsing in my dc calculus class, but i definitely gave a fuck when i was in college level calculus classes and didn't remember the subject foundations that i should have established earlier on. additionally, paying attention is just a good habit. you might not give a fuck about the subject, but high school is most important in teaching you *how* to learn complex(ish) topics. it's a skill that you'll need no matter where you go in life. * don't make life decisions based on your high school paramore. for fucks sake, neither of your brains have fully developed. neither of you have any idea how the other will turn out in two, five, or ten years. i went from being some burnout stoner in the bottom third of my high school class to a law student who graduated with honors and an academic publication. some of the smartest people i knew fell off the deep end and never left their parents' houses, despite having every opportunity in the world to do so. * learn how to cut out the toxic people in your life. it might take time and patience, and a little finesse, but it's a thing i wish i'd learned to do before my early-mid twenties. you'll be a hundred times happier for it. * if you go to college, major in something marketable. minor in whatever the fuck you enjoy. don't flush 100k down the drain for an art history degree. * on that note, if you're planning on going to college, start applying for scholarships early. even if you're extremely fortunate and your family is covering your tuition, start applying for scholarships. student loans may seem like some distant problem, but you'll curse the ever loving fuck out of your past (current) self if you don't start taking some steps to mitigate needing loans. * if your family is covering your tuition through a 529 plan, whatever is leftover goes to you at the end of college. build a huge cushion with scholarships and be ahead of the curve in savings when you graduate. * finally, you're about to learn that time flies. you think you know now? it gets worse. it feels like last month that i left home to start college. that was seven years ago. enjoy every day. enjoy living with your parents and having stupid rules to follow. enjoy riding your crappy bike and working at that crappy pizza joint. enjoy that boring day with your friends where you're all sitting around with no idea what to do. one day, that's all going to go away. it's all going to be a memory as you shuffle through the increasingly complex and challenging world of adulthood. make no mistake, it's still exciting and you'll have more memories to make, but the ones you make today? make them fond.	67	41759	bqg2xi	eo4qc4t
parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	we love you and are so proud of you. we watch you when you think we're not looking and are in awe of every inch of you. you used to fit so perfectly in our arms, and we knew how to keep you safe. we put you down for only a second, and when we picked you up again, you had learned to crawl. we put you down once more, and in the blink of an eye, you had learned how to walk. there was now an urgency and rush in your exploration of the world. you wanted to absorb everything, and we reluctantly had to start letting you go. your first act of defiance was growing without permission, and before we were ready. the only new role we had to adjust to was becoming parents; we tried to figure it out as we went along. mistakes were made. many. and sometimes, more than once. it's not an excuse, just a fact. but it was harder for you, because you had so many roles you were expected to step into: son/daughter, brother/sister, grandchild, student, extracurricular sports. the entire list must be overwhelming. what we should tell you is that even in failure, you will never do wrong. we fell for you. we fell hard. we adore and worship every strand of hair on you, regardless what colour of hair you're experimenting with; every millimeter of skin; every heartbeat. subconsciously, and silently, we do want you to strive for perfection, because that's what the world is going to expect from you. narcissistically, we believe that your failures and succeses will be a reflection of our parenting. we ride you hard sometimes, because that seems to be what we're supposed to do. but the truth is that we're partly scared. we know we will have to leave you some day. we hate the thought of you being alone in this world, because we know, have seen and experienced some of the terrible parts of life and others. we haven't really done that great of a job in running the world, and the legacy you'll inherit will be terrifying some times. all we can do is try to prepare you to be able to supercede us and our accomplishments. we want you to do, and be better than us. we need you to do and be better than us. we know it's a huge burden. forgive us. we love you, and are so proud of you xx	43	41759	bqg2xi	eo4lz7p

"learn the art of conversation. before you are an adult embarrassing yourself in front of smart, considerate adults conversation skills include: 1. stop with the constant ""facts"". unless what you are quoting is a paper with cited sources and you are talking with other experts in said field. otherwise you come off as a fake know it all who knows nothing but what they read on the internet. people see through that shit and it's annoying to say the least. 2. it is not a conversation if you are not asking questions. it's just you talking and holding another hostage. also, they aren't listening 3. take time to think about what is being said by someone other than you. waiting for your turn to talk is also not a conversation 4. interrupting. it's okay to be excited and some people's conversation is more interrupty than other's, but be mindful 5. know your audience. conversation can quickly turn into arguing. so if it's conversation you're going for, read the crowd and avoid escalation to sum it up don't be a dick"	38	41759	bqg2xi	eo4qrey

parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	you guys are awesome. ive been in education for 24 years and overall, teenagers today are so much more accepting, affirming, and supportive than theyve ever been. im so proud of how you guys stick up for kids with disabilities, kids who are different, or just the underdog. your generation gets so much undeserved crap, but you just keep on being great.	46	41759	bqg2xi	eo4ff7l
parents of reddit, what's something that you think teenagers of reddit need to hear?	don't be afraid to approach and talk to someone you find attractive. they're most likely just as shy as you. it's also a numbers game. the more you put yourself out there, the more you'll get comfortable and great at starting small talk (which is also helpful later during job interviews) leading to more dates. or hook-ups ;) one last thing, fake confidence works. you may be dying on the inside but keep your poker face and no one will ever know!!	49	41759	bqg2xi	eo4gx78
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	as someone who struggles with ptsd, i would like to say that i don't choose to be as repetitive and exhausting as i can be. i will react the same way to the same situation because that is an association that has been with me for half my life. it's very difficult to keep opening up to friends without feeling like a burden because you cannot cope with the same thing as last week. they have heard me talk about it so often and given me several pieces of advice on it and i hate feeling like this broken record, but to me that is a core part of this disorder. edit: obligatory thanks for the first reddit gold! also, thank you so much for your responses. i've been reading all of them during breaks and try to respond here and there.	7538	47462	brzuwa	eohvxz4

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	something to help with the stigma? most people don't see mental illness until it has manifested itself outwardly. you know, the homeless guy yelling at a trash can type of thing. realize that you are looking at the extreme end, thinking that is what mental illness is, is like thinking someone with 90% of their skin scorched off is what a burn looks like.	34601	47462	brzuwa	eohv74z
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	physical therapy is seen as a regular part of recovery from of any serious injury. theres no stigma attached for someone in a cast or a wheelchair to see a physical therapist. mental health counseling should be considered in the same light.	611	47462	brzuwa	eohvp69
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	as someone with bipolar, i always compare it to diabetes. it's a lifelong condition, usually managed by medication though occasionally people manage without. the medication isn't always perfect, so you have to let those around you know the warning signs. if you ignore / stop taking your meds suddenly, you will have serious problems and may embarrass yourself in public. sadly, i've recently had to add an extra section to my explanation as part of an apology. if you're a diabetic in hospital waiting for your foot to be amputated, even if you took your meds perfectly, you get limited sympathy if you spent every weekend stuffing yourself with cake. for bipolar, the equivalent tends to be booze / drugs, and god damn is the level of substance abuse high amongst us.	9932	47462	brzuwa	eohvbiv

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	it hurts to know that you can't trust anyone. you nevet know when someone is going to sell your secrets and tell everyone about that one thing you did when you were extremely ill just for some karma. you hear stories of crazy people doing weird things and know that some day you might be the crazy person people talk about for morbidness. and to get better you always need to trust nurses and doctors, and yourself. and that's hard to do when you're seen as an anecdote and not as a person.	1186	47462	brzuwa	eohuxoq

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	intrusive thoughts are exactly that. intrusive. the amount of times people have told me to just shrug it off or not think about it is annoying. edit: i've been asked for an example so i'll share my personal experience. what a lot of people seem to misunderstand is that most of the time they aren't traditional thoughts. they are commands your brain tries to issue and you have to mentally block them and stop them from occuring. having to constantly stop yourself from hacking someone with a cleaver or shoving a glass in someone's face really messes with your day. sometimes you just can't function properly and it really messes with your head to constantly deal with that kind of stress on top of living a normal life. edit 2: for people asking how i cope. first of all knowledge about the condition is the best thing you can acquire to combat it. once you know why things are happening you can deal with them. on top of that i have a meditative coping strategy for when it gets paticularly bad in inconvenient situations. i know it sounds silly but i'll take 10 seconds or so, imagine a wall with an iron bolted door in my head and forcefully lock that 'version' of myself in there. then i'll squash it, like the trash compactor from star wars . coupled with this i have a great doctor and some medication which really helps keep it under control. the final thing is more of a lifestyle change. i keep a strict exercise schedule and weekday routine which is more important to me than a lot of things in my life. it reminds me that i'm in control and my discipline won't falter. hope this helps someone!	10206	47462	brzuwa	eohv1ma
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you're dealing with people who are essentially running with one leg in a two legged race. the bar for success for the mentally ill is much different than everyone else. for instance, someone suffering from severe depression making it to old age is sometimes a great feat. it certainly kills many before they get there. edit: to all of you who have replied and i cannot answer, cheers to you for getting up and doing what you need to do to get through another day. i know it's hard. i know it's thankless. i know it seems pointless, but you've achieved more than you think and can keep achieving more. congratulations on what you've accomplished so far!	6479	47462	brzuwa	eohuqrn
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	just because someone looks okay doesn't mean they are okay. i have a full time job. i have a house. i have a decent wage and i'm doing okay for my age. i also have borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, possibly ptsd, and traits of other personality disorders. i appear to function on the outside, but inside i struggle every day. i co-own my house with my dad, and despite living with me even he thinks i'm okay. people who are suffering often bottle it up in an attempt to not be a burden or to just try and get on with life, but it wears them down. reach out to your friends and ask how they are. let them know you're there for them. and if they disclose they have a certain disorder, do a little research think about how it affects them rather than how it affects you. you can't make them talk to you but you can show them you're there.	1107	47462	brzuwa	eohx66o

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i cant answer the phone. cant drive the car sometimes, even for groceries or prescriptions. cant go to sleep. cant deal with criticism. its like entropy, a small thing grows all on its own into an unrelated mess of disorganized anger and frustration often over nothing tangibly real. but its so real to me. it becomes panic. or anger at myself. to combat this i feel the need to be perfect, constantly. you could consider this a benefit, i often out perform my peers. but if i fail, even a little, im a failure to myself. i lost a hat in january and im still punishing myself for it. so to you, on the outside, i do everything right and that makes you think im okay, annoying even. i make good enough money and im successful in my field. but the moment im alone i pull the skin off my scalp with my fingernails and have almost no close relationships. i cant control how i feel. i know its not normal, but i know i do everything i can to try to cope. i probably didnt answer the question but thats the adhd.	117	47462	brzuwa	eohza0d

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"talk about it. suicide is the second most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, so they are a big clientele to reach. but also middle-aged people are at high risk, especially men. you can share articles that talk positively about mental illness and recovery, along with being active in foundations for suicide prevention like the [afsp in the us](https://afsp.org/take-action/), the [nspa in uk](https://www.nspa.org.uk/) or whichever it is in your country. most importantly, if you know someone who is feeling down or has suicidal thoughts, the best thing you can do to help is listen and ask directly ""do you have suicidal thoughts?"". this leaves them with a simple yes or no question, so they aren't the one who have to ""say it out loud"". don't panic when someone says ""yes""! you can have suicidal thoughts without wanting to actively take your life,; they are a coping mechanism for underlying issues. if you think you can handle it, ask how persistent they are, if they can distance themselves from those thoughts or if they have a plan on how to take their life. make sure to use the word ""suicide"" or any phrases without a negative connotation (see: ""killing yourself""). **don't** give advice: just actively listen and comfort them in a way that doesn't make them feel trivialized or judged. staying away from any moral judgements (regarding their feelings) is very important! also, you can offer to support them when they plan to get treatment, like accompanying them when going to the doctor, figuring out who to call and so on. there are also some chat or mail-based counceling options if speaking in person or on the phone is too much for them. edit: clarified some points, different wording"	782	47462	brzuwa	eohut24

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would say the prevalence of antagonist characters that have a (usually misrepresented or grossly inaccurate) mental health issue is a problem. same for a lot of true crime documentaries and the like, where they speculate on whether the perpetrator might have had some kind of mental illness without explaining the illness correctly, or write off a person's actions as being down to the effects of the mental illness. i can tell if someone has been influenced by this kind of shitty pop culture by the way they look at me and others. no, being bipolar does not mean i might murder you for no logical reason. in fact, it makes me statistically more likely to be murdered or a victim of abuse.	364	47462	brzuwa	eohvrf2

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i would like to say how wonderful my patients have been. most people are just looking for help and support on their way to recovery, like you would do with any physical illness. i mainly work with schizophrenia patients, and i am lucky to have met a whole variety of people from different backgrounds, with different interests and hobbies, who go about their lives like everyone else, just with a few more difficulties along the way! stigma is still real, despite the 'awareness' campaigns. i suppose it's best to remember that people with every type of mental health 'disorder' live by your side, they may be your neighbour, your teacher, your employee, your friend. don't isolate these people from society, help them by creating opportunities for them to join in! if you are in the uk at the moment there has been a good series of mental health documentaries that you can watch on iplayer. including 'psychosis and me', 'anxiety and me', and 'depression and me'. as well as the latest from louis theroux, i highly recommend you check them out.	91	47462	brzuwa	eohv8hk
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	we literally have no control over what our mind is doing, feeling, or how its going to react to anything. there is zero control. be understanding that this is much harder for the sufferer than it is for you. your brain is an organ and like any other organ it can get sick or weakened or simply not work as strongly or efficiently as it used to. you wouldnt expect someone to just get over or snap out of a heart attack or kidney failure. its unfair to expect the same of mental illness. edit because this got a lot more popular than i ever expected. while most people are agreeing with me, some seem to think im being damaging in what i say so ill make it clear. what goes on in our mind we cannot control. the thoughts, compulsions, panics that just appear we cannot preempt or stop. we *all* can, however, work hard to recover. we can seek help, get medicine, use coping mechanisms that will help us control how we act and react. but nobody can ever convince me we can just stop thinking the things that pop into our brains.	4488	47462	brzuwa	eohu0mm

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	people are coping the best way they can based on their experience. for example, someone who yells and turns people away can just be trying to comfort themselves based on past experience of letting someone in and being hurt by it. treatment is about learning new coping skills that will give people comfort that also gives them other things they need in their life (relationships, stability, etc.)	121	47462	brzuwa	eohuuf5
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i know this isn't exactly what your asking for, but as someone who works in mental health, has suffered from mental health issues and has witnessed some of the effects. get. off. social. media. reddit isn't too bad because it isn't tied to your personality and identity. but get off instagram, facebook, snapchat and any other media that is linked to your real identity and self worth. those platforms are directly responsible for more harm to young people's mental health than everything else combined. i know of multiple suicides, attempted suicides and self harm cases that are a result of interaction on social media. i work in the nhs and we can't keep up with all the depressed teenagers that come in with depression and anxiety brought on by social media use. this in turn is stopping us from treating serious cases of mental illness. every single young person who has deleted their social media accounts on professional advice (in my service) has immediately felt a significant improvement in their mental health, their self worth and a reduction in their anxiety. please, if you do nothing else this year. delete your social media apps, wait for the withdrawal to wear off and feel the freedom that comes with not feeling like your whole life is on show and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone. edit 1: under no circumstances should you feel like you are taking up a professionals time. i know i said we're overloaded, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help. definitely seek help if you feel like you aren't coping. edit 2: if you have a healthy relationship with social media then that's great, but if logging into instagram has you feeling fat, worthless, boring, ugly, poor, stupid, or any other negative feeling. delete it. cheers for the silver. well shit. gold too. thanks a bunch.	433	47462	brzuwa	eohw6pw

"i am bipolar. people don't know how to react when you tell them you're ill. which i understand of course. we talk a lot about people that are mean or treat you like you're crazy and stuff. it sucks obviously but we talk so much about them that we forget about the other side of the coin. when people are too benevolent or sympathetic, they can also cause damages. i am surrounded by friends and by my family and they all support me which is great and i'm very greatful for that. but sometimes (or always) they have absolutely no idea what to say but feel like they must say something no matter what. they usually try to reassure you but doing this they just get the opposite reaction. i call it minimization. basically, they tell you not to worry, what you're experiencing isn't that bad don't be afraid, they also feel like this sometimes it's gonna be fine stop. doing. this. it's the worst. imagine you feel like shit or that something's reaaally wrong and you're afraid, and then someone tells you ""meh it's okay everybody have ups and downs ;)"". all my friends and my family (except my sister) do that. now everytime i fell like something's happening, i'm asking myself ""do i really need to see my doctor? is there really something wrong? am i faking it?"". so yeah, not useful at all, i'd rather be told to worry so i can get some help instead of keeping it to myself. also it's painful and really annoying so now i just don't talk to anybody at all, except my sister. what does she do ? what do i personally want people to do ? just listen to my rants or worries or news from my doctors, but don't say anything. accept that you will never understand it so don't try to give advice, judge (yeah some friends told my i take too much meds and that they worry), relate, reassure, etc. i just need a shoulder to cry on and that's it. the only people that i will listen to are my doctors, and that's it. it's my personnal situation so maybe other will disagree with me."	259	47462	brzuwa	eohv6p2

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i think my concussions have fucked me up permanently. i grew up playing hockey every day for 15 years, trying to make the nhl. but after being knocked unconscious for the 10th time something. changed. my long term memory is non existent, im very irritable and depressed. i cant look people in the eyes anymore. i went from social butterfly to a compete hermit shut in that cant bare being in public. are these things correlated? my parents refuse to believe they are and they think im being dramatic. im not. i think about suicide on a daily basis. i was *never* like this until my last violent head trauma. ive probably had over 25 instances of severe head trauma (*at least*), i only know for sure of the ones where i was knocked out cold.	37	47462	brzuwa	eohwqzm

"as someone who suffers from schizophrenia, one thing that i hear the most is """"shouldn't you be locked up?"" . seriously people? i thought society has moved past the point where psychopaths in horror movies represent what a disorder is actually like. no, i will not murder your child. no, i will not commit any other crime you might be thinking of right now. relax, we aren't as dangerous as you think. in fact, we aren't that dangerous at all ( most of the time. ) why not give me a goddamn chance?"	37	47462	brzuwa	eohwtu1
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you wish to understand someone with a mental health condition please educate yourself and research the condition. i have a lot of people who claim to know and try to give advice. once you've worked with professionals the average persons advice can become awkward and patronising at times. learn before you weigh in. it's a very sensitive subject and would go some way to lessening the stigma if more people educated themselves.	67	47462	brzuwa	eohvgef
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	dont stray away from a person if they confessed their struggles to you. theyre probably in a very difficult situation and trust you enough to tell you about it. you should get informed about their mental illness and try to fix it with them. or just be supportive at least or get someone who can help more than you involved but i just beg you dont under any circumstances stray away from them	129	47462	brzuwa	eohvm2j

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	anorexia is not a disorder of vanity. i have this disease and am also doing my phd on perceptions of eating disorders. eating disorders are so incredibly complex, yes they are a disorder of control, but it goes deeper. as a start, if i could change one thing tomorrow or would be the normalisation of commenting on peoples weight. also, you cant simply assume the severity of this condition by a persons weight. eds come in many forms, a lot of sufferers dont look like the media-depicted version of anorexia. be gentle on us and put down your assumptions.	55	47462	brzuwa	eoi1fug

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	i was diagnosed with bipolar-ii disorder and depression about two years ago, which to me, was a relief. until that point, people close to me would sometimes point out that i seemed to be out of it. i'd be extremely emotional, unable to focus, and paranoid (to a lesser degree than the other two, but still). over time, i had become desensitized to these things and they became my new normal. after starting medication, then forgetting to take it, followed by a short involuntary commitment to the local hospital, and then constant and proper use of my medication, it hit me. before seeking treatment, i just didn't know anything was wrong. my point is we often don't know something is going on until others point the signs out to us. i sure as hell didn't. nowadays, i'm doing much better! the depression is under control and the bipolar-ii stuff is mostly controlled. i do have manic episodes once in a while, but it's usually just me starting to write about stuff and becoming bored. the depressive episodes don't happen anymore. yay! i'm starting my senior year at the local university in august, so everything is looking good from here. maybe i'll meet someone and end up with a girlfriend. who knows? so yeah, look out for the people you are close to. you might be the first one to pick up on something.	29	47462	brzuwa	eohw4hv
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	those struggling are often experts at hiding it. just like how it's extremely hard to spot someone drowning in a crowded pool, it's almost impossible to know who of your friends, family and peers is struggling with their mental health if they don't tell you. i can guarantee you that you personally know at least one person struggling with their mental health. if you don't know who it is, they are trying so hard to hide their issues because they are scared of how you (or others) will react. you might have spoken to them about their very issues (maybe even in a negative way) and never knew you were directly addressing them. mental health isn't padded rooms and strait jackets, it's real people with real issues. there should be no stigma or shame for being a human being.	28	47462	brzuwa	eohy2ap
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	if you met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism. it's a spectrum for a reason. not everyone's super smart with a lovable tick like media loves to portray us, some of us feel like shit because we're expected to be prodigies by even our own families, but some of us can't even do simple tasks without going through a ton of mental stress and burning out.	27	47462	brzuwa	eohy5s5
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	behavioural health tech of 3 years. ive had every type of person come through my facility. from your preschool teachers to executives of fortune 500 to clergymen to college students. no one is immune from stress and mental health. dont let the fact that youre getting straight as make you feel like your not the ones that need a counsellor. or that because people usually vent to you that you dont need to vent either. bad stress is bad stress. and sometimes, even for the ones that seem to have it all, can make a person crack. get help before you crack. because once you do, its much harder to come back from then having too much stress.	29	47462	brzuwa	eohya5a
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	people need to stop treating moments of sadness as mental problem or depression.	148	47462	brzuwa	eohv2n7
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	nobody can continuously move upwards. if you go back a few steps, that doesn't mean you didn't go up those steps in the first place. you've done it before and you can do it again. stagnating or even regressing is perfectly normal, entirely human and expecting otherwise is irrational. the sooner you realize that the sooner you'll be able to put the breaks on how hard you're crashing and start working on going back up those steps and further.	23	47462	brzuwa	eohxjg7
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you would go to the doctor to treat a broken leg or diabetes or pneumonia. mental health treatment is just as valid.	23	47462	brzuwa	eohw1ei
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	im not lazy. telling me im lazy makes me feel even less motivated and hate myself even more, thus making me want to lay in bed all day wallowing in my own self hatred. i want to be good at things and excel, i just cant especially when im being told im lazy. i want to shrivel up and die most of the time, you shitting on me makes me want to hide in my cocoon thus making me stay in this rut. im proud of you for doing x has literally made me cry. even just taking care of myself and having someone say you look really good, im proud of you for coming out means *a lot*. positive reinforcement means everything when you have severe depression.	118	47462	brzuwa	eohvnaz
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop handing out borderline personality disorder as an armchair diagnosis. the only way you can diagnose anyone is if you're a licensed professional seeing a client, face to face. other than that, no you can not diagnose anyone with anything, because you have no training and are not a professional. it gets under my skin the amount of times i've seen a bpd diagnosis get thrown around by people who have no idea what bpd actually is. the only thing that throwing around a diagnosis does, is further stigmatize people like myself who actually suffer from bpd. which sucks because it's already an extremely stigmatized disorder.	21	47462	brzuwa	eohywkf
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	stop villainizing meds. i have bipolar disorder and its so hard to hear people bash medications and suggest meditation or natural remedies or other such bullshit. the medications keep me alive. without them i would have killed myself or gotten locked up decades ago.	20	47462	brzuwa	eoi8yfn
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	with bipolar there are times that i need to be completely left alone to allow me to stay in my mindset, and their times where i need people to intercede and grab my hands or head to kick me out of whatever mindset that i have been locked into. unfortunately i may not show any outer signs which i'm in and both ways i have very little control. hopefully (like i have done) a bipolar person will train themselves to have a trigger which it allows you to ask the question of which problem they're having. for me if you hand me a coke or any liquid it pulls me out of my mind long enough that you can determine or you couldn't ask which part of the bipolar i mean positive or negative.	39	47462	brzuwa	eohv7rl
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	telling me to chill out, relax or not worry doesn't help. instead it creates more anxiety. some days little things set me off, some days when everything goes wrong i do not panic or cry till the end. i can not turn the worry off. anxiety has crippled me for years. if i say i don't want to go out or can't handle the store, please realize i cant and the smallest tasks to me seem like conquering mount everest. also stop recommending diets, yoga or meditation. if it was that easy i would, sometime medication is the only thing that helps.	39	47462	brzuwa	eohvvfx

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	self injury and scars: i spent 10 years of my life selfharming. more stitches then i can count. my arm is completely scarred and ruinied. how does that make me feel? honestly. it took me alot to get here, but i am not ashamed. i am proud that i can wear my stripes with my head high. cause for years i hid my arm under long sleeves and a black long gloves (i cut the glove-fingers off.) i got so many questions. remarks. and one day i just felt done. of hiding. i took the glove off, trying it out. and its the most liberating thing ive ever done. yes people look, but surprisingly not as much as you would think. it is pretty clear to everyone what i have done. people commented more when i tried to hide it. so i wear my scars proudly. ive been told by others who has selfharmed that they feel inspired to do the same. cause in all honesty people, as cliche as it sounds, they are your battlescars. the proof you despite all this pain, made it through . if people ask, be honest. if people stare, smile back. let them stare. its not dangerous. think of the road it took you to get here. and here you are. putting that chapter behind you. showing everyone that you fucking made it ! now how is that something to be ashamed of?	94	47462	brzuwa	eohwmco

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"i was in class yesterday,social psychology class giving a presentation on discourses. i made my presentation about how i suffer with bpd and what life is like with it,how it affects me and what people think of me. i made a slide with traits and characteristics of me as an individual versus the traits i display when my borderline personality disorder acts up. at the end of the presentation,she made me go back to the slide and asked who else in the room experiences intense anger,unstable interpersonal relationships,feelings of emptiness,etc. and that not one person can say they've never experienced at least one of the plethora of symptoms. many ""normal"" or ""regular"" people experience those symptoms,albeit not 5-9 all together but they experience some,and they are not labeled as freaks. so what makes people without mental illness be able to judge someone else with a mental illness when they experience similar symptoms."	15	47462	brzuwa	eohybuq

"just because your having trouble focusing today doesn't mean you have adhd. i'm tired of the ""lol. i'm so adhd! squirrel!"" shtick. if you truly had this disorder, you'd have trouble the majority of days and it would affect your life. forgot your keys? forgot to turn in a paper? forgot your lunch on the counter? it was probably a mistake. it happens to everyone once in awhile. shake it off and set reminders. consistently forget your keys, to turn in a paper, or forget your lunch consistently? did you keep trying strategies to help, but you still consistently screw up like this? sounds like a disorder. you probably have adhd and should talk to someone. without long term strategies and/or medication, you'll be like a car stuck in the mud that's spinning its tires as fast as it can but doesn't go anywhere."	15	47462	brzuwa	eoiasg9

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	don't be afraid of us. show care and kindness to an ill person instead of trepidation and they will 100% appreciate it. take the time to make your own opinion of somebody before automatically accepting the harsh assumptions and stereotypes that are associated with a particular mental illness.	14	47462	brzuwa	eohvjog

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	please don't say you have depression just because you feel sad once in a while. it's a real mental illness and not something teenagers should normalize to make themselves feel part of a smaller group of people. same goes for ocd. you don't have ocd if you want to arrange shit, ocd is far more serious than that.	90	47462	brzuwa	eohvulz
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	mental illness is a sickness, just like how there are other forms of sicknesses, mental health is a sickness of the brain. we can't control what are mental illnesses do or don't do. we just do the best we can and hope for the best. and i will say this again, we cannot control our mental illnesses. that would be like telling someone to control the flu they have or the chicken pox(not the best examples, but the best i got got at 2 in the morning). trust us, if we could control it, we would. and for others who suffer from mental illness, you shouldn't be ashamed about it. it takes a lot of courage and willpower to have to go through the constant stuggle and still maintain a life. as someone who has mental illness(anxiety, ocd, and depression), i just want to say, we can't control it, and it is imaginary or make belief or something we are faking. it's real, it's real illnesses, and we cant just make it go away. and for any people with mental illness that has read my comment, and people just in general, i'll say exactly what i got tattooed on my arm: your story isn't over yet; i hope this will help others gain some insight into mental illness. i have examples for some, but right now i am too tired to type them out so if someone wants to hear them, let me know. and to everyone suffering, i want to say, keep fighting. better days will come your way, i know it :)	14	47462	brzuwa	eohviv7

as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	"it's no secret that some mental illnesses have been trivialised and even romanticised, but it's important to remember that there are what i call ""ugly"" sides of some mental illnesses. for example, and i'm a bit embarrassed to say this but, i have severe depression and it gives me a lack of motivation. this lack of motivation makes it very hard for me to be hygienic (i usually manage to pull through and be presentable when i need to be). i just wish i didn't have to feel embarrassed talking about this stuff. depression isn't just 'feeling sad'. it has a lot more baggage, and so do other mental illnesses."	13	47462	brzuwa	eohwmsi
as a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?	you can have ptsd without ever having gone to war. my therapist is a combat veteran and im a sexual abuse survivor. we both have ptsd. were reading a book about trauma together. this book really destroyed the myth that civilians cant have ptsd and i wish i could just show it to every single person i meet. no matter *what* happened, the symptoms are almost the exact fucking same, just different triggers.	24	47462	brzuwa	eohxahn

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	ectopic pregnancy ovaries are ovulatin and doing their things. eggs and what not. an egg decides enough is enough, and with the help of a hormone surge, wants out of that shit. bigger and better things. so the egg literally punches out, and is supposed to go straight into the fallopian tubes, get fertilized while inside the tubes, and then plant in the uterus. you would think that the entrance of the fallopian tubes would connect right to the ovary? nah the opening of the fallopian tube has these little hairs (fimbriae) that are like wacky inflatable tube men in front of sketchy used car lots, and kind of guide the egg into the fallopian tube. sometimes, the eggs dont feel like it going, and they venture off. and if fertilized, its considered an ectopic pregnancy. it can plant anywhere in the abdominal cavity at that point. most of the time, it will die because it has to plant in a well vascularized region to be viable. sometimes, it finds a good, bloody spot, and starts growing there. at that point its essentially a tumor, and of it can eat enough into a blood vessel, in can rupture and bleed like shit. you would think that millions of years of evolution would create a fallopian tube that opens up right to the ovary, but thats not the case	9297	48199	bobtwf	enemxf7

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. most other animals who have a menstruation cycle, or something like it, reabsorb the uterine lining rather than shedding it out and causing woman to suffer from painful bleeding out of their vaginas for 5-6 days once a month. edit: i think that if we have to shed it, it should be a voluntary sphincter (like controlling when you pee). so woman dont have to spend so much money on pads & tampons, dont have to worry about bleeding through, can stress free wear a bikini, etc.	2731	48199	bobtwf	ened91u
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the absolute randomness in its strengths vs vulnerabilities. a person can jump from a plane, have their parachute not open & survive the impact. or you can slip in the shower, break your fucking neck, and die on the spot.	27671	48199	bobtwf	eneccni
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	my schlong is more like a schlort	20544	48199	bobtwf	enefjy3
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the pain and complications associated with giving birth. giraffes can birth a whole tiny giraffe hooves and all and go about their day, yet women are still enduring massive amounts of pain (and/or death) during childbirth. it seems evolutionarily unproductive.	1265	48199	bobtwf	eneqh8m
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	wisdom teeth. they were useful when we used to have bigger jaws, but now they often cause pain and infection	958	48199	bobtwf	enegij5
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	we're physiologically built to have sex with as many people as possible as soon as we hit puberty, but practically, socially, and psychologically, that's a *really* bad idea.	5535	48199	bobtwf	ened71t
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	physician here. 1) testes only work when they are located outside the body at the junction of two limbs that converge, funneling many stray objects towards them. 2) the low back. omg. dont get me started. 3) clotting is so complex its no wonder it messes up so often. 4) sinuses. like.why? and why do the holes leading into them need to be so small? 5) the immune system is really bad at stopping things it needs to stop and its really good at damaging the body. 6) we evolved on this planet, so why is the light of the sun too bright for us to tolerate? 7) our bodies like to store fat.in our arteries? 8) sometimes, the babys head wont fit through the pelvis. 8a) even by mammal standards, our newborns are remarkably ill-equipped. a newborn dog can crawl. a newborn horse can walk. we take a year to walk and almost two decades until we can fend for ourselves. ill think of more.	642	48199	bobtwf	enf887o
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the genitals arent protected by any bones and are utterly fragile.	1143	48199	bobtwf	ene6xpz
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	teeth cannot repair themselves (i think?). if a bone can heal back together why the hell can't a tooth fill in a micro hole. in a natural state, teeth are pretty dam important. edit: just want to say thanks to all for the upvotes. it does not go unappreciated. may we all have perfect teeth forever.	15082	48199	bobtwf	ene95hn
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the fact that theres so many things you can do to the human body without killing it but _oh fuck slept wrong and pinched a nerve now im fucking paralyzed_ (didnt happen to me, but happened to a semi distant family member a year ago) edit: holy fuck this comment took off edit 2: to everybody getting paranoid in my replies, dont worry: he was sleeping in a crowded camper on a small couch in a very, very awkward position this isnt a very common thing, but it does happen to people. so long as you sleep relatively well you shouldnt have a problem. edit 3: apparently reddits full of health experts who know for a fact that you cant do this. he pinched and severed something in his spinal cord from what i remember, im not 100% sure if it was a nerve but idk what else it would be tbh. _either way the point i was trying to convey was this man went from sleeping to paralyzed, so._	14896	48199	bobtwf	enek3iy

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	cranial and neck structure. one wrong bump of the head and you can suffer serious injury or death.	428	48199	bobtwf	ene7785
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	our lumbar and ass aren't really that great at holding us up and this is why everyone has back problems regardless of whether they spend their lives working out, sitting in a chair, or in between. evolutionarily, we should have spent more time in trees waiting for our muscles and such to develop more to support the greater half of our bodies being held upright without destroying the system that's meant to do exactly that.	1078	48199	bobtwf	enejywk
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	over-storing fat. i mean, i get hanging onto 20 pounds of the stuff just in case you need to tap into that energy - but at 50, 100, 300 pounds our bodies are still like well better still stock up, you never know if well find any food this upcoming year.	2950	48199	bobtwf	enee4js

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the female reproductive system. the urethra is too close to the anus/vaginal opening. this can cause lots of utis if we aren't careful. our hips are nearly too narrow to birth our babies. we can literally split our vagina into our anus while giving birth. also the monthly bleeding thing, i'm fucking over it and i've still got a good 20-30 years of it left. it's a damned inconvenience on it's best days and a nightmare of literal blood and pain on its worst days.	265	48199	bobtwf	enf3o43

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	birth and pregnancy are way too tasking on a woman. like, other animals can hunt, run, play, etc. literally hours before having to give birth, can get up right afterwards, don't have to take care of their kids for years, and their babies, y'know, actually fit when they're being birthed. we literally can't even give birth right. women used to die all the damn time before we made medical advances because our bodies are not fit to birth our own children, which *biologically*, is the entire fucking point of life.	214	48199	bobtwf	enf25xu
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	too many teeth in too little space. gets easily fucked up, and you keep randomly biting your tongue/lips/cheeks somehow	70	48199	bobtwf	enego9f
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the brain hardware has some compatibility issues with the software. i.e. patch random boners, agression instinct, need for attention, staring at boobs and affection for shiny stuff then we can talk.	968	48199	bobtwf	ene9xmd
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	the long start-up time from birth to functioning at the bare minimum.being housebroken, able to communicate, walk etc.	137	48199	bobtwf	eneezvd

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	compensation: an extreme example. problem in one part of spine, muscles on the other side start to compesate. pelvis becoms misaligned because back is not functioning symmetrically. now, spinal problem has made the entire back spasm to support, walking hurts, probably more prone to headaches now, etc.	64	48199	bobtwf	enf06ap

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	as someone who has been pregnant to term three times. the whole pregnancy experience is completely flawed. whoever designed the female body for carrying and birthing children should be fired.	100	48199	bobtwf	enez8h6
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	limited amount of telomeres &#x200b; edit: i didn't know that excessive telomeres or abnormally durable telomeres increase the likelihood of cancer. i should have just said mortality, nature can sort that shit out. i was under the impression that longer or more durable telomeres = longer lifespan, til.	211	48199	bobtwf	eneiqxp
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	babies, in general. most all other babies are born and are fairly self sufficient or minimally dependent (with exceptions for certain animals i admit), but human babies are just crying poop machines for like ~3 years.	51	48199	bobtwf	enen7co
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	aging. &#x200b; last i checked, living is 100% fatal so let's fix that.	238	48199	bobtwf	enefg19
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	humans are the only mammals where the birth canal is too small to properly give birth to offspring. child birth isn't supposed to be painful, difficult, or time consuming. however, due to humanity's evolution to bipedal-ism, the pelvis shrunk and reshaped itself for a standing position. this change allowed humanity to become more mobile and flexiable, but at a serious cost.	89	48199	bobtwf	eneyw6g
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	where neovascularization (new blood vessel growth) of the eye takes place. youre diabetic and your retina isnt getting enough oxygen? lets make new blood vessels on top of the retina and cause things like retinal detachments. youve got macular degeneration and need more oxygen too? lets grow some under your retina and make you need shots in your eye. the front of the eye also can develop new blood vessels but this commonly takes place in the angle (the drainage area for aqueous). this leads to extremely high eye pressure and glaucoma.	117	48199	bobtwf	enejw8w

what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	periods. ~~here i am, trying to make her mayor of wangtown, and i pull out with rudolph the red nose dickdeer on my pelvis.~~ i find it odd that we evolved so that a fair chunk of half the species is in debilitating pain 1/4 of the month.	129	48199	bobtwf	enegf72
what is, in your opinion, the biggest flaw of the human body?	how we cant control every aspect of our brain, cause if we would we could just be like hey yo body, start growing muscle and your body would just be like alright ill get on that.	108	48199	bobtwf	enegytu

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"my fiance and i had broken up within the last week and was still dealing with that horribly. i was on pain meds for my shoulder and was scheduled for surgery in the current week. the day of the surgery, i was to get a nerve block, the anesthesiologist was the one performing the nerve block. he and i were chit-chatting, and he was just a really comforting person. he was telling me about everything that was going to go on during the surgery. then we were just chit-chatting about life when the topic of the break-up came up. he was even comforting with that. so after that, i was wheeled into surgery. he was there to put me under, which for some reason put me at great ease. as i was going under, i guess i started talking through the mask and he lifted the mask to hear what i was trying to say. when i boldly stated ""i still love you <fiance's name>"" while holding direct eye contact with him. i didn't know i did it. not until he visited me in recovery. he said ""thanks for the nickname."" then told me what i said. i guess the entire surgical staff referred to him by my fiance's name for the duration of the surgery. so not only did i call this poor guy a woman's name that stuck with him for the duration for the surgery, i stated how much i loved him to boot. when i went back for the second surgery, guess who my anesthesiologist was? regardless of my foul-ups, he is an awesome anesthesiologist and really good at his job."	12314	61851	bri3ja	eoeajkm

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	might be late, but i have a story. i got my wisdom teeth removed at 16. i grew up in a small, remote, white canadian town. we had to travel to a slightly larger, slightly less remote town to visit the hospital there for the procedure. the new anesthesiologist there was a very nice chinese doctor whose family had just moved up from the city. now, and this is important later, i had just returned from a year away - i spent a year of high school as an exchange student in taiwan and had only gotten back a few weeks earlier. procedure happens, nothing major goes wrong, and i come to in a hospital room in a fair bit of pain but mostly fine. my dad had driven me to the hospital and came in to see me and get me up to take me home. the minute he saw me, he burst in to a laughing fit and i could tell from his face that he'd been laughing about as hard as anyone could laugh. once he finally found his composure, he explained to me what had happened: the anesthesiologist and a nurse came out in to the waiting room after i was put under and apparently were white as ghosts. my dad asked if anything was wrong, and eventually the anesthesiologist, still in a daze, explained to my dad that after he administered the anesthesia (but before i was fully out of it) i began speaking to him in fluent mandarin and that he thought maybe he needed to call someone to ask how it's possible that this redneck white teenager could suddenly gain the ability to speak chinese under anesthesia. needless to say, my dad thought this was hilarious and explained (to the doctor's relief) that the white kid did already know how to speak mandarin and that he hadn't damaged my brain somehow.	8882	61851	bri3ja	eoearra

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	i was delusional after a real long l&d trying to give birth to twins. finally there was a shift change and i got a new anesthesiologist who basically told me i wasnt going to feel anything for a good 24 hrs. i dont know what he gave me but he was right. things turned emergency style and my husband got kicked out of the room, but my new best friend anesthesiologist held my hand while my babies were delivered. after that i tried to convince my husband to forgo our previous naming plan and call our son the name of the anesthesiologist. my husband was like youre on drugs were not doing that, but i continued to call my son by that name for probably the first 18 hrs of his life. i really hope that anesthesiologist remembers me as fondly as i remember him. edit: thank you for the kind person who gave me gold! i couldnt have done it without my husband, my children, and of course, the anesthesiologist.	4350	61851	bri3ja	eoec0pj

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	im an anesthesiologist assistant. propofol is the standard drug of choice to knock patients out for surgery. there is a short window of time after the propofol hits where people are still lucid enough to talk, maybe 20 seconds tops. as i started to push a full syringe of propofol into his iv, one of my patients asked me if i wanted to hear him sing his alma maters war hymnhis way of giving me a hard time because i went to a rival college. i couldnt refuse. it sounded like this: good luck to dear old aggies/ they are the boyyyyys thatttttt-narrrr.hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.nnn. .at which point his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he stopped breathing. got to commend his fighting spirit, though. edit: yes, a big dose of propofol makes you stop breathing. if nothing is done about it, you probably never breathe again (think michael jackson). anesthesia providers are trained to breathe for you; either temporarily via a mask, or via a breathing tube and ventilator. in this case i intubated him and put him on the vent. all standard procedure and he did great. edit 2: changed it to war hymn even though i swear he called it the battle hymn.also, hook em! 	4474	61851	bri3ja	eoe6cio

"when i got my wisdom teeth removed, the last thing i remember is looking up at the nurses/assistants who were talking and i said to one of them, ""hey, you have a british accent!"", they all started laughing and then i was out. apparently when my mother was paying or whatever up front, i was in a wheelchair just basically screaming ""fuck you, fuck this, and fuck that"" to anyone who would listen. the front personnel thought it was funny and told my mom it happened more often than she'd think, but she wasn't amused and wheeled my ass to the car and went back in. the first thing i remember was coming to in the car calling my best friend leaving a voicemail with a mouth full of bloody gauze all doped up. she kept that message for like 6 years and played it for everyone.it was.not one of my prouder moments. on the plus side, when i went back for my checkup, all the nurses spoke to me in horrible british accents to fuck with me, but the one i had said it to originally was in fact british, so i guess it wasn't a total loss."	87	61851	bri3ja	eoebhv9

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"as a patient having a closure device implanted in my heart (atrial septal defect), i had to remain awake during the procedure but was blissfully mostly unaware of what was going on. i do remember the monitor showing the camera feed and the doctor talking and asking me questions here and there. mostly though, i remember very cheerfully telling the nurse to my left about all of my pet rats, all their names and their personalities. i recall that she was very sweet and encouraging, keeping me babbling about what made me happy rather than the fact i was having surgery. strangely, later on in recovery when i was coming out of it, i became an emotional wreck and vaguely recall a nurse having to restrain me, and i made demands for my then husband to bring ""madea"" to me immediately. when another nurse called him to ask about my request, he informed her that he would not do that, because madea was a rat and hospitals dont really welcome those. i dont know what came over me to be that way or why i demanded that specific rat. i did eventually calm down i guess, i dont really remember much beyond my arms being held down to stop me from pulling off everything that was attached to me."	63	61851	bri3ja	eoeaoup

anesthesiologists, what are the best things people have said under the gas?	"my story is actually about a funny/scary conversation between the surgeon and the anesthesiologists when i was going under. i'm a japanese-speaking american living in japan, and had talked extensively with my surgeon before the operation, but not with the anesthesiologists (another doctor took all the necessary info for them). so they came into the room speaking broken english at me while the surgeon spouted on in japanese. as they started to put me down, i turned over to the very cute lead anesthesiologist, told her a bunch of pervy shit i can barely remember in japanese, then she got all flustered and said to the doctor in japanese, ""why didn't you tell us he knew japanese! we studied for this!"" i laughed until i passed out, then woke up to a world of pain with no pain meds available other than ibuprofen up the butt."	296	61851	bri3ja	eoe83sj
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	about 15 years ago, i worked as a deckhand on a line of boats that took people out to fort sumter. the trip was about an hour each way. one day, we were about halfway there and two teenagers decided it would be fun to jump off and try to swim to shore. this is in charleston harbor, which has a pretty solid tidal current, lots of boat traffic, and probably more sharks than one would like to think about. we ended up having to perform a water rescue on them. then continued on to the fort, with the coast guard coming and picking them up. all in all, an extreme act of stupidity.	1105	52334	bq2sd5	eo0w7ol

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i used to work at a heritage site. it was an old military installation with a lot of remaining original structures (bunk beds, cafeteria equipment, computers etc.). everyday it was a constant effort to remind people (read: kids) not to jump on the beds, not to slam doors open, not to punch every button like it owes them money. the absolute worst was a group of kids on a school trip. within the first ten minutes we're walking through the tech portion of the exhibit, where we had a wall lined with burroughs large systems machines (b5000's), all behind this little fence about waist-high. i turn to demonstrate some of the pieces, and when i look back at the group one of them had jumped over the barrier, opened one of the units and started pulling out handfuls of digital tape from the reels inside. i just about jumped on the kid when their teacher did just that. she jumped the barrier, smacked the kids hands and took him outside. i immediately ended the tour and had them all refunded, as i couldn't imagine what else could happen.	9153	52334	bq2sd5	eo0sv4n

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked at a living history farm museum. i had a kid that was climbing on stuff the whole tour in the farm house and trying to get behind the smith in the blacksmith shop during a demo. after the tour when people are allowed to roam the grounds, i hear his mom screaming and look over to the barn and this kid has climbed the fence into the field with our long horn oxen and is trying to poke them with a stick. i walk over and calmly told him to get out of the field before our lazy oxen decide they've had enough, but this jack off decides to look me in the eye and smack ted on the ass with the stick like it's a riding crop. ted, bless him, just kinda jumps a little and whips his head around with a wtf dude look on his face. but seeing as he's a long horn, he just wipes this kid out with one of his horns when he turned his head. kid goes flying into the dirt and is having a melt down. mom is freaking out. i'm like dude, get the hell out of the pen before ted actually gets mad. so this kid is crying and trying to climb the fence out of the field and bill, who has been watching this whole thing waits until the kid is almost over the fence and walks up to him and nudges him in the ass with his nose and pushes him off the top of the fence. it was everything i could do to keep from laughing. kid was fine, ted was fine, but the kid and his mom were promptly kicked out of the museum. their dad and little sister were allowed to stay because she was well behaved and was just enjoying petting the goats at the petting zoo. so since the kid had to leave but his sister didn't there was a temper tantrum in the parking lot that could be heard all the way to the other side of the farm. but the oxen got some extra grain that night, so i guess they won in the end.	30661	52334	bq2sd5	eo0vxb2

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i once was a tour guide in high school for a group of young chinese students coming to the rural us on a sort of fresh air trip. they told us beforehand that we had to keep the kids away from water because apparently parents dont value swimming lessons in china and there is such little open swimmable water that no one learns on their own. we were also told that the kids think swimming happens naturally  like if you go into water, youll immediately start swimming. anyways, one of our excursions was to a local reservoir and the plan was to hike up a hill nearby to overlook the reservoir lake, get a few photos, and then leave. when we got to the top, it started pouring rain like i had never seen before. im talking so much rain you cant see 5 feet in front of you. then lightning starts striking the lake and im still trying to keep it cool even though i had never been so close to lightning before. the students were taking it well and laughing, which was good, until they started running _directly for the lake_ and *jump in*. apparently they had also never learned about electricity conducting through water, so im freaking out and start pulling them out of the water (they werent in very far) and a couple of them complain that their phones were wet. in the rain. no one got hurt, but it was a crazy day. we got back on the bus and the kids started drinking liquor in the back (they ranged ages 9-16) and i had to bust them for that too. tl;dr: apparently chinese kids think swimming will just happen if you go in water, especially lightning-struck water	783	52334	bq2sd5	eo0z34t

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	tour guide/boat captain in the caribbean. we had about 40/50 people on the boat, got off. we would normally go feed swimming pigs which someone would get nipped from them from doing stupid shit but nothing too serious. well the next stop after that was another island where we would hand feed turtle, sharks, and stingrays. so we would tell the people to hold it with the the palm open and food in the middle for the stingrays and they would come over the top and take it out. the turtles and the sharks put it in the water holding it in the tips and when they are coming for it let go. well of course, this dingus decided he would be tough and feed this baby shark, no longer than your forearm without letting go. shark proceeds to bite his fingers, he screams and jumps up out of the water and flicks it off of his hand, pulling one of his finger nails off in the process. so that's one i always remember.	4913	52334	bq2sd5	eo0uf02
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not my story, but co-worker's story. he was a tour manager for south america. we tend to work with the more older travelers (60ish and above). him and his guests were flying from lima to cuzco, peru which is about 10,000ft in elevation. this is a group of around 40ish travelers. apparently, he had one male guests who had ibs or something, and while in mid-flight shat himself. the stench was unbearable as they are all in a small aircraft carrier taking them to cuzco so high in the mountains. he said he had to help escort this guy to the bathroom in the back, but as he stood up, the shit just came down his leg. so now, he's dragging shit with him to the toilet. once he got to the toilet, he cleaned it up with the assistance of the aircraft attendant. he was very embarrassed, but not as embarrassed as the guy who poo'ed himself. once they landed, this guy who shat himself is in the bathroom, apologetic, and was cleaning himself up. the guide went into the airport and bought him some new peruvian style pants and then came back to the airport to help dress this guy in the bathroom. i would say that was probably one of the worst stories i have heard happen to an individual. i have also heard of a fellow co-worker who guides tourism in vietnam, had to bail out a tourist from jail one time. she received a phone call in the middle of the night from him, in jail, asking for help. she showed up and ask the man, what happened? the vietnamese police said he was caught purchasing viagra and exchanging money for prostitution.	257	52334	bq2sd5	eo0weiy

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	my cousin is a tourist guide and biologist, most of his tours are in africa. he instructed his group of 20-25 people including kids not to wear any type of earrings or collars especially shiny stuff since they were about to go into a thick forest to try to see a bunch of animals. this is very important because 20-25 make a lot of noise which makes wild animals run away or hide, it's even worse if they're wearing shiny stuff they can spot from far away. ok so this woman complains, decides to wear shiny earrings anyway, cousin tells her to get rid of them or she ain't coming with the group so she obeys but puts them on a bit later. some species of monkeys in that area love shiny stuff. they ripped the earrings from her ears. edit: ok i wasn't ready for the inbox nukes. yes my username makes everyone cringe. shaving your teeth is a truly enlightening experience! make sure to sleep properly so you don't wake up too tired and end up picking your razor instead of your toothbrush when you brush/shave your teeth :d	19255	52334	bq2sd5	eo0woln

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	we're pretty good at stopping tourist from doing too much damage. after being in the industry for a while you get a spidey sense for when people are going to do dumb things and can often steer them away from doing anything too bad. that being said, here's one of my favourite stories to tell. i was 7 months pregnant and it was the week before i went on maternity leave. i was driving out to one of our sites and to get there i had to drive (on the road of course) through our penguin colony. this particular species of penguin burrows underground and stays hidden in their burrow during the day, and comes out at night when birds of prey and other potential predators have gone to sleep. as i'm driving out to the site i realise the parking lot up ahead is full and people have started parking up and down the road. and that's when i see a giant suv pull off the road, drive between the bollards and into the penguin colony. i pull over as what seems like 20 non-english speaking tourists start to pile out of the vehicle and take selfies with the ocean backdrop. staying as calm as possible and using sign language i point out the no entry signs of the bollards they drove past, the burrows they have just collapsed, inform them they may have killed penguins, and to get their fucking vehicle out of the fucking colony. once i got them out of there i started digging out the collapsed burrows to check for penguins. the first four were luckily empty but the last one had a breeding pair. i get the girl out, check her over for injuries, and having no where else to put her i follow protocol and tuck her under my left arm against my side. i get the boy out and put him in the same position on the right side and start to check him over. remember how i said i was pregnant? well normally, you hold a penguin down low almost on your hip, but because of my round tummy i was holding him more at the bottom of my ribcage. so when i turned my head to start my health check, the bastard reached up and grabbed my top lip with his beak and ripped straight through the middle. it was about this time that the tourists walking along the road realised this ranger was holding onto two penguins. i had five or six tourists sprint through the colony towards me and start snapping pictures. while at the same time potentially collapsing more burrows. if any internet sleuths stumble across a picture of a heavily pregnant, pissed off looking ranger, holding two penguins with blood pouring down her face let me know. i've been waiting for that picture to show up for 3 years and haven't found it yet. happy ending, i chased away the photographers, popped the two uninjured penguins in a nearby unoccupied burrow, and radioed for back up to help with the parking situation. my lip healed without a scar, and both penguins left the following morning for a well deserved day in the ocean. tl;dr signage is there for a reason. rules are there for a reason. if you don't know what the reason is, doesn't mean you should break the rules. edits: real tl;dr tourists drove over penguin burrows. no penguins were harmed in the making of this story. just. glad people seem to appreciate the work we do with these super cute (vicious, and smelly) animals. they're worth every ounce of blood, sweat and tears!	13930	52334	bq2sd5	eo0t7ct

""i think my wife was killed by a lion."" gasp, shock. everyone is freaked out, asking him what happened, and as he's trying to explain, the now-irate wife walks up to the campsite and starts yelling. so what had happened? well, they'd walked off, and at some point near the toilets, they both heard a kind of snuffling noise in the underbrush, clearly an animal rooting around. the husband completely freaks out, pushes his wife towards the noise and *down to the ground*, screams, and runs away. spoiler alert, it was not a lion and the wife was not pleased at the attempts at being sacrificed. the guide told us that they didn't speak the entire rest of the trip and they he believes they got divorced. hilarious. tl;dr; don't shove your wife into the ground if you think there is a hungry lion in the underbrush just to save yourself. edit: because mobile."	2892	52334	bq2sd5	eo0wabr
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	was at a reptile show and they let out some mini crocodile iguana type thing. i think it was called a dragon something? anyway some kid decides to take his shoe off and wiggle his toes through the small rope gate we were against. presenter says watch your kid, these will bite. kid removes his foot and immediately puts it back in when presented turns around, wiggles his toes again, and this dragon thing *surges* forward and clamps down. kid starts screaming, presenter just looks on like well i told you so and removes it. kid stops screaming, no-one says anything, and presenter moves on. thats what you get for ignoring instructions, and also for not parenting properly. **edit: okay guys i really doubt it was a komodo dragon since the presenter really wasnt worried about it, please stop commenting saying the kid is dead or something. as others have pointed out it was probably a monitor, a chinese water dragon, or a bearded dragon. it was big enough so a monitor sounds correct. i dont need anyone else commenting about whether it was a komodo dragon and whether the kid got help or not. his sock almost came off and he got a fright, thats all, kid was fine**	6637	52334	bq2sd5	eo0tsuo

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was a tour guide at a historic village museum (similar to colonial williamsburg). the worst thing was the blatant sexual harassment by some older male visitors towards our female guides (some who obviously look under 16) who wear the old fashioned dresses. you'd be surprised how many men on group tours openly ask our staff members to show them what's under their dress, talk about how it used to be acceptable to marry girls under 16 and how they wish it was still acceptable, or make pretty gross sexual remarks about our staff members in front of the group and i. when you would call them out on their behavior as being inappropriate they would act like you were wrong for getting offended by it and that we should accept it since we were demonstrating life in the 18th century. i heard and saw some pretty bad stuff which would make both the other guests and staff uncomfortable. it also wasn't uncommon for people to sneak away from the tour group to go into restricted areas in an attempt to hunt the ghosts which are supposedly on the property. theres a reason those places are out of bounds, there can be irreplaceable artifacts we don't want accidentally damaged, tools, or the area hasn't been cleared by the fire marshal to allow guest access. small things have been broken by people doing this. people love to get confrontational about being told they can't go into restricted areas or touch the artifacts despite all the signs hung up.	622	52334	bq2sd5	eo0um59

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	during my summers in college, i worked as a raft guide on a whitewater river in the southeast. it wasnt a difficult job; the two biggest things we were responsible for were running our trips in a timely manner and ensuring that the guests in our boat had a fun and safe trip down the river. the safety part is important, because people visiting the river frequently forget that it is a natural wilderness feature and carries all of the associated dangers. we frequently received questions about whether the rafts were on tracks, whether i actually had to do anything in the back, and (my personal favorite) whether the river went in a circle and we would end up back where we started. this last question was particularly funny because we took a bus from the rafting outpost to the put-in of the river  why bother if we were going in a circle?! one summer afternoon, i had a boat with three groups of two people; one of those groups was a mother and son. the mother seemed nice, if timid, as did the son. however, as i was going through the routine of explaining the safety concerns and paddle commands, it started to dawn on me that he was not very bright. there was nothing wrong with him  he was just dumb as shit. once we were on the river, he almost immediately developed a habit of checking the depth of the water with his paddle. he would incessantly plunge the blade into the water without care nor concern for his surroundings and circumstances. the water on this river is pristine. almost crystal clear. the riverbed is visible almost constantly, and still, this young man felt the need to verify the veracity of his own eyeballs by shoving his paddle into the river like some sort of deranged perpetual motion machine. of course, i warned him against his actions. at first, my concerns were that his depth-checking interferes with his ability to follow my commands and paddle. eventually, however, my pleading grew more desperate as it dawned on me that this child paid no deference to my authority. he answered only to chaos. it finally came to a head when, in a portion of the river that was extremely shallow (probably no more than a foot deep), he plunged his paddle into the riverbed with a force that shook the surrounding countryside. like excalibur, the paddle wedged itself among the rocks, perfectly erect. the boy, with a staid iron grip that could only be wielded by someone incredibly dense, kept his hand on the paddle as the rushing water carried us away from its new location. in one swift motion, he was wrenched from the raft and landed in a foot of water. he wore a face of bewildered idiocy. it was quite satisfying to keep his paddle in the back with me for the remainder of the trip after i returned him safely to the raft. all he could do was stare wistfully at the riverbed, his poo brain longing to verify its depth.	9239	52334	bq2sd5	eo0v3ga

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"i'm a guide for a popular mainstream brewery. the way tours work there, we always have two guides per tour: one leading and one closing the group, for safety reasons. when we greet people, part of our spiel consists in pointing out the fact that the only toilets are located at the entrance - so right where we are standing at the moment - and the pub at the end of tour. we also make it very clear that no one should at any point be behind the closing guide, no matter what. both of these will be important later on. so, on the day this happened, the other guide and i were alternating between leading and closing. we greeted our group of ~25 people and noticed there was a little boy of around 4 there with his parents. this wasn't the first time something of the sort happened, but i'll never understand why people feel the need to bring their children and even babies to a brewery. much less one that is advertised as being difficult to walk around. oh well. we leave with our group and everything is fine until we reach the brew room. at this point, while my colleague is explaining the beer making process, the father approaches me saying that his son needs the toilet. i tell him that we are close to the pub and ask if he can wait five minutes so we could all leave the brew room together, or if he'd rather the three of us leave for the pub immediately and rejoin the group later on. he answers ""nevermind"" and rejoins the group. after a minute or so, i hear the door to the room opening and closing, this is a big no-no of course, because we need to always be aware of where everyone is. so, i go to investigate and find the father holding his son while he pees around the corner. fml"	191	52334	bq2sd5	eo0xc6s

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	former horseback tour guide. i have a ton of stories, but the one that sticks with me the most was this lady visiting from new york city. it started when she got out of her car. we tell everyone to wear a shoe with a heal, that helps keep your foot from falling forward through the stirrup. this lady gets out sporting knee high leather boots with 4 heels. she didnt bring any other shoes. i thought, ok, we can make this work, whats the worst that can happen. i put her on the horse and she isnt following directions. she doesnt want to hold the reins or try to control the horse. the horse realizes this and is trying to eat everything in sight. so i get everyone else on their horses, then put this lady directly behind me. once you start moving, the horses know what to do and will just follow me unless you tell them otherwise. pretty foolproof. after about 15 minutes, we get to a place where we try to trot, which is like a slow jog (8mph instead of 4mph). we start to trot, and this lady just starts screaming. she lets go of the reins, grabs the saddle horn and just is screaming at the top of her lungs. her horse is a former racing track horse, hears the screaming and thinks, that means its time to go fast! and they just fly past me. so im at a full gallop chasing after this lady, yelling at her to pick up the reins, but my yelling mixed with her screaming is just making the situation worse. i finally get up next to her and try to get her to calm down and grab the reins. shes still screaming her lungs out, looks over at me and instead decides to grabs onto me. now, when two horses are side by side running, they think oh, were racing. we start picking up as much speed as possible, but her horse is faster than mine and this lady has a death grip on my arm; she isnt letting go. her horse slowly starts pulling away from me and she slowly slides off the back, hits the ground and just rolls. shes covered in mud, but otherwise unscathed. i grab her horse and am able to talk her into getting back on. i gave her a quick lesson and the rest of the trip went off without a hitch, but holy hell.	157	52334	bq2sd5	eo1cpsh

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide, but my family and i took a tour in dominica that took us through a cavern. the highlight of that tour was to show us a beautiful waterfall that has sunlight peeking through. the tour guide told us a million times before going into the cavern and when we were inside to stay on the edge and not try to go too close to the middle because people have been sucked under and died there. some idiot ignored him regardless in hopes to take a selfie there and couldnt get out, so the tour guide in frustration had to risk his own life to save that moron. i hope that jerk tipped him extra at the end for saving his life.	140	52334	bq2sd5	eo0yrhh

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"i used to give ""naturalist boat trips"" through a coastal area in florida. very slow, see dolphins, learn history, see lots of birds and learn about them, horseshoe crabs, island ecology, etc. i would usually start as we left the dock by talking about some of the small commercial fishing boats there and how they worked. then, on to the history of the area. by this time people would typically be asking questions. one nice young couple said. nothing. other than saying hello when they got on the boat -- and they were the only ones on the boat -- they said.nothing. i had no idea what to do. did they hate it? did they love it? should i keep talking? should i shut up? i was sweating bullets. so i more or less talked for the first hour (not constantly, but some.) and for the second hour, i didn't say a word. i figured if they wanted to say something or ask a question, they would. the only sound for that last hour was the low hum of the boat engine and the occasional loud bird. at the dock, they thanked me and gave me a tip and walked away. to this day, i still can't figure out what was going on, but it was my most memorable time as a guide."	4049	52334	bq2sd5	eo0r457

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i was an educator in a museum and we had a summer camp for middle school kids. one day we got to take them on a tour of the roof where we had a garden and a cool view. it was 9 stories up. some of the boys were tossing gravel over the sides so i had to hover near them to get them to behave. then as we were waiting for the single elevator to head down, this big boy (he was probably no more than 11 but was the size of a 16 year old) decides he doesnt wanna wait for the elevator anymore. he grabs the outer doors and pries them open. fortunately, elevator doors are two layers for this very reason. we were not looking down the elevator shaft, but at another set of doors. but that caused the elevator to be unable to open on our level. so then i had to take a group of 20 rowdy 11 year olds down 9 flights of stairs. overall at that job i gave museum tours to hundreds of groups of kids and their parents and without a doubt i can say the parents were more trouble than the kids.	124	52334	bq2sd5	eo0y67m
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	as one of the comments mentioned above. i am also a white water rafting guide. i had a group of friends from india. it was two newly weds and two other couples. i tried to be as gentle as possible in the river, after i asked if they knew how to swim and they gave me less than enthusiastic responses. unfortunately right before one of the biggest rapids on the river the newly wed wife decided it was time to try and take a group selfie on her go pro and fell into the water. this is no big deal as im trained for this. normally. what i didnt expect was for 4/6 people in the boat to jump out after her. keep in mind none of these people can swim. so im down to 2 people + me in a raft, floating into a giant, rocky, semi dangerous rapid. i only have one rope to throw, and they are all screaming. i wasnt able to get everyone back in my boat until after the next 2 rapids, about a mile down river. luckily they only had minor cuts and bruises. listen to your raft guide and never jump in after someone who fell out!	121	52334	bq2sd5	eo15gv6
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but i was on a tour of auschwitz a few months ago. as you can imagine it's a very solemn place. because it's the final resting place of so many people, they ask visitors to stay respectful throughout the whole place - no selfies, no joking, no phones, no talking above a whisper, even no talking at all in some areas. because of this the whole place has has a very somber feel, almost like a funeral. &#x200b; a group from another european country that was going round at the same time of us didn't follow these rules. they were shouting to each other while walking around the concentration camp, talking on their phones, one guy through his gum on the floor, talking loudly even inside one of the still standing gas chambers (where ask you to be the most respectful), taking photos of each other posing outside the gas chamber, barbed wire fences and other macabre backdrops. when a tour guide would ask them to stop, they would for a time and then resume. &#x200b; it was an infuriating experience. our tour guide said that unfortunately it happens all the time and groups from that country specifically are the worst offenders. she'd personally had to stop a picnic on a grassy patch outside of the gas chamber.	236	52334	bq2sd5	eo0xb3e

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"i was a university tour guide (oddly enough today is reunion), anyway, one time i was giving a tour, and we got to the central quad of campus, which contains a statue of freud reading a book. as i'm in the middle of my spiel about the history of the square we are in and the history of our psych department, this one woman in the crowd seems transfixed on the book of the statue and is giggling. i glance over and notice what appears to be a log of human shit (by the size it was either human or a very large dog). i try to ignore it and keep my composure/to my script, internally praying that nobody says anything or asks me to explain. within a minute the one woman who was giggling starts moving her hand. i still remember that moment in slow motion as she reaches out, and without flinching just picks the shit up in her bare hands. i stop what i am saying in mid-sentence and i am just a deer in headlights at this point. the woman then looks up at me and in an oddly high pitched voice asks ""is this a poopie?"". i am now double stunned, hit with a one-two punch. i think it takes me a good 30 seconds to even physically react or respond to what just transpired. somehow my wiring resets and i go back into tour-guide mode, and i just as calmly as possible say ""maam i don't know what that is, but i suggest you don't touch it. if you would like to wash your hands we will be passing restrooms on our way to our next stop"". flash forward 4 or 5 years, post-college. i'm at a party with friends most of whom were from my college days, including a couple who i really didn't get closer to until after we graduated. well at this party we're telling stories of and reminiscing about some of our wilder exploits and one of my newer friends starts telling about how one of her friends from home was visiting for the weekend, got absolutely blasted on cheap vodka and thought it would be ""cool"" to take a steamer right down the spine of the book freud was holding. i stopped laughing. 2 and 2 had finally come together. i stopped her and asked ""what year was this? what month?"". she replied and it fit. that's when i said ""oh shit, it *was* a poopie"" and my older friends and i started cracking up. it this point we had to fill in new friend the above story, and how now we finally knew it was in fact a ""poopie"" and in fact was human."	354	52334	bq2sd5	eo10iqt
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but i was on a tour around auschwitz once where two youngish (18-20 year old) italians were taking selfies. a second thing that happened on that tour that wasn't particularly bad but was humbling was that there was an older english lady, who used a portable mobility scooter when the walking was too much, complained that some of the buildings didn't have access for it. the tour guide pointed out that that was because people who couldn't get up steps would have been gassed on arrival. **edit**: spelt auschwitz wrong **edit number 2** auschwitz seems to be getting a lot of shit for not having disabled access, it does. in this instance the ladies scooter could not enter this particular building as it didn't have a reverse and would not be able to turn around at the end of the building, there was a wheelchair ramp. auschwitz themselves say this on their website: *disabled. because of the need to preserve the historical authenticity of the site of the memorial it may be difficult for dissabled persons to move around the grounds and buildings. in order to help visitors with disabilities wheelchairs are available free of charge at the visitor service centre.*	6019	52334	bq2sd5	eo0p0wl

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	"i was a horse touring guide for 7 years and the shit i had ro deal with was ridiculous. the most xommon nonsense was wanting to have them and their 7 year old children run on the horses. they would purposfully smack the horses butt that their kid was on to get the horse to run. but the worst was a bus load full of asian tourists (12) came to ride. only one of them spoke english and he was about 9 years old. every time one of the girls got on a horse they would cry. i already knew this next hour to hour and a half was going to be hell so i decided to put a lead rope on the horse the kid who could translate was riding, and i had him stay with me the entire time. (there was another guide in the front) when we got out to the forest the kids father demanded that we stopped. he wanted me to take a picture of all of them after they got to the top of this super steep mountain. he starts kicking and smacking his horse and he is yelling at all of his family members to do the same before the kid even finishes translating what his father said. i asked the kid to tell them to stop. tell them no. the kid is trying but they are all turning up this hill and not listening. now these horses were well trained and mannered but they also will listen even though they have been trained to stay in line. so the father gets his horse going up this hill and smacks his horses butt one more time and his horse takes off up this mountain. idk if anyone has watched how a horse runns up a mountain but the almost hop. its not easy to stay on. the worst part is, about 7 of the 12 horses follow suite and start running up this mountain. the other guide and i look at one another in panic mode as all these peoples screams are fading up this hill. thankfully the other guide and i can think quick. she grabs the few remaining horses that didnt run as all of their riders are also screaming and crying and yelling. i decide i need the translator boy to stay with me so i tell him what i am going to do, how to hold on and i ask him if he thinks he can do it so we can go stop all these horses. he nods leans forward and holds on as i get both are horses running up the hill. when i reach the top 4 of the older horses had slowed down and were eating so i tell the boy to tell them to get off the horses. he replies they dont know how and are too scared i (try not to show my irritation) jump off my horse as i tell him to give them my instructions step for step. he does but they all shake their heads as they are death gripping the horn. thank god asians are usually light and small. i basicaly had to lift/drag them off of the horses. i told them all to start walking down the hill and go with the others. i tied up their horses to the nearest tree asked the boy to hold on tight again and took off looking for the others. i finally found a younger man and his wife(?) she was covered in pine needles with a few scratches on her arms and covered in dirt. the boy (i assume) asks what happened then tells me her horse went under a tree and she didnt fit. the mans horse was behind hers so it stopped barely missing her and he got off to help her. i again told them to start walking and i tie up his horse. so now i have 2 missing horses and 1 missing tourist. it took me and that boy 40 min to finally catch up and find his father. this poor boy was so embarrassed and worried and when we finally catch up to him and his horse and the riderless horse trailing behind he looks up and says ""ya, real cowboys now! huh son."" i grabbed this dudes reigns and told his son to tell him to get off of his horse now! i told him to follow us and have him walk behind my horse, his sons horse and the now 2 riderless horses tied in a pack line. the father was angry and kept talking to his son but his son was so mad at him he would not reply or even look back at him. the poor kids face was so red. the other guide had managed to get all the other riders and horses back to the stable by the time we got back and when i pulled that kid off of his horse i looked him in the eyes and i told him how thankful i was for him and how brave he was. i told him to stay strong and to hold his chin high because he did the right thing. i told him he was a hero and an excellent rider because that was a lot for a 9 year old kid to handle for his first time on a horse. that day was an unforgetable nightmare. but that kid was a champion."	94	52334	bq2sd5	eo1r900

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	im not a tour guide, but last summer i went to yellowstone, and you know all those signs that are everywhere that say not to walk on anything other than the pat because of how unstable the ground is? yeah well an asian tourist lost his hat from wind at grand prismatic (a surprising number of hats litter yellowstone), and he just walked off the wooden path to go get it. if he stepped in one wrong place he wouldve been boiled alive! also at yellowstone, i watched several children and their parents throw rocks and trash into morning glory. theres multiple signs pleading for people to not do that because its clogging the spring, and causing discoloration. there are 3 natural rainbow pools in the world, grand prismatic, morning glory, and the other is in sweden i think? dont quote me on that. but its idiots like these people that get parks shut down and ruin the beauty of nature for everyone!	90	52334	bq2sd5	eo13fok

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	not a tour guide but this happened while we were being given a tour of a milk packaging factory that we intended to shoot for a commercial. control was super tight, we needed special permission, sterilized suits, goggles and hair nets just to get inside. the director goes over to one side of the factory to check the lighting, see if it's a good angle to shoot. he photographs the whole place to keep as reference and then it happens. he drops his phone. into an open vat of milk. the factory had to shut down immediately. over 150.000 liters of milk had to be scrapped, the vats had to be washed and sterilized, the health inspector had to be called down so production could restart. it was an unmitigated mess and i have no idea how we were still allowed to shoot inside the factory after that. although each crew member had to get a one-hour training session before going in.	164	52334	bq2sd5	eo0xc3q
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in amsterdam as a pub crawl guide for 6 months a couple years ago. a normal night we could have between 50 and 80 people, however during the summer those numbers double. so one night we're still at the start point before the crawl starts and a big group of lads come to join. they were on a stag and clearly out for a mad one. the crawl would start with an hour of cheap beers and free shots from the guides, these lads tore through our supplies. as we start, they're all already pretty smashed but aside from being loud, they're fine. as the crawl progresses however, some of them started disappearing and reappearing. we would always warn the pub crawlers to not buy drugs from street dealers but we were busy with guiding and aren't babysitting anyone (unless they need it and i'd get them water and a safe way to where ever they needed to go). it's about the 4th pub (out of 6) and it's clear the lads on the stag are buzzing. half are smiling so brightly that you'd swear there was a literal supernova of lightbulbs going off in their heads, the other half are drooling through the smiles and gurning. it's at this point that shit took off. suddenly one of the lads had a massive stuffed eagle. he didn't have it at the beginning but now we had about 30 lads off their tits bowing and praising a massive stuffed eagle that one is holding over his head. one of the other lads shouts that they need to make an offering, and then throws his pint at it. this generates a huge laugh and then the lads all shower the eagle with booze. everyone is in hysterics at this point. then the first glass was smashed. i think it was an accident, but the next 30 glasses smashing wasn't. the lads went fucking insane, they started throwing chairs around the place and smashing glasses. a few fights break out as there's a bunch of other people in this pub who aren't taking their shit. amid the chaos, the guy with the eagle is still standing in the middle holding it up and beseeching everyone to be calm like the eagle. so at this point, the other guides and i looked at each other and shrugged and started moving the rest of the pub crawlers along, keeping all these people here wasn't going to help the situation. so we continued, until a few of the lads caught up down the street a bit. they tried to start a fight with a random passerby, but two of them got cleanly knocked out by the guy before the others backed down. more shit i have to deal with, so i tell my buddy to keep the crawl going and i called the ambulance. once the two lads were taken care of i took off and finished the crawl. the shittiest thing is what happened afterwards. one of the two lads, once arriving at the hospital, immediately took off and walked away, refusing help. the police picked him up and seeing he was fucked up, took him back to the hospital. he ran again, and again they picked him up and brought him in. they warned him that if he ran off again then he'd be sleeping it off in a cell, but of course he ran again. some point during the night this fella died in the cell of an overdose. he had taken some shite from a street dealer and was one of many who had died from some white powder heroin that was being sold as cocaine. tl;dr: died.	352	52334	bq2sd5	eo0x9ks
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	former horse trail guide. group of 6 on the trail, plus me at the rear for safety and our leader up ahead. the ride was a faster ride, meant to be for people who already had some experience riding and wanted excitement. old witch (ow) and her grandson of about 12 (gs) were 2 of the riders. ow disregards all safety rules from minute 1. we ask them to ride in single file and not overtake each other as horses tend to fight when they think theyre being overtaken. ow wanted to go both in front and behind of her gs and wouldnt take no for an answer. for the first 20 minutes she repeatedly kicked her horse forward and then took a photo, and then took him back behind gs. both horses were getting upset and gs was getting frightened because he did not have any riding skills at all and his horse was getting alarmed. this conversation happened: me: maam please keep your horse in its place in the line. your grandsons horse is getting upset and he isnt enjoying the ride because of that. ow: how long have you been riding? how old are you? me: im 18 and ive been riding for 12 years ma-am. ow: well ive been riding 40 years. thats a bit longer, dont you think? me: im sorry but these are our horses and im responsible for your grandsons safety. it isnt safe to keep overtaking him. she stopped the shenanigans for a bit. then we got to the fast part of the ride. theres a fire break - a long sand track by a fence - that we always used for a fast run. the horses knew it and rarely needed more than a little kick to go fast there. ow was behind gs at this point after finally stopping with her photographs. we stop before the fast part for a safety instruction which consists of you dont have to make the horse go fast, it will follow the leader, but feel free to give it a kick if it doesnt, and remember to lean back not forward, and try not to overtake. i swear to god ow looked back at me and smirked as my coworker said those words. ow was on a lovely, responsive horse. we would use this horse when 5 or 6 year old children were on beginner rides and he never ever played up. as soon as they got onto the fast strip, she literally booted him so loud that i could hear it like a drum. the horse was afraid and fucking took off at top speed - barrelling through the other riders, including ows grandson. two other riders had their horses swerve into tree branches and were knocked off. she put literally every person in the ride in danger. her grandson fell off. i helped him back up and he was crying and too afraid to even start going again, so i had to put him behind me, and ow in front of me so that ow could not possibly fuck up his horse any more. she then proceeded to ask my name and tell me she would get me fired. this made my day because i worked for my mum and also i had been fired literally 2 days earlier in an argument with my mum and i was back because she needed me. ow seemed pissed that i didnt care one bit. she never did complain about me though and her grandson was so sweet and really appreciated being behind me and not subject to her horse upsetting his. i felt so bad for the kid.	78	52334	bq2sd5	eo14ev3

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i spent a year in the korean dmz as a tour guide with a gun. my job was to bring vips safely up to the border for a visit and, ideally, safely back. usually these people were diplomats, generals, or heads of state.so generally well behaved. celebrities were trouble though, very entitled. the us womens soccer team was like herding cats and several of them were drunk, which is against the rules but i was told to ignore it. cant believe that wasnt an international incident. but the worst visitor i had was the lead singer of puddle of mud. the rest of the guys in the band were super nice and respectful but the singer was high on something and literally crossed the border into north korea with dprk guards about 10ft away. i was able to step onto the cement curb that marks the border, grab his belt, and yank him back into south korea.	72	52334	bq2sd5	eo14acj

tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	i worked in museums for ten years and saw plenty of horrors, usually kids being left to jump all over everything. i've tried to block much of it out but here are a few i remember;  a man loudly talking to his grandson about the exhibits in a very pompous tone who turned to me at a case of delicate 16c pieces, asking how he could open the case. wtf? oh yeah! take my keys and get your big maulers over everything why don't you! a broken china cup shoved into a drawer in the childrens edwardian style play kitchen. i was tidying up and the jagged pieces almost tore my inner arm open. a lady looking on as her grandson clambered all over a very expensive sculpture in the gallery which was part of a contemporary exhibition. i stood alongside her for a few moments, smiling sweetly and said 'lovely piece isn't it? a real investment at 30k' she soon got the little crotchgoblin out of it then. people complaining about the lighting in the gallery. each set of lights had to be set to particular levels depending on the piece it was shining on. 'i'm an artist myself and it takes hours to get the colours just right. what's the point if you can't see it properly?' well if you're an artist, flower, you'll know all about light damage won't you? on one occasion we had an amazing pre-raphaelite painting on loan. no guards, no barrier-you could get up close and personal to it-it was amazing! yep, you've guessed it. we had someone whinge the lighting then. i explained the reasoning and that the light levels were a condition of the loan and the insurance, but no. her needs are far more important than the conservation of a silly old painting. people trying to donate actual rubbish to the collections-connect four with half the pieces missing, that kind of thing-and getting very arsey when we politely thanked them for their trouble and advised that 'we actually already have one of those'. a teacher with absolutely no control over her class who were running around *screaming* and smacking into cases. in fact, i saw a couple of bullies with a little boy shoved up against one of the cases. this was a really small museum too, so it's not like she can't have noticed. when i spoke with her about it she did the 'children! behave or the lady is going to make us all leave!' no wonder she had no control if she never took any responsibility. finding a drug addict in a jacobean four poster bed because 'they were tired'. there are loads more, but these are the ones i can remember. i guess they seem pretty minor, but when you get the same scenario over and over, there's definitely cumulative frustration which lead to lower tolerance of the public!	132	52334	bq2sd5	eo0x2rd

""kind, funny, and generous"" are only three of the dozen words i could use to describe him. however. i'd sourced him some cocaine during my guide of the best bars and sights of the city we were in. well, i'd *subtly* said ""that guy in the hat is known as a cocaine dealer. other people have told me his blow is the best."". the trouble began when the cops came to close down some of the bars on this party-street. we were outside having a cigarette. i mean, the trouble didn't start then. the trouble really began when he threw a beer bottle at the wall, then started peeing on a police ute. please note, this is while there were approximately thirty armed police on the block. some had shotguns. some, rifles. all of them had at least pistols. a few even had batons. somehow, i managed to distract, apologize, and generally diffuse the situation. he started panicking, not least because he had about $500 usd in drugs in his pickets, but also swearing about ""these fucking pigs, i could buy them all off, they don't know me, i have more shit in my pocket than they earn in a month"". but thankfully the police within earshot did not speak english. i translated completely the opposite of what he said to me. i managed to persuade the nearest cops that this 'gentleman' was, while very drunk, sincerely apologetic for his urination. i told them i was taking him home. i would look after him. with my arm over his shoulders and still spewing apologies to the police in spanish, i said to him ""bro, shut up and walk, act drunk, do not yell, say nothing but your highschool-spanish words for apology, and walk with me and do not mention the things in your pocket again."". we made it to the corner. as we turned, some other police who obviously understood english got closer and started yelling at us to stop. i didn't stop. i pushed idiot-dj around the corner, then said"" run!"". we ran a few blocks. he tipped me $250usd, over two weeks wages for me at the time."	2281	52334	bq2sd5	eo0q8w7

"not a tour guides, but out guide had a few interesting ones to share. we went on a school trip to berlin and visited a stasi (secret police in the ddr) prison. our guides were all people who have been imprisoned there and thus could tell us about their experiences in specific rooms ect. as a little note, you don't get in a stasi prison by normal crimes. they were reserved for people who tried to get out of the ddr and into the west (like our guide), were sympathizers of the west and their allies, smuggled or relayed information to the west or just had a different ethnicity, orientation ect. our guide always asks the same question at the start of each tour: ""why was a flat iron factory next to a prison?"" it was so they could open and check the mail unnoticed. any money, letters planning a break out or criticizing the ddr were ""lost"" that way. money was usually pocketed and the letters destroyed. so one day this older dude gets it right within seconds and our guide was of course fairly surprised. when asked, the guy revealed that he worked in the factory. as a side note, people who worked in those prisons or factories were no ordinary citizens. they were high ranking stasi officers, extremely on the side of the government and thoroughly checked so non of the people who worked there let anything ""slip"" about the existence of such prisons (they were on ""government property"" and weren't charted so the general population wasn't aware of their existence or use) turns out this guy was a stasi officer and as such also partook in torturing prisoners and ""sympathizers"". he was there without a ticket and after they called the police and had him removed, they found out that he had a history of walking in on tours and negate whatever the guides said about the unfair government. he also was on probation for defiling a few holocaust memorials and would harass guides of such tours."	52	52334	bq2sd5	eo19ed0
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	worked at buckingham palace. 1. a woman once stood in front of a painting for several minutes, and then leant across the velvet rope and rubbed her face, vigorously, on the painting. think it was a rembrandt. 2. someone shat in a happy meal box and left it in the foyer. 3. changing a babys nappy/diaper on one of the gallery benches. other fun stuff includes: 1. demanding to ride the horses in the royal mews (the stables). 2. claiming to be a long lost member/secret lover of the royal family. 3. demanding to meet the queen (she doesnt spend summer at buck house, which is when its open to the tourists). 4. racially abusing non-white and non-british members of staff, and expressing surprise that the royals would employ terrorists. 5. joking about bringing a bomb through security. not the done thing when theres armed police around.	54	52334	bq2sd5	eo1e4hs
tour guides of reddit, what's the worst thing a tourist has ever done under your supervision?	college tour guide at the biggest medical school in the state. this girl was top of her class, had a full ride, everything laid out for her. were touring the anatomy labs as a group, the room is full of cadavers in body bags. its a creepy room. she asks can i take a selfie with one of them? i told her absolutely not, these were people and that would be incredibly disrespectful to them and their families. she nods like she understands, then when i turn my back, she unzips a bag, picks the guys head up, and snaps a selfie. obviously she was immediately removed from campus and her acceptance to medical school was revoked. the university was going to stop there, but she tagged the school in her instagram pic with the cadaver. they then notified every medical school in the country what she did. shell never be a doctor, all because of one selfie.	52	52334	bq2sd5	eo1urcn

what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	flea markets. yes, i know they still exist. the problem is that thanks to the proliferation of the internet, it's pretty difficult to find a good deal on much of anything, especially games. people check the prices on ebay and other places and just price around that. you could go to a dozen flea markets or pop up shops and the same game will be around the same price at every single one of them.	7153	42575	bvkru1	epqgd8d

what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss magazine stores / newsstands. part of my routine for years on fridays was a walk into the neighborhood newsstand on the way to work. i'd spend 15 minutes perusing the new stuff. i'd usually spend 20-30 bucks on 5-6 magazines. video game stuff, fortean times, games magazine, always that day's sf chronicle, whatever. most of those places are long gone. i suppose i spend less money on that stuff, but i miss it.	1009	42575	bvkru1	epqa3ls

what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	"the crappy little corner arcade. not a fancy beercade or a dave & busters, i'm talking an actual old-guy-with-a-half-smoked-cigar dingy-as-hell corner shop, grimy exterior, no maintenance or effort put in, dim lighting, and a whole bunch of aged arcade machines - never the newest release, always minimum a year old. the city's finest snack bar, offering little debbie snack cakes for 25 cents marked ""not for individual resale!"" and cans of store-brand soda sold warm out of the 12-pack. luxurious duck-tape covered barstools - but he splurged on black duck tape! no silver here, whoa-ho! no bill changer, just a disgusting bucket full of quarters that the machines get emptied into, into which he shoves his fist and grabs $5 worth to break the next customer's bill, some petri dish equivalent of the food chain and the circle of life in twenty-five cent form. that arcade. the real american arcade. not this ""fun center"" crap with tickets and prizes -- nope. just top five scores with names like ""ass"" ""fu"" ""dam"" ""poo"" and, of course, ""ass"" one more time."	837	42575	bvkru1	epqre2j

"the sears catalog. i used to love going through that as a kid around christmas and seeing what i wanted to ask santa for. what's stupid is sears could have been bigger than amazon since they already had a head start on the ""order from home"" business, but they just didn't embrace the internet and now sears is dying."	2235	42575	bvkru1	epq20qx
what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	all the small bookstores have disappeared in my city. even the second-hand bookstores which were my favourites. oxford bookstores are surviving somehow and everything else is a text book store. i understand ordering online is way more convenient (i do it as well) but i do miss the feel of being surrounded by books and thumbing through the pages and looking for one that might catch my eye.	354	42575	bvkru1	epq8dc5
what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	dz discovery zone edit - spelling (genuinely what i thought it was as a kid) also editing to add clarification - it connects with places ruined by the internet because the deeper we got into computer games/internet activity/raised compliance, the lower success places like this have. plus someone just stated dz discovery zone was purchased by blockbuster which went bankrupt because of the internet.	539	42575	bvkru1	epq4qfo

what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i was a little sad to see my local k-mart go. i went there around thanksgiving last year, just after they set up their christmas section. i don't know whether the plan was drawn up in some regional or national headquarters, or if it was a local effort. but somebody, somewhere, had put a lot of effort into making the christmas section at my local k-mart something pretty special. it was nice looking, lots of trees everywhere, toys, decorations on display, the works. and all i could think was that those had been set up just in time for the store to close down. made me sad a little.	127	42575	bvkru1	epqme8q
what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	magazines in general seem to be part of a bygone era. if you had a specialist interest or hobby a magazine subscription was the best way to keep in the loop and have a monthly dose of excitement. now internet communities are much more plentiful and specified but there's no longer the depth of information as when it was compiled by experts and promoted with beautiful pictures and layouts.	180	42575	bvkru1	epqjyf3
what business or store that was killed by the internet do you miss the most?	i miss the big, fat newspapers on sundays with all the ads for local sales. edit: it's not just that i miss the ritual of reading the sunday paper for all of its contents, good and bad. it's also that i miss how it was special. i grew up in the 1970s and 80s. back then there was just less stuff everywhere . i remember the excitement of visiting a city where you could find unique style and products. now, both online and in corporate stores everywhere you can get practically anything and everything in a matter of a quick trip or a click of a mouse.	734	42575	bvkru1	epq66y2

"right after college i moved to a new city by myself and i was having trouble meeting people. i ventured onto the city's subreddit and saw a meetup posted for a halloween pub crawl, so i decided to go. i told the group what costume i would be wearing and headed out. i got to the first bar a bit late, so i assumed the group had moved to the next one. the group saw me from the line for the next bar and called me over, but just as they did two very shady-looking guys who had apparently been following me since the last bar popped up from behind me and told me they were here to ""take me to the party."" one of the members of the reddit group i was going to meet stepped forward and said ""no, this is our friend, she's with us, you two can leave."" so, essentially a group of reddit strangers saved me from real-life strangers. that was five years ago, and the group i met that night and i are still super close even though only about half of the original group still lives in the same city. we groupchat and/or roast each other every day. i also met my so of 3+ years through the group, so thanks to reddit not only did i not get kidnapped but i also met most of my favorite people in the world."	18597	28060	bqltzq	eo62ec0
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"my now-husband and i both responded to a thread looking for players for a particular roleplaying game, and time and commitments worked out so that we both ended up in the same group playing this game. we got to chatting outside the game when i'd mentioned something about my ex husband, who i still lived with at the time despite being divorced. my now-husband was confused about my living situation, so he asked me a few questions, we started chatting more and ended up playing in another game together. at the time i was single, but not really looking. and i'd told myself i wasn't going to do a long-distance relationship again (my first marriage had started long-distance as well), and in chatting about this, my now-husband joked and said ""i'm going to make you love me."" it went on for a few months after that, and in early 2014 we had a long chat by email and through skype, a lot of back and forth and eventually decided that okay, yeah, we'd try this thing. he was in the uk, i was in australia. i went to the uk for the first time ever to visit him at the end of 2015. i went back again at the end of 2016 and in january 2017 he asked me to marry him. that was also the weekend my ex husband died, so it was a very happy moment followed by several of the most traumatic weeks of my life. but my partner was so supportive and caring through the whole thing, i knew i'd made the right decision. i'd already sold my house in australia back at the beginning of 2016, and unfortunately shortly after my ex passed away, our dog also died. so there was very little tying me back to my home country. we prepared all the documents and requirements for planning a wedding and a fiancee visa for the uk, and in august 2018 my visa was granted. i quit my job of 10 years, got on a plane and arrived in the uk in september 2018. we were married in october, and my temporary residence was approved in january 2019. we've been living together since september. things aren't always perfect, but i'm happier than i'd been in a very long time. he's a very sweet man, i adore him to the ends of the earth, and i'm so happy that i get to spend (hopefully!) the rest of my life with him."	5901	28060	bqltzq	eo5tjuu
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had just moved to nz and the auckland sub was having semi regular meet ups. i decided to go and meet some new people. my partner was a local but had broken up with his girlfriend a few months prior and decided to go to the meet up for similar reasons. we made a good group of friends and ended up at a few outings together and started flirting. we started dating a couple months before my visa was up but could tell this had potential to be something special. we decided to move in together so that i would be eligible for a partnership visa and stay in the county. it made the relationship move pretty fast, but 5+ years later, were married, bought a house in auckland (a huge feat these days!), have a lovely 2 year old pupper, and just welcomed our baby girl into the world in march. we are so in love and have a wonderful, happy life together. all thanks to r/auckland having some meet ups at the local pub.	4301	28060	bqltzq	eo62m77

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i moved to another country to be an au pair after college and didnt know anyone who had ever been there. a boy in the city i was moving to asked if any americans wanted to get coffee or beer so he could practice his english. he shared his twitter profile so he seemed normal. i also read about how hard it was to make friends in norway so i was all over the idea of my first possible friend. he gave me a lot of good advice before i moved. he studied in the us as a college student so had some good points of help. three weeks after i moved he invited me to a party, i got pretty wasted, and he let me sleep in his bed while he slept on the couch. a month later we were dating and six months later we were engaged. a year later he moved to the us and a week after that we got married. now, four years later, we have a cute puppy with a heart shaped nose and we will go back to norway for his 30th this summer. i only started using reddit to ask questions before i moved to another country but since it brought me to meet my person i figured its worth sticking around on. major shoutout to r/norway *edit: meet bandit here: https://imgur.com/d2zoavb	1208	28060	bqltzq	eo61mnc

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"never on reddit, though i'd consider there are a couple of people i've interacted with on here enough that i actually care about them. i met one girl on a message board a long time ago though. not like, ""met a girl and wanted to bang"" but someone who liked the same bands as me and was actually interesting to talk to. i've been talking to her for 25 years and never met her. she knows all about my life, family, ups / downs etc - and i about hers. i'd say it's a truly pure and amazing friendship. outside my immediate family the most important to me. she literally is a best friend who doesn't really judge and actually cannot judge, and i know i truly care about and cares about me. it's one of my few constants in this world."	2387	28060	bqltzq	eo5r5qs
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on a writing subreddit. started talking, and talking turned into getting to know each other. i wasnt 100% sure i wanted to really start a relationship, and i honestly tried to end things and just walk away, but he sent me a really sweet, heartfelt message (on valentines, of all days) and i realized, huh, maybe this guy does like me, and hes actually been paying attention/learning about me. fast forward 2 months, and after weeks of asking, i tell him he can take me out on a date. he drives 7 hours to come see me. god, we were both so nervous. he could barely talk and i couldnt shut up. he kissed me in the parking lot (my first kiss!) and spent the weekend with me. that was over 2 years ago- weve been living together nearly a year, have 2 fur babies, and im more in love with him now than ever. hes the best choice i ever made. best little orange envelope ever. 	2345	28060	bqltzq	eo5yv5z
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	**edit:** sorry if this reads kind of funny i'm using voice to text. we met on the organic chemistry subreddit i used to post there a lot when i was a tutor and help people work through problems and reaction mechanisms. she asked me a lot of really good questions and i enjoyed it explaining them to her. her curriculum was relatively hard for being in o-chem i, so i asked which school she went to. turns out we went to the same school and figured it would be easier to meet in person for tutoring. instantly knew i really liked her she was smart funny loved to workout and had huge ambitions. i told her as soon as i knew my feelings about her and she replied in a text saying i really like you too. but that was it she didn't say anything else which really confuse me. after like four or five hours of neither person saying anything i texted her saying so do you like me enough to date me? she said that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend but that she liked me more then just a friend. after telling her that i liked her i stopped charging her for our tutoring session and just did it because i enjoyed teaching her and the conversations that we would have throughout. after about four months towards the end of the semester she finally told me that she thought she really liked me too and wanted to give this relationship thing a chance. it's been an amazing 3 years and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with his girl. **edit:** also, before people start making puns. yes, i know we have chemistry.	1671	28060	bqltzq	eo5qti7

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was a high school graduate and extremely bored so i decided to stay up all night and get donuts at stupid early in the morning. i really wanted someone to talk to to keep me awake, so i browsed r/r4r for people around my age (let's be honest, i was looking for guys around my age lol). i messaged a handful of people and talked to the first ones who messaged back. there were about 3, one guy i talked to all night until i realized he was a frat boy douche, and 2 others who didn't really interest me because we didn't have the same, well, interests. i ended up messaging one of them back anyway, since i still had a couple hours to kill. he lived in pa and i lived in co. we got along just fine, but i still wasn't very interested. he asked if we could skype later that day, and i almost completely blew him off again. but i decided to give him a chance, and we skyped while playing minecraft together later that night. we had a blast and we talked for hours and hours and hours for several days. after a week or so, he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes. we met in person a couple months later and clicked instantly. we would visit each other a couple times a year until about 2 1/2 years ago, when we finally moved in together! our 5 year anniversary is in about a week. :)	716	28060	bqltzq	eo614nf

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"met on a subreddit's discord server during a strange time in my life. we and a few others branched off into our own group, played video games together and some nights there'd just be three of us sat up late at night talking about anything. sometimes the other guy went to bed, other times we all went off at the same time. i fell for this guy on his voice and personality at first - as odd as that sounds, he was such a *nice* person to be around and talk to, and he had a nice voice. when he sent me a photo of himself he was also very much my type. a short while later, i get tired of dropping hints hoping he'd ask me or initiate the ""romance talk"", so i took the bull by the horns and told him how i felt. he admitted he'd never actually considered an ldr, took a few days to process and then he got back to me and admitted i'd been on his mind a lot and he felt he was starting to feel the same way about me. we've been together for nearly two years now, in an ldr that's about 400 miles apart. we're closing the distance in less than 7 weeks time now, though. i can't wait :)"	246	28060	bqltzq	eo60hfj

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	wasnt on reddit, but i had a friend i met on myspace around 2005, and we kept in touch for a decade or so, sharing band recommendations and chatting. since we lived across the country from each other, neither of us sought any kind of relationship with the other. we tried to meet whenever one of us would be in or around the others neck of the woods, but it just never happened. i was diagnosed with cancer about five years ago, and he determined that he had to do whatever it took to meet me before it was too late. my mom and i were vacationing a few states away, and he drove several hours to hang out. we all had a great time and it was hard for us to say goodbye, especially after the short visit wed planned ended up extending all the way into the next morning (with encouragement from mom and even our airbnb host). we planned a longer visit after i flew home, and spent a wonderful ten days together, after which he asked if i wanted to be in a relationship with him. i declined because i was afraid that, if my cancer killed me in a few years, he wouldve wasted his time when he couldve been with someone in better health. my ex felt that i shouldve been grateful he stuck around after my diagnosis, so i wanted to spare anyone else the burden of being with me. to my surprise, this wonderful man insisted he wanted to be with me no matter what challenges lay ahead. weve been together almost three years, and not once has he made me feel unworthy or unloved despite all my flaws (hair loss, surgery scars, er visits, and other fun problems caused by the cancer or medication). we got married last december and im currently in the process of selling my place and moving to the new house he bought for us. we may have met on myspace, but reddit is one of the main things we bond over now.	26	28060	bqltzq	eo6e23l
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my boyfriend on a video game subreddit looking for people to play with. i made a post and got a solid handful of replies but for some reason, his was the only one i responded to. we ended up playing and talking that night and it didn't stop until the early morning. it felt so easy and so. right. i never vibed with someone like that before. i felt like he was my other half. in fact, he (thankfully) felt the same way and we've been dating ever since! it's been 1.5 years and i'm still just as giddy over him as that first night. i've never been happier. i love him so much. 	47	28060	bqltzq	eo60la6
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"i'm a subscriber to /r/c25k, despite not ever completing the couch-to-5k program or running on a consistent basis. it's a pretty small sub, and most posts are post-run selfies, i like to see people try to better themselves and i'd like to think i'll complete the program someday. one day on that sub i saw a before and after pic of this guy who lost almost 100 lbs. the comments were full of op answering people's questions and giving really kind, thoughtful advice - and honestly, i thought he was really cute. in a few comments he also mentioned striking out on okcupid, so i thought ""fuck it"" and sent him a message with a link to my okcupid profile. turns out he was super interested, and a few weeks later his favorite band happened to be playing a show in my city and he flew out from texas to california to see them and meet me. we hit it off amazingly and were long distance for about a year - 2000 miles away from each other. three weeks ago he moved to california to be with me. i couldn't be happier or more in love, i honestly thought love like this was a myth before i met him. we both talk all the time about how lucky we are to have found each other. /u/trenta_is_not_enough i love you!"	23	28060	bqltzq	eo69887
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met someone on r4r that i dated for a few months. we have since broken up, but it was nice while it lasted. i talked to a lot of interesting people on r4r. it's kind of a bummer when the conversation just fades away though.	67	28060	bqltzq	eo5ssvc

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i started playing a video game called digital paintball 2 around 2006 (i was around 12/13) and happened to play and team with mainly people in na (am eu), which lead to several years of awkwardly timed gaming sessions. met a group on that game i got on with very well, and eventually (in 2010ish) one of their girlfriends. theyd ask me if i had any plans to be in their cities or states at some point, as we became very good friends playing games for so many years. i told the couple id come to their wedding if they ever got married, which at the time they kinda brushed off. &#x200b; a few months ago they told me about their engagement and told me theyd love it if i could come. so, im all booked to go to their wedding in boston in july. its wild, i played games with and just generally spent a huge amount of time with these people, and now i finally get to keep my promise and see these two people i have a great deal of love for get married. they invited me to their pre and post wedding family celebrations, so im super excited to share in their special time.	21	28060	bqltzq	eo659pp

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	the simple story: we were both in relationships with other people who were absolutely horrible. i made a post on an r4r subreddit specifically looking for a hookup. his genuineness was just so tangible in his message and we were in the same (ethically non-monogamous, the fact that we were with shitty people became apparent later) situation that i felt drawn to him right away. this was strange for me because i was also posting on other subreddits (r/gonewild[fill in the blank], which i met my ex on)that had me interacting with tons of guys on the daily due to the explicit stuff i was posting. so i was desensitized and kinda disillusioned by guys pickup lines (even the ones that seemed polite and nice) we meet. we hookup. i stay the night, mostly because we lost track of time and connected right away. were *very* different people but also extremely the same. we get breakfast the next day. i go home and think about him the entire week. the next week he breaks up with his girlfriend. the week after that, i break up with my boyfriend. we dont have a talk about being official right away because it just doesnt seem important. he says i love you very soon and i say it back because i feel it and i mean it. two months later, and i had drawers of things at his place. a little more time and we meet each others families. we just got married today.	17	28060	bqltzq	eo6h6qz
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was drunk one night and decided to look up the subreddit asainladyboners i scrolled down and the third picture caught my eye. this super attractive dude with a black suit on and long hair made my jaw drop. i had to send him a message even though i knew i would never hear back he was way out of my league. not only did he message back but weve been dating for almost a year and he treats me like a queen. im so lucky.	60	28060	bqltzq	eo65bhx
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	well my story may be the weirdest one among all these. i was going through a phase where i was hitting the gym very often and getting some really good results, combine this the fact that i have a small ego that needs confirmation through posting pics of myself online.eventually i am posting myself to the r/guysgonewild sub with full body showing but nothing too explicit (genitals are covered). next thing i know i am on the front page of the sub and an inbox full of messages from females and males alike (50-50 ratio), a lot of them just wanted to sext and as a straight male i obliged and had some fun with the girls over snapchat or what have you. however i should note that i never respond to these messages asking for sexts or anything, i simply have genuine conversations with most of them and it ends in sexting in most cases. one girl however never got to the point of asking me for sexual favors and instead we spoke a lot about the meaning of life and how crazy this reality of a universe we live in is, we even got into deeper quantum mechanics than i have with any other person before. i was very much falling for her and she reciprocated the same feelings for me, we exchanged numbers and ended up texting each other daily and eventually calling each other every night for months. a year or so later i move out of my parents place and decided to rent an apartment with her. today we are still together going on 2 years soon and feel like we are each others soul mates lol	70	28060	bqltzq	eo69q2h
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met playing with the same guild in everquest. played together as friends for somewhere around 3 years with the guild and in groups. a handful of us met for a weekend and just hung out. my guy and i end up really clicking. a little later a bunch of us decided to meet irl, so we planned this big guild meeting in vegas. there were like 30 or so of us. he and i both stayed an extra day and walked around, talked, just enjoyed each other's company. after that we were seldom apart for more than a few days. he moved to my state,i moved to the city he moved to. we've been together just short of 20 years now, and 4 kids(2 from a previous marriage)are still crazy in love and i couldn't imagine anyone more perfect for me and our kids.	14	28060	bqltzq	eo65en4

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	met my so on /r/r4r. i was looking to meet a girl and my so responded. she was local which was pretty cool and we sent long messages back and forth for a few days. i had not been having great experiences with my dates from okcupid and she mentioned she had some bad experiences dating too and she was just really looking for friends. i was kind of tired of the whole dating thing myself (it's super exuasting mentally and emotionally) so the just friends thing sounded pretty good to me. we started hanging out pretty regularly pretty soon after we met up. her best friend came along a lot too. we had a bunch of fun and where hanging out several times a week (which is a lot when you're a full time college student with a job and they live 50 minutes away). after about 3 or 4 months of casually hanging out we decided to go take a trip to a place 4 hours outside the city to go try out astrophotography. we did it twice within 2 weeks for a total of 16 hours of driving so we got to just talk a lot. we opened up with each other and shared a lot of personal stuff during the drives and really got to know each other on a more real level. i just remember on the way back from one of the trips after conversation had died down just sitting there and thinking how awesome she was and how much i liked her. about 2 or 3 weeks later we ended up officially dating and have been going strong for almost 3 years now. come to find out she was thinking the same thing during our star gazing trip. it was the moment we both knew we wanted each other. i just moved states for a job this weekend and she put in her 2 weeks notice last week and will be joining me in my new apartment very soon :).	11	28060	bqltzq	eo6c8la
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"a few years ago i was a moderator for a national subreddit. a most excellent dude (hi /u/jorgander ) posted a message saying ""i will be visiting your beautiful country later this year, do you guys want anything from the states?"" people made their requests, and some time later, the most excellent dude posts again, saying ""ok, i had a great time here, i am leaving today, and i want to drop off all the goodies you guys asked for."" the girlfriend of another mod and myself went there, let the most excellent dude know he was, in fact, a most excellent dude, picked up the loot (a huge bag, nearly broke my skinny back carrying it), divvied it up (we have a saying, he who shares gets a bigger share), and then i set up a meet to get everybody their stuff. as the meet began, it was the sausage party you'd expect from a reddit meet, and then *she* walks in. she had red hair and wore a star trek shirt. those were the first things i noticed about her. she noticed my dr who t-shirt. more people show up, beer is drunk, shit is shot, good times are had by all. the girl tells me she has to go, and i, despite being in a drunken stupor, go ""well it's raining, i have an umbrella, i'll walk you to a cab."" on the way to the cab, i tell her ""okay, gonna need to kiss you like, right now."" she goes ""damn, i've been dropping hints all evening."" lol wat. i haven't trained for this. anyway, that was seven years ago yesterday. two years ago today we were in church saying ""i do"", and today she's making french toast for the kid. that reddit meet led directly to the best days of my life."	12	28060	bqltzq	eo759kn

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my bf of 5+ years on reddit through r/gonewild. i posted naughty pics (on a throw away account, so don't bother trying to scroll back in my post history, you'll be disappointed because its mostly animal crossing and pics of succulents) and he responded being funny and nice instead of ~~with a dick pic~~ sleazy/gross/objectifying. i replied back, and we chatted all night, learned we lived about an hour away from each other, eventually shared face pictures. in the morning i sent a video to his kik or whatsapp or whatever was the texting app of choice at the time saying my name, his name, and some specific detail we mentioned the night before to prove i wasn't a catfish. after two weeks of texting, we met up in person and have been dating ever since. moved in together two years ago. we had a friend who worked at reddit hq for a while, and he mentioned this story to alexis ohanian at some point, which he loved. we met him at a talk he did a while ago and asked if he would officiate our wedding and he agreed depending on his availability. i told him we're not engaged yet so our calendar is pretty flexible haha	39	28060	bqltzq	eo65ap9

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met a guy on reddit that was looking for someone to play games with. we played some games and got along so we kept playing and chatting here and there. he always seemed a little off but it didn't affect anything as far as what we were doing so it was whatever. well one day we get to talking about our pets somehow and he just starts casually talking about how he adopts cats and if they aren't good enough for him he kills them for fun, survival of the fittest and all that. i told him he was fucked up and haven't talked to him since.	9	28060	bqltzq	eo63f25
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	almost a year ago i was in one of the darkest depressions of my life. i told the guy i was sort of dating at the time (he never called me his girlfriend because he wasnt ready) i was thinking pretty seriously about killing myself. i wasnt trying to play him for sympathy, but i was very afraid and never had such obsessive thoughts about it before. he was worried for maybe a day, then blew it off. one night i felt particularly low, and for the first time ever looked for someone online. i went through dozens of posts on a sub for people meeting each other and chatting using the app kik. i chose the one i felt was the most sincere, albeit a little sad, downloaded the app, and sent that person a message. 258 days later, that guy who didnt care about me has dumped me twice, and ive cut him out of my life. this stranger i met on reddit and started chatting with on kik is my whole support system. we talk everyday and all night. last week he flew across the country to meet me and my cats, and we had a blast together. when im sad, he always knows just what to say and i am no longer in that dark frightening pit. were there for each other. im there when he is sad too. we plays lots of games together, and now weve even done that in person! he reads to me sometimes (because hes very eloquent) and i can tell him all my secret. he likes to watch me draw sometimes when i work up the courage to do so. now i can say i have a boyfriend who loves me!	10	28060	bqltzq	eo66h9h
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i had a really terrible 2012 and in january 2013 thought fuck it, let's try online dating. tried match.com, eharmony, all of the basics. kept hitting steep paywalls or questionnaires that were unnecessary and uncomfortable. so i said fuck it, reddit's got to have an answer to this. and i found /r/r4r . i typed a quick post, exchanged messages with a lot of really weird people, and one stuck out. messaging on reddit turned into texting turned into skype turned into him driving 16 hours to northern minnesota in the dead of winter so we could meet. met on reddit in january, in person in march, i moved to him in september and we married in october. he is amazing. i don't want to embarrass him so i can't brag too much but i have an incredible husband and we have a great life together.	9	28060	bqltzq	eo66ji5
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	in december 2011, i got out of a. sub-optimal relationship, and i was looking for a new adventure. i posted on /r/idliketobeatree, a smallish community i'd found refuge in, saying i was taking a road trip from wichita to nyc, and that i'd like to meet up with people from the sub along the way. one person responded, and we met just outside of st. louis, mo. he was a mod of the subreddit, and we skyped a few times beforehand, so i found myself trusting him. found out he was moving to a town in kansas only a half hour away from me, and barely a month later we started a beautiful relationship, the best five years i've ever known. he showed me what it means to be truly good and kind. i'm so grateful i took a chance on a random sub.	8	28060	bqltzq	eo6r1h3

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we didn't exactly meet on reddit but i have gotten her on reddit now! we met on a site called emerald chat, she thought i was this young girl because of my personality. but our talk on the website was great, added each other in there, talked more. now we exchanged skypes and within 1 week of having each other on skype i told her that i loved her because i didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell my feelings for her, especially when you don't know what the next day entails for such a distance. i'm in the us and she's in malaysia so the time difference was massive and she's busy with university. we've had our ups and downs but we keep pushing through it. a year in i had the weird idea of giving her a middle name as malay's typically don't have middle names. so we went through some names and picked out one she likes, and she's absolutely in love with it now. the way she smiles when i refer to her as that name just makes my heart tick faster. i fall asleep in calls with her all the time and she puts up with it and finds it calming just watching me sleep, hell. before we were dating we fell asleep together in a voice call on skype. i can't say i regret because i don't. i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her. thanks for putting up with the flow of my short story. i know it's a bit chaotic.	7	28060	bqltzq	eo69mgt

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i was going to a university far away and posted on reddit about the hall i would be staying in. someone commented they were also staying in that hall. we chatted for a bit and then said we would see each other there. 4 months later after completely forgetting about this interaction i started dating this girl and about 2 weeks in she was talking about someone she has been trying to find in our hall who she talked to on reddit a few months ago. i connected the dots, brought up my comment history and asked her if that was her. so turns out, out of all 300 people i could have got with, i chose the one that i chatted to on a unanynous website without even knowing.	7	28060	bqltzq	eo6ay8x

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	"dec 2017, i moved in a new city, a university town in the middle of proverbial nowhere. it's a small city by my standards (population of 300k here vs the 5m tourist city where i just was vs the 13m capital city where i grew up). i don't speak the local language(s), the pocket community that does speak english are families and religious people, and had a hard time looking for my own crowd. i saw a thread talking about the city, someone said that ""so-and-so city is dank"" and i jumped ""where is the dankness,"" because the city is nothing but bars and sand and bars and more sand and sometimes camels (it's in the edge of the desert). before i arrived, i also made a similar post in the same sub before about what to do in the city. this guy pops in and suggests places to go to, then he messages me if we could hang out sometime. i've hung out with people from reddit before, they were mostly cool, so i was like, sure. he didn't know i was a girl. been dating ever since, moved in october last year, and he's a sweet, wonderful man who's probably reading this post in a few hours because we openly stalk each other's reddit profiles. ^^^^hey. ^^^^get ^^^^to ^^^^work."	7	28060	bqltzq	eo77yf4

people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	6 months ago, i went on a date with a girl i met on a dating app. she tells me that i remind her of one of her friends. she tells me that this friend is armenian, like me. she tells me her friend is into classic cars, like me. she sent me a photo of this beautiful 1967 chevy impala that belonged to her friend. she tells me ive got the same sense of humor as her friend. heck, she says if we dont work out, maybe ill set you up with her!. long story short, we didnt work out. one day, weeks after that date, im scrolling through r/classiccars. low and behold i see a photo of this gorgeous blue 1967 impala get posted. something about the photo sticks with me. it hits me that this is the exact same photo the girl sent me. im thinking no way! this has to be her armenian friend. i take a chance and send a pm to her. i was right, it was the same person i thought it was. she sent me her number to talk cars, and talk we did! turns out we have almost everything in common. we made each other laugh like crazy. we have the same sense of humor. were both artists in our own way. we both love classic muscle cars. we both love 90s music. we both basically have the same train of thought. she used to work at the company i work at now. were both in tech. we both struggled with past relationships. we send each other the exact same gifs at the same time. her weird is my kinda weird. we also both have insanely bushy armenian eyebrows (but she takes care of hers). we went on a date and within an hour, we were saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. seriously, at least once a day we say the same thing at the same time. weve been together ever since. i found my soul mate on reddit. i found my life partner. i found someone i never knew could be so incredible (and real) on reddit. so thank you reddit! and more importantly thank you u/youllregreddit for responding to a spontaneous, weird, anonymous message on reddit 6 months ago, and i cant wait for the rest of our lifetimes together!	6	28060	bqltzq	eo68i8a

(well, it was sunday 17th may 2015) i posted in our local sub in the april about a meetup and we ended up doing our own instead. 4 years later, we are amazingly happy. he lives with me and we just had a lovely day today with our blended family - my daughter, his son, his mum, and the two of us all sat outside in the garden having tea. we are so happy and grateful to reddit for bringing us together.	5	28060	bqltzq	eo697y9
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	i met my now husband on r/loseit in 2012. i was in the chat talking to everyone and happened to mention i was australian. husband said he loved utes and was obsesssed with holden cars. we struck up a friendship and spoke almost every day for years. i moved instate and the communication kinda died off. i was so upset by it but life was crazy for me and i was isolated from family and friends. in 2016 our communication started up again and i realised that what i had been feeling was more than just friendly feelings towards him. but how would it work? he was in florida and i was in australia. it seemed impossible. one night, we were having a deep and meaningful conversation and he told me he had feelings for me. i was so happy! i told him i absolutely felt the same and we decided we would do whatever it took to make this work. i met him in person in march 2017 when i flew over and spent a month with him. we were exactly the same in person as we were on skype/chat. he came to australia last year for two weeks and i got to show him the now closed holden factory and he got to hold a koala and feed kangaroos. it was so much fun. in july he proposed to me via video chat (which was perfect for my introverted self) and of course i said yes. we were married when i flew there for xmas last year and have now filed for the cr1 visa. the 16 month wait until we close the gap as begun!!!	6	28060	bqltzq	eo69hc9
people who met their so or another important person in their life through reddit, whats your story?	we met on /r/ohior4r. no lie, i was cruising for booty, she was looking for a hookup and casual dating. she made a post, i noticed it about a week after she posted but i figured i would try anyways. i pmed her and asked if she was still looking, she wrote back about an hour later saying she was. we got to texting, things got flirty, we exchanged some pictures and decided wed go out to dinner that night. dinner was great, full of great conversation. then we get done and i walk her to her car. we starting making out pretty hard and then she says, i guess i can take you home. we get to her place and instantly get into some hot and heavy sex. we ended up having sex four times that night, and we kept it up for the next month. after a month of wild sex and hanging out, we found out we had a ton of things in common. we started officially dating in may of 2015, and were still together now. in fact im going to propose to her this year.	6	28060	bqltzq	eo6aedx
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my high school gf worked there way back in the day. she said the worst part of the day was having to collect merchandise from the fitting rooms and cleaning the fitting rooms. apparently, all sorts of nasty women would go in there and try on the panties, not use a liner and just generally leave them all crusty and bad smelling. they would also leave pads and tampons all over. she said they had to throw away so much merchandise that was left in that condition. i feel like this may be a problem anywhere they sell clothes but then again hot topic may attract a different type of customer so it might have happened more often?	2313	30729	blna2q	emqmxqo
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at a hot topic in '99-'00. we used to get a fair amount of strippers that came in because we were the only place around that sold see-through vinyl bikini tops and 6 inch stack boots and shit like that. anyway, our fitting room was basically a hole cut in a wall with a mirror and a thick curtain that had to be pulled close just right. this one day, a stripper came in to try on a bunch of stuff and really didn't even bother with the curtain. apparently, she was so used to people seeing her naked that it wasn't a big deal for her. granted, this was a weekday morning and she and her boyfriend/manager/bodyguard or whatever were the only people in the store besides my manager and me. at one point she just stopped using the fitting room altogether and was just using the full length mirror on the door to the stockroom/office. my manager and i really had no idea what to do, because at this point she's got about $1500-$2000 worth of merchandise that she's probably buying, and this lady is good for both business *and* morale. she didn't seem to be worried at the prospect of anyone seeing her, and the way our store was set up was really narrow and long, and the display fixtures were tall and bulky. it was very difficult to see into and out of the store unless you were standing in the center aisle. it made loss prevention a nightmare, but really allowed this lady to let her freak flag fly. she finally puts her clothes on at the cash wrap as she's checking out. my manager gave me so much shit after that because i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact with the customer while i rang her up. that was the largest transaction i ever rang up in my time there, and paid for it with the largest wad of cash i'd ever seen in my life up to that point. **tl;dr a stripper came in on a slow day and treated the store like her own private dressing room.**	773	30729	blna2q	emqtabw
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked at hot topic about 8 years ago. for the most part, the gig was the best part-time job i ever had. great managers, great coworkers, great customers. only 2 instances stand out in my mind. 1. this was around when twilight was big. middle-aged women would come in and ask where the edward/jacob merch was and then just start fawning over them in the most uncomfortable way. 2. my actual interview. it was a group interview. one of the questions was something about either a difficult customer service moment or something. this one guy (obvious ht scene type) proudly talks about the time he worked at a bookstore and sucker-punched a female customer in the face for calling his style weird/freaky/something. i never saw that guy again so i dont think he got the job.	1935	30729	blna2q	emqsb8s
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"i worked for 2 years at my local hot topic and the worst stories both involved the fitting room. our fitting room used to be a self-service room in the back of the store with a red curtain in front of it. an employee noticed 4 feet in the room and opened it to find two people having sex in it and had to clean up the remnants. a second incident came when a smell wafted from the same room. it was later discovered that someone had actually taken a dump in the room when they went in to ""try on clothes"". we ended up fitted the room with a galvanized piece of chain and a masterlock to keep the curtain open. luckily, shortly thereafter, we got a full store overhaul that put in actual fitting rooms."	5258	30729	blna2q	emqlur6
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my current boss was a former store manager at a hot topic and he told me that he caught one of his employees stealing a shirt he had stuffed into a sonic cup. from then on out everyone had to check bags and beverages for merchandise.	6258	30729	blna2q	emqlm8l
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	a petite friend is currently a manager at one and her issue is always a customer that become too-often repeat customer obsessed with her or another female employee. currently it's a guy that swears they would have everything in common because he likes all the things in the store too, as if she curated it, and now has to stay 500 feet from the store.	6705	30729	blna2q	emqn6an
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a horror story but a ridiculous short one. i had a woman come in with her sleeping infant and screamed at me to turn off the music while she strolled around the store. i mean if your baby is sleeping and you want them to continue, maybe dont come to browse the store that you can hear music blasting from the other side of the mall, idk what to tell ya haha.	11265	30729	blna2q	emqmbsn
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	thursday is actually my last day with hot topic after 4 years! in general the company is amazing to its employees and ive met some incredible people. but boy do i have stories!! 1. i once found a condom on our anime section. it was open and filled with.something. 2. we had a girl who i am positive had some mental issue because she would get into the fitting room and try to lure anyone in there to help her then try and seduce them. she was actually pretty but young and filled to the brim with crazy. 3. alice cooper came into the store once. totally unannounced and brought a teacup pig. absolutely wonderful person. gave our metalhead associate tickets to his show and this dude about lost it. 4. also met machine gun kelly, mayday parade, we the kings, and max green of escape the fate. mgk and the vocalist for wtk were assholes. 5. we had a guy get thrown against the front gate on the morning of a funko pop release. in general the job has taught me some pop collectors are grads a assholes. 6. had a woman ask me if she should go back to stripping after her c section, then lifted her shirt to show me the scar and her tits. 7. we found out there was a group of mallrats who wrote fan fiction about the staff at our store. i never got to see any and im glad for that.	1044	30729	blna2q	emqt8cz
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was working on the sales floor and this guyat least in his 30s and pretty highstarts making sexual comments to me about this 15ish girl that was checking out. i asked him to leave and nothing more came of it but ich it was chilling. also had a co-worker get fired because they were selling weed out of the back room. shed sneak it into their bag while they were checking out. also had a different, off-duty, co-worker come in hammered late one night to tell everyone working how great we were. that was actually kinda nice. besides that, it was a lot of kicking out vaping teenagers and letting the quiet girls from my school try on skimpy harley quinn bikinis in the dressing room. edit:grammar	2594	30729	blna2q	emqofea
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked there for 13 years. soooo much weird, but that's just retail in general. caught a guy masturbating into women's shoes in the dressing room. people had sex in there more often than you'd be comfortable with. i worked for them when columbine happened. we carried a brand of clothing back then called serial killer, which featured pop culture pics/references and some edgy saying, like a pic of bruce lee that said ""revenge"" or something like that. the morning after columbine happened, we got an email to pull all the serial killer clothing line off the sales floor, as well as every trenchcoat in the store. by the end of the day i'd already had to call security twice due to people showing up at the store and harassing me for 'supporting those psychos' and 'training the next ones'. then the tv networks showed up and pretty much camped the front of our store, harassing every customer as they walked in/out, asking them why this 'dark lifestyle' attracted them. the mall ended up having security just hang out in front of our store and walking our employees to their cars for a week afterward. honestly, it was the best job i ever had. the company was really supportive at the corporate level. i still have friends that work there. they pretty much left me alone so long as i made sales, so i had carte blanche to set up my stores the way i wanted even if it didn't look like the planned merchandising setups they sent out. i had direct access with every dept, so if i felt my stores couldn't sell something they sent us, they'd let me transfer it somewhere else, and vice versa, get more best sellers in. honestly, if it wasn't for the working every weekend and closing a lot stuff, i would have continued working there."	15062	30729	blna2q	emql2r3
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee. i worked a whole 3 months in summer, so all the kids were out and about. i was stocking disney merchandise and i couldn't help but notice a kid underneath one of our clearance racks. i heard some strange noise coming from there too so i crouch under and look at the kid. he had a button, needle and all, in his mouth. i asked him where his parents were and before i knew it he swallowed the pin and ran out of the store. i couldn't leave and go search for the child so i let security know about the button kid. never knew what happened after that. i can't seem to forget button kid though.	4211	30729	blna2q	emqku1l
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"spent almost 5 years working at one in the early 2000's. being in the midwest, we had a ton of juggalos but they were actually pretty nice people in general. i had a group of kids ask what i would do if they ""set some clothes on fire"" and flicked a lighter multiple times. we mostly got weirdos who wanted to bang in the dressing room or lifted up their shirts to ask me what gauge their nipple ring is. we had this one girl who came in weekly and i dont think she was all there. she would sit at the listening station for way too long and then leave. one day she sat down and put the headphones on. she had a plastic bag with her filled with empty glass bottles and peaches (yes, the fruit). we noticed it was leaking onto the floor but just let her do her thing. she put the headphones back and looked at her leaking bag. she had a mildly disappointed look on her face but immediately looked at her watch and yelled ""i'm going to miss my bus!"". she ran out of the store and up to a trash can outside the store. she held the bag up high and yelled ""peaches meet your fate!!!"", threw the bag in the trash, and sprinted off. that job was weird."	5353	30729	blna2q	emqprnc
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	former employee of a couple years in high school. i loved that job. the biggest horror story that sticks out in my mind was this guy that would always come in with his kids. he was a huge icp fan, and from the looks of it, he let his kids (both boys, they were i'd guess maybe 7 and 8 at the time) listen as well. they always had hatchet man stuff on and pretty bitchin' haircuts. they always misbehaved, just running around the store screaming, sometimes crashing into stuff, and the dad gave no fucks. he was often pretty rude to us in the store about not having specific merch or being out of stuff in his size (he was a large guy.) i had and still have no business in what that guy does with his kids, but i always felt a little bad that there was a good chance they would end up in a bad way. other than that reoccurring instance, for the most part our store was really fun.	5277	30729	blna2q	emqfs4l
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i worked for hot topic for about 7 years. my store was apparently the juggalo store of the district, and i think the state. working for that company as long as i did, i was pretty used to ignoring people's crappy taste, but the juggalos were different. this is in central florida, so it's on average about 90 degrees most days and always humid as hell. these kids were always very overweight, wearing a massive black icp tee, those ridiculous 30 pound black tripp pants with huge pockets and all the hardware (chains and straps) hanging from them, and they were drenched in sweat (their hygiene was almost always awful). they always seemed to show whenever a new icp shirt or collectible would arrive, and would smell up the store and pay in wadded up, sweat soaked money. it was just all around unpleasant. the smell would linger for a bit after they left. it was not pleasant.	6882	30729	blna2q	emqjxie

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this is my time to shine. i was helping a lady at the disney section. she was pretty particular about the things she wanted and was asking if they looked okay enough for her. being my first job i was really enthusiastic about being a sales person and i really do love disney. so i was hyping her up the best i could and were laughing together, getting along really well. then she says, yeah i wanted to get all the same things my boyfriends baby mama has, is that weird? literally did not know how to respond. i said it wasnt and cashed her out quick.	13148	30729	blna2q	emqif06
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	this was my first job in my college town, and generally, i absolutely loved it. youre treated like some super cool mini-celebrity by all the little mall rats, the management was generally great to their employees, and the work wasnt too hard in my small, low volume store. however, there was the issue of valentines day. that year they were promoting all these different corsets and lingerie, as well as the get in our pants campaign for the skinny jeans. management wanted the employees to try and show the corsets not just as lingerie, but as fashion items, maybe paired with the skinny jeans. increase sales and all. so there i am, valentines day, in a black corset and tight black skinny jeans and boots. waaay more sexy than 18-year old me with a still-developing body was comfortable with. in comes creepy mccreeper, a 50+ something dude who says he wants to buy something for his wife, but wants some help picking it out. not once did his eyes look at my face. the entire time im helping him, hes staring at my ass or chest and making weird comments about how i remind him of his daughter, or being uncomfortably comfortable telling me explicit details about his wifes body. he then asks me to try it on and show him, so he could see how it would look on his wife. luckily, shy 18-year old me awkwardly laughed it off and got him past the register and out of the store. i loved that job but jesus, did it draw some weirdos.	15765	30729	blna2q	emqk09k
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"maybe not so much horror, but just terribly annoying/cringy. 1. i was wearing a hellblazer shirt that had a cover of the new 52 revamp on it. i had two neckbeards come up and start trying to gatekeep me on if i was ""really"" a fan of hellblazer/john constantine. it included the actual questions of ""well, what's your favorite arc?"" ""who is your favorite writer/artist?"" 2. halloween is coming up. it's the halloween season after suicide squad came out, so we have both versions of the joker's outfits (the other from the dark knight). both versions were unreasonably expensive. in total for the dark knight costume, if i remember correctly was about $200 all together. because you had to buy the coat, the undershirt, the pants etc. the fabric of the costume was just a little bit better quality then the $50 version you get at any halloween setup store. we had a guy come in about 30 minutes before we closed for the night and wanted to try on the dark knight version of the joker's outfit. the costume was hanging up on the tallest rack so it required me getting a pole and pulling down each one because the size he needed was a large and each component of the costume. he tried it on, enjoyed it, and wanted to buy it. i went ahead to go ring him up and then when he saw the price of it he started flipping out. he started complaining that he could find this costume in anywhere else that he wanted at a cheaper price. he wanted to know if there's any coupons or if i could give him my employee discount. i told him there's no way i could do that. he starts flipping out and says he needs his costume tomorrow and he doesn't have that money now. he took me about 45 minutes after closing to finally leave. he did not buy the costume. even before suicide squad came out working halloween around hot topic was always cringey with all the joker and harley quinn people. edited to correct minor errors - was using speech to text to tell the story while feeding the baby. sorry!"	5620	30729	blna2q	emqk0wq
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	finally one of these where i have an actual personal story. i worked at one for about a year. you would see a lot of cringy stuff just because of the base it attracts, but nothing terrible horrible usually besides one time. i was working a saturday afternoon shift, it was about 3:30 pm and the store wasnt busy at all. there were only two weaboo looking guys in their 20s in the store. then, a group of four teens walked in giggling and looking suspicious. they go up to the weaboos and start singing the nyan cat song nyannyanyannyanyannyanyanyannyanyanyan!!!! me and my coworker are like what the fuck. one of the weaboos gets aggressive and is like step the fuck back! step the fuck back! he then fucking grabs a chain wallet and starts swinging it at them. i call security and my coworker is just screaming hey hey hey!!! trying to stop it. one of the kids calls the weaboos fat asses as hes still trying to hit them with the wallet, and responds to their insult by calling them daddys cum stain bitch asses. by now 3 security guards come in and break it up, while the silent weaboo is saying the kids started it. both parties are escorted out different exits while we give a report on what happened. never saw any of them again.	10291	30729	blna2q	emqhkvb

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"worked at one seasonally for about 6 years through high school and college. absolutely loved working there. we had a customer come in who claimed he was a vampire. he dressed like an extra from interview with the vampire on a tight budget and went out of his way to insist that he was truly a vampire. he would occasionally corner employees to berate them about this. it happened to me while i was helping him find a new pair of boots. he cornered me by the changing rooms, told me all about the women he enthralls, and spoke in metaphors at me for about 15 minutes. i tried to be as polite as possible and feigned interest, but eventually he must have noticed i wasn't falling prey to his glamor so he switched to complaining about how he has two different sized feet and finding footwear is hard. outside of customers, we once had an absolute idiot as a manager. dude would come in and fall asleep on the tables in the stock room, or spend hours at a time in the bathroom and have us tell anyone looking for him that he's on a conference call. he'd also occasionally try to find ways to get mos'd merch out to his car. once, back when we had a cd changer for the in-store music, he brought in a bunch of cds from his car to play. one was blink-182's take off your pants and jacket. none of the album's he brought in we're censored, which we didn't actually think about until the intro the the bonus track ""fuck a dog"" came on. the store was pretty full, we both panicked, and i ended up jumping over the counter to get to the cd changer in time to hit skip. my toe caught the counter on my way over, throwing me off balance and causing me to drill my other foot toes-first into the floor. still skipped before anyone knew what was playing, though. edit: typo"	170	30729	blna2q	emqsqk7
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	well i worked at the pac sun two stores down but knew the ht people pretty well as they were the only ones who also smoked cigarettes; if either were out of smokes we could get one from the other. hung out with the manager a few times at his place to smoke out etc. he was super into coheed and cambria and we'd jam out to that. had a wife and kid who were super nice and cooked dinner for me when i was there. end up moving and on a trip back home, i stop in to see if anyone i knew was still there. ask about manager dude and the person's face just drops. turns out dude was in prison for fucking a 14yo.	993	30729	blna2q	emqnpku
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"former ht store manager here. at the height of the twilight craze, and when i was still a sales associate, we had a midnight release party for the first movie's dvd. people legitimately camped out in the mall to be at this event. generic twilight fans: 12-16 year old girls, their mothers, and the odd sprinkling of adults that were wildly out of place. employees were encouraged to dress up in twi merch, but me being 17 and engrossed in the suburban punk rock lifestyle, i did not participate. my sm was not pleased about this, so she mos'd (marked out of stock) an outfit for me. girls size small ""i  boys who sparkle"" tee that rode up like a crop top, the tightest jeans i've ever worn, and to top it all off, she aggressively applied eyeliner, sparkly eye shadow, and body glitter all over me. and before anyone asks or makes the whole process into something sexy, she was in her mid forties, overweight, and generally the most unpleasant person ever. it was humiliating, but the only saving grace is that i got so. many. phone. numbers that night. i was drowning in high school girls who thought i was amazing. nothing ever came from it though. i've got other stories, but i'm headed into my adult job now. if i remember, l will post a few more tonight. edit: rip my inbox. also, for clarity's sake, i am a dude."	7843	30729	blna2q	emqgoao
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i didn't work there very long, but i remember on my second day of the job a lady came in looking for something to buy her daughter. told me she was a fan of janis joplin, jimi hendrix, that kind of stuff. so i walked around with her for maybe an hour showing her all sorts of things she might like (this was back when hot topic was more music oriented in the early 2000's). we picked out a few really awesome things i thought she might like.and then the mom spotted a marilyn manson mini skirt. after hearing how her daughter dressed and what kind of music she listened to for upwards of an hour, i tried to tell the mom that her daughter probably wouldn't like that skirt. but she insisted and ended up getting only the skirt. it was my first retail job. something inside me died a little that day.	452	30729	blna2q	emqpuyt
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i was there for 4 years, so ill have to think about this for a bit. first story that comes to mind was my first halloween. corporate sent out calendars that were only on the shelf for maybe 3 hours. each month was a different serial killer. it had a picture, stats and sayings from each one. for instance, one month (june i believe) was ed gein. it had his kill count listed, and then basic bullet point facts about him. this was the first and only time i ever saw corporate had us field destroy merchandise. to this day i wish i had kept a copy. edit: it was 2007. i was only part time and i had only been there a few months. had i known how cool it wouldve been i wouldve taken one. or five. i had planned on buying one the second we unboxed them. thanks for all the likes!	19882	30729	blna2q	emq5wtp

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"i managed 3 different hot topics in the late 90's/early 2000s. mostly i had a great time working there. i don't know that i have any horror stories, per se, but there was a lot of crazy shit that went on. in the main store i worked in, people (including staff) were constantly fucking in the changing room. teenagers would come in reeking of weed so strongly that you could smell them across the store. people were always coming in in bondage gear, on leashes, etc. which was pretty hilarious, because the store i was at was in a really suburban area. there was one guy that came for about a year, every weekend, asking about stiletto boots in a particular size that was really hard to find. finally, i managed to find a pair and got it shipped to our store. turns out they were for him. he was like maybe 5'5"" and 300lbs. probably the most memorable experiences was the time that a bunch of the raver kids (i say kids, i was like 21 at the time) convinced me to go out to a rave with them. the store manager was going (i was assistant), along with like 3 staff. the staffers were over 18, but still living at home, and at the end of they were too high to go home. so the manager (also still rolling) decided we could all just crash in the back of the store, since we had a bunch of bean bag chairs back there. ended up with lots of oral sex being exchanged."	2606	30729	blna2q	emql4om
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	didnt work there but i can bet your butt a hot topic employee cringed and laughed at me. when i was 10ish, i really loved to write. i was also going through that edgy phase (i think avril lavigne was getting big right around then). i was looking around the store, not really knowing what half the stuff was. they always had awesome bumper stickers, and i picked one up that said inkaholic. because i liked to write, you know, with ink. and i told the cashier as much when he asked me what the sticker meant. that was one of those things that i completely forgot about until several years later when it randomly popped in my head, and i realized how wrong i was. i hope he got a good laugh over me.	5737	30729	blna2q	emqe8zu

"not realy a horror story, but too good to not share. &#x200b; i worked at the warehouse and at one point corporate had this great idea that instead of letting clearance merch sit in the stores and take up space that they should ship it back to the warehouse to be clearanced via the website or whatever. the amount of stuff coming back was overwhelming and wound up in those big pallet-sized cardboard bins.at least 50 of them completely full and somewhat sorted. &#x200b; they did a warehouse sale that was open to the public and were selling things at set prices like $1 for a shirt or something like that. the employees got to preshop the sale. i was preshopping it when some other girl that works in the warehouse picks up this shirt with a state on it that she didn't recognize. she said, ""what state is this"". my reply.that's africa."	1528	30729	blna2q	emqkpew

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i didnt work there for a long time bc i was seasonal but lemme say working at ht in a more southern conservative area is.well an experience. we had a huge harry potter sale and management had us dress in house colors the whole nine yards. well the sale was during a weekend so we had a bunch of kids coming in to spend their allowance or whatever on a band tee or chain wallets and pops. one lady came in looked me up and down and told me i needed jesus. i get it i work at ht parents come in all the time and like to tell me how im going to hell for pushing my satanic beliefs on their little angels. she didnt stop though she kept telling me that god would smite me and she hopes i burn in hell. when i tried to defuse the situation and ask why she thought i should go to hell she said what are you ret*rded? harry potter is witchcraft and everyone in here is goong to burn in hell. needless to say she was escorted out and later on her oldest son came in and had to apologize for his mothers radical behavior.	454	30729	blna2q	emqqw8n

"we had a regular we called ""body pillow kid"" because he would always ask if we sold waifu body pillows. he usually came in with his dad who was a huge gross nasty pervert. something was clearly up with bpk mentally but his dad's behavior was just totally over the line unacceptable. they never bought anything and just came in to harass our staff. it was a bunch of ""i'm not paid enough to deal with this bullshit"" fuckery. list of things body pillow kid and his dad did to me while i was working there: 1: tell me they would pay me to ""just exist"" in swimwear at their house 2: show me a sketch book made up of self drawn hentai 3: made me get up on a ladder because they ""wanted one of the pop's at the top"" only for me to grab one, come down, and them tell me they just wanted to ""look at my ass at eye level"" 4: stalked me out of the store to my car 5: cornered me in the cash wrap while i was alone in the store so i couldn't get away from them 6: told two of my associates ""lesbians are nasty but if you wanted to make out for us we wouldn't complain"" or something along those lines 7: said to me ""i'd like to choke you like a bitch, doll face"" we eventually had to go off and beg our store manager to ban them. she didn't (and made it clear we weren't allowed to) but we eventually were so cold and ignored the dad so much that they stopped showing up. i regularly had to call my store manager or security about them and felt so unsafe/gross at our store. gotta love a store manager who would risk the safety of her team for a potential sale! :d i worked there for over 2 years and every moment seemed like an absolute horror fest. i probably have a million stories. met my best friend there so i guess i can't be too upset. :/"	234	30729	blna2q	emqp8if

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh buddy. i have 8 years of stories that i can tell. mostly, the job was great. i loved most of my customers and my employees. my managers would vary on the years. one customer liked to get too friendly with the girls (most of which were under 18 and he was nearing 50) and id have to send them to the back so he wouldnt try to touch them. another guy that was known to be a shoplifter around the mall came in one day and stole from me. one of my cool customers chased after him and didnt get the stuff back, but did yell at security at being awful. i also got into yelling matches with the lazy mall security because they wouldnt do shit about this guy because they didnt see him steal. even though everyone else did. my first district manager was flat out cruel. when she left the company and came to the store to shop, i started having an anxiety attack because the backroom was a mess (it was the holiday, we were understaffed) and i thought she would write me up for it. i had men tell me about their jacobs ladder piercings and had them ask if i could size that jewelry which i quickly shot down. there was one guy who smelled so bad that wed have to febreeze the store after he left and it would still smell like death. there are so many more. people fighting on black friday, women telling me i had child bearing hips and i should have kids already. and the one time some lady came in to return a christmas gift for her daughter and i asked if her kid would like something else. her response? my daughter passed away on christmas. which was heartbreaking.	354	30729	blna2q	emqqam9

"i worked there for over two years. was the the stock guy dealing with all the new product my store had. 1. we had a chase funko pop come out and unfortunately i didn't get to till way later, late enough that the person first in line left. and everyone moved up in the line. when i got to said funko pops and put them out, i heard a lot of angry words, swears and a threat on my life. since he didn't get the funko pop and left the line, there was no way for him to get a chase pop. so he started threatening me and my store. 2. when we got new shipment, it was my job to process it and put it out on the floor. i opened this box up and out popped a tekashi 69 shirt. i immediately emailed my dm, corporate, and our company guy that deals with shirts. literally saying, ""because of what this man has done, i don't feel comfortable putting them out, they'll be locked up till you tell me otherwise."" in the next 3 days, we got an email to destroy and discard them after ""a lot of employees brought it to our attention that tekashi 69 isn't someone we should support at hot topic"" i have more if yall want them. fucking retail."	163	30729	blna2q	emqq7pb

"i worked there for a year or so. one day a lady comes in the store with her (presumably) daughter, asking me what gauge her piercings were because they forgot what the piercer said they were and this would be her first pair after the initial pierce. (these were snakebites.) so i told them i couldn't know for sure, but generally they're the smallest size we carry. things were pretty normal, getting them out of the case, the transaction, whatever. then she asks me to change them for her daughter. she was around 16 or so, quiet girl who seemed pretty embarassed by her mother. i had to explain how it was unsanitary for me to basically stick my fingers in her daughter's mouth to change them for her. she flipped out and wanted a refund. technically, since the package hadn't been opened/left the store, i got management approval to refund her. manager walks away after approving it, i put my hand out to grab the pack of piercings. this lady opens the pack and tells her daughter to switch out the rings she had in her mouth with the brand new ones, telling me, ""you can just clean and resell these. it's not a big deal."" &#x200b; lady could no longer get her refund. security had to be called."	80	30729	blna2q	emr302v

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	oh man its my time to shine. i worked at hot topic for 4 years, so i have several. 1. this one happened when they first released their jean brand. they had sent us all sorts of signage for the promo sale and were holding a store contest among the districts for who could sell the most jeans for the month, i dont remember what the prize was but my manager was really determined to win so he made it so we all had to wear the jeans during our shift, ok fine not a problem, the catch was he picked them out and he always chose super skinny tight ones (all of us employees were underage girls, oldest being 18) and on top of that he made stickers and buttons for the promotion on his own dime, that said : ask me how to get into my pants! :| you can imagine how that turned out. 2. had a chick straight up take a shit in the dressing room. our store is one of the smallest, and theres never a point at which someone could be out of your sight and there was only one dressing room so i knew exactly who did it. i let her in to try on halloween costumes and noticed she didnt bring anything out with her, so as per protocol i went in to see if the merchandise was in there and i walked into a huge pile of shit smeared all over the merchandise and mirror/walls. it was fucking gross. my manager tried to make me clean it up. we couldnt even really do anything about it either. we asked her about it and she insisted she didnt do it. 3. a couple and their baby came in one day, it was a busy day, but i recognized the chick because she was a well known local stripper who would frequently come in an hour before closing and spend hundreds of dollars on random shit while she was strung out and then try to return it- clearly worn and used- a few days later. anyways this time, she was there with her boyfriend (im assuming) and they were walking around arguing and fighting about something. she ended up leaving and shortly after he followed. not too long after that the store is empty and i start hearing a baby. sure enough, these people left their infant in his car seat on the damn floor. we called the police obviously, but they returned not long after that for the baby.	214	30729	blna2q	emqq9wa

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	last summer in the evening three guys came in to harass me. im a female and i was working alone because we werent expected to make enough that day to justify having more than one person working. one of the three guys who came in stood back by our jewelry thing and claimed that someone from spencers had sent them there to ask for our advice for peeing on a girl during sex. at this point the other two were laughing their asses off. and i was immensely uncomfortable but because who knows what their intentions were i had to try to be polite because the last thing i needed was for them to call corporate and make a complaint. all the while there were two other guys up by the front counter who were looking at the new pop releases for the day who watched the entire thing go down and not say anything but expressed that the situation was messed up after those three left. the whole night i was paranoid to do my bank deposit because i wasnt sure of those three would still be in the mall and i called up an old coworker of mine to walk with me. honestly i dont have a problem when customers are genuinely looking for some weird shit, but that was straight up harassment.	751	30729	blna2q	emqkozw
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i actually have mostly good stories about the time i worked at ht. i took the position as an asm when i was between jobs and ended up staying almost three years. one thing i havent seen mentioned often in this thread is how many strippers shop at ht. its like a one stop shop for dancers. we sold body glitter, scented body spray, decent makeup in non traditional colors, crazy platforms and spike heels, a ton of lingerie at a relatively cheap price, accessories, body jewelry, cheap hair dye, and colored wigs/hair extensions. i absolutely could not tell you how many of my regulars were local dancers, maybe 50? lets just say whatever bank teller processed our cash deposits probably wondered why so many of the one and five dollar bills sparkled and smelled like cotton candy. the sm when i was hired was a woman, and she seemed to favor hiring other women, so most of my staff was girls. i did have a few male sales associates, and b was my favorite. he was a straight edge christian metalcore kid fresh out of high school and obsessed with girls. he was a good kid, and i would always try to schedule us together, because he was genuinely nice and great at customer service, he was a hard worker, and we would talk about girls, music, and video games while we worked. one day, these two dancers come in together, and lets just say they are on. most of the dancers who came in would be in sweats and sunglasses, carrying an iced coffee, like the exact opposite of what they were by night. super low key. not these two. they were dressed super provocatively, and when i approached to help them, they immediately made it apparent they were there to put on a little show and tease the guys at ht. girls flirt with you at ht, not constantly but waaaaay more than other traditional retail, but this was way beyond that. one of the girls asked the second if her ass was too fat to fit in the skinny jeans she had picked out, to which the second responded with some lewd remark about not wearing pants at all and slapping the first girl on the butt. they asked to get into the body jewelry case to see some pieces, which requires a key and supervision. as soon as they asked, i called for b, chucked him my keys, and told the girls, i have to go to my break, but b here will be more than happy to see to your every need, at which point i walked my ass out and sat down on the bench directly in front of our store to watch the show. i have never seen human flesh turn that shade of red in my entire life. b stood there talking to these girls with this look on his face that could only be described as panic mixed with terror doused in teenaged hormones. from my seat, i could tell the girls immediately picked up on it. they started stroking his arm while speaking to him. one of them held up some lingerie against her body and looked at him as if to ask him what he thought. i was having the time of my life. 15 minutes later, i decide to put b out of his misery and walk back in. the girls decide they have what they need and approach the register. b steps up to the register. the two of them start to do this bit where theyre fighting over who gets to pay for their purchase. each of them asks b to take their debit card. no, no, i insist! finally, b just snags the closest card and runs it. the loser of the game turns to the other girl, who just paid for their purchases, and says, well, i guess i have to thank you proper, and proceeds to shove her tongue in her friends mouth. now ive been around the block and seen some shit, but at this point even i was put back on my heels a bit. but b, his eyes were so wide he looked like a cartoon character and his mouth was wide fucking open. gathering myself, i was just about to gently ask the girls to kindly not in my family establishment when they stopped, turned to b, and blew him kisses with winks. they left and i fucking lost it. i couldnt stop laughing or grinning the rest of the night. poor b couldnt think straight the rest of the shift and just wandered around in a daze until we left for the night.	187	30729	blna2q	emr2afj
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	not a hot topic employee, but i am sure one or two would have a story about me and my friends in high school. i was a sophomore in high school at the peak of the scene queen movement and my friends and i partook in it all. right around this time hot topic opened up in our small town and suddenly other people had access to band merch, skinny jeans, etc. i was wandering around the store shortly after it opened with my posse and in walk some cheerleaders from our high school (our town only had one high school) and my friend loudly screams, i guess theyll just let anyone in here!. yes because hot topic is the ultra exclusive store for tru fannzzzzz.	270	30729	blna2q	emqq8mx
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	tldr at the bottom, lmao this got way longer than i thought it would be. so theres a certain amount of dealing with creeps that i feel like most ppl go through as retail employees, but at my store we have a customer that we all know as the hot topic predator. my first interaction with the predator was very odd. he was obviously hitting on me, and i was obviously uncomfortable. he traps you there by asking you more and more personal questions and seeming very interested in your answers, so i almost felt guilty trying to pull away from the conversation. i felt like he was a nice guy, he just didnt understand boundaries, and i have a boyfriend anyways. so i survive an uncomfortable first interaction, but he kept on coming back. he was always alone, and he never bought anything. sometimes hed try to talk to me, but id just act like i was too busy with the job to chat. then he took another victim. i was helping out a really sweet girl while he was in the store, and he trapped her in the jewelry section asking really similar things that he asked me. she didnt seem uncomfortable by it, so i wasnt too worried. they talked for probably 15 mins before she left. and then literally five minutes later he starts hitting on another girl. at this point im like really grossed out, and after the second victim finally escaped i let her know he had just gotten another girls number, and she agreed with me that it was pretty douchey of him to try for two in one night. so here i am thinking this guy literally just comes in my store to find goth gfs and im like real mad about it lmao. come on dude, go find some other breeding grounds that arent you loitering around a store bothering employees and customers. but wait it gets even weirder. i got a text from a coworker saying there was a guy talking to a girl in the store for literally over an hour, and he managed to catch him name. it wasnt the name the predator had told me, so i figured it was just someone else oddly spending that much time in hot topic. then, i catch him talking to one of my female coworkers one day, and she tells me he had given her a different name too. she got really creeped out. she let me know that she had met up with him once to talk about his small business and he was basically interviewing her, asking quite personal questions and wouldnt tell her what the business was?????? so now weve gone from your average overly friendly dude, to please stop hitting on girls in my store, to this guy is definitely hiding something and i never want him stepping foot in my store again. and that was the last ive seen of the hot topic predator, but im sure hell come back, and you know damn well ill be kicking him out when he does. tldr: a customer went from annoying guy that hits on every girl in hot topic to this guys hiding something and im very worried by giving us all different names and interviewing a coworker of mine for his business, but wouldnt tell her what his business was.	62	30729	blna2q	emr19on
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	one i can actually answer! i worked there for a short time over christmas as a second job to earn extra cash. hours were shit though, maybe 15 hours a week split into 3 shifts. anyways, the first one was when i was helping someone grab something off the bottom shelf. an older man and his still too old to be shopping at hot topic son were cashing out after i finished helping them. super rude, music snobs who hates everything but the classic rock shirts we sold. as i was bent over grabbing something for an older woman, the older man walks by on his way out, points to my ass and says thats what i want for christmas! while him and his 40 years old son leave laughing. i almost cried. secondly was the insane amount of girls coming in for billie eilish stuff. this was before she was super big so i didnt know who they were talking about. i got some of the worst death glares from those 15 year olds i ever have working in retail.	225	30729	blna2q	emqneov
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes! my time to chime in! ill never forget this because it still disgusts me to this day. this chick (i went to high school with her) tried to return a tongue piercing. its against company policy not to accept piercings back if the package has been opened, for very obvious health reasons. i could tell straight from the get go that the packing had been opened and i flat out asked her have you worn these? she answered yes. and got immediately defensive when i wouldnt take them back. after calmly explaining the company policy multiple times, i finally said would you wanna wear a complete strangers used tongue piercing in your mouth?! she huffed and left and 7 years later i catch myself wondering about her one brain cell.	113	30729	blna2q	emqs0kj

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	so i have too many great stories. one of my favorites is there was a time this older lady came up to me and asked excuse me sir, is there any way you could help my granddaughter get into the fitting room, shes apparently too afraid to ask anyone in here for help. and the girl, maybe 14 or 15 just screams its called social anxiety!! then throws the stuff she had in her hands in the air and runs out of the store. the grandmother just rolled her eyes apologized, and slowly walked out.	53	30729	blna2q	emqt7lt

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	so its boxing day, right?

"fuck i finally have a perfect response and this post is 11 hours old!!! well if anyone is still here, in 2008 i was assistant manager at hot topic. the manager hired me because we had flirted at my old job and he asked me to come work at his store and i hated my current job at lime grill. so i said fuck it and went to go work for him. he would always hit on me at the store. i was 20 yes old. i didnt really entertain it but we were cool, plus he seemed to hit on every girl that would walk in there. on friday nights he'd hang around the store and the employees and i would joke about how he'd seem to be flirting with underage girls but we also didnt think much of it because that was his personality. he was short, covered in tats, and actually pretty cute so the little teenage emo girls would come in just to see the ""hot hot topic guy"". he'd entertain them like it was fun for him to have little fans. he was 34 yes old but could pass for a highschooler if it werent for the tats all over his arms and neck. fast forward 2 months into my job and he was arrested. at a hotel. with a 12 yr old girl that he met at the store. she apprently got scared, backed out, and called her mom to come get her. good job manny you fucking creepy fuck bag. aventura mall, aventure fl for reference. his name was manny if you wanna look up the new stories."	97	30729	blna2q	emraq1b

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i doubt i will see the story here but i was probably part of a horror story for an employee. though really it probably was just a minor annoyance. my mom took me into hot topic because i was an edgy teen. it was the only place that had clothes that made me feel good about myself (like i actually felt like i looked good in them, especially with a bobbed haircut). well for whatever reason my mom decided she didnt like me wearing dark clothes with the cute little skulls and silly characters on them. she proceeded to make fun of me and call me a dyke (which turned out to a nickname for me amongst her friends) really loudly in the store. i just kept ignoring her and saying, well idc i like them the whole time. finally the cashier apparently had enough and told my mom to please shut up, he didnt like hearing her talk to me like that. if she *really* didnt like being in the store to just please leave. my mom ended up having a fit about him talking to her like that, he is just a child, how dare he talk to her like that, what does he know about raising a child. it was so embarrassing and i had to leave without new clothes. it sticks with me cause that was the year of school where i ended up wearing huge hoodies to hide the clothes that barely fit cause my mom didnt want to accept me liking hot topic	48	30729	blna2q	emr1izh
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	yes finally a question i'm an expert in answering!! i started as a seasonal employee and made my way up to assistant store manager. worked there for a little over 5 years, too! (would have been store manager but i decided to switch to something with holidays off, lol yay banking.iregreteverything.) anyway. * most customers were *really* awesome, even parents of kids just coming in for the holidays. but of course we had some strange birds, what retail store doesn't?! this is my fav story, and though horror, it is still wholesome ;) i had one customer who was looking for earrings for her son. i was showing her different kinds of earrings and smaller gauged plugs, explaining the process of stretching. in the middle of this, she calls her son over and asks him to show me his ears - *that he pops off his head and hands to me b/c they are prosthetic ears!!* inside i freaked the f*ck out b/c i wasn't expecting that, but i somehow managed to keep it together and ended up not only making the sale but also helping that little boy feel better about himself; he said that having a real earring would help make his ears look more real. at the end of the entire thing there was a tear in my eye. * had a customer who called and told me a story about how there was another worker there who, when she would bend over, he could see her thong and he said he made a joke to her about it but felt really bad and he wanted to apologize so if he could just have that girl call him so he could say he was sorry. told my store manager about that one before i talked to the person i thought he may have meant and turns out this weirdo was calling all the stores saying the same thing. * had a customer who wanted a couple of the women employees to try on shoes for him so he could pick something out for his wife. he was aroused. (but i mean hey he bought a couple pairs soooo win? idk.) * had a customer who would come in every sunday to give the entire working staff a hug. * had a customer who would come in every couple of weeks and ask if we had kermit the frog merchandise. (wow this list is getting long, lol. but man i used to love this job so much.)	90	30729	blna2q	emqx2kd
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"my roommate worked at one, here's what she texted me. ""one time i was literally just folding shirts at the front of the store, the side that faces out toward the mall and and some white woman in her 40s just screamed and then i looked at her and she did the sign of the cross at me one time i had a juggalo, in full clown paint, pay me for a t shirt in quarters a brony got pissed at me because we didn't have some sort of rainbow dash key chain or some stupid shit like that a lady called the store to ask about hair dye. she wanted purple and we had a lot of different ones. so i told her we had royal purple, lavender etc. and she asked me to describe the colors in depth to her over the phone and she got pissed at me because she couldn't visual what it looked like and then asked me what it would look like if she put it in her brown hair without bleaching it and i told her it wouldn't turn out and she got even more mad"""	89	30729	blna2q	emr03b5

hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"wow this question was made for me! i've worked in hot topic for 3 years! i'm 8 time employee of the month and really well liked by most customers at my location, so much so that i'll be eating in the food court and people will come up to me and ask if i'm the hot topic girl. anyways, one day i was working a shift with one of the assistant store managers. it was an incredibly slow day and we were just tidying up the store while chatting about our pets. since there wasn't much to do, my boss thought it was a perfect time for a break, so i had the floor to myself. our location is small and usually this is fun for me because i get to help all customers that come in. however right as he leaves, we have the nastiest, rudest two women come in. they charge right up to me and begin screaming at me in a chinese language, i'm unsure if it was mandarin or cantonese. note, i'm half japanese half white but people often think i'm just white. so cut back to the story, these two women are screaming at me. i calmly tell them i have no idea what they're trying to tell me as i only speak english and the tiniest bit of french. the one woman just starts shouting return as close to my face as possible. so i ask for her receipt. no receipt. if they don't have a receipt we have to ask if they have a points account so we can see previous purchases and make sure they did buy this shirt within the last 30 days. so i ask if they have a phone number or email with us. one is still screaming in her language at me and the other woman says i'm trying to steal her information. i explain that i just want to see when the shirt was purchased. the absolutely no english speaking woman pulled a different receipt from her purse and shoved it into my hands. the shirt in question wasn't even on the receipt and the receipt was from october, this happened in february. i explain this to them and say they have 30 days, not multiple months and the woman decides to say i don't know how the store works and she's done it before. i decide to at least take a look at the shirt she was trying to return. it was a pickle rick shirt that had no tag, not one but multiple stains on it and was oddly warm. i explained it needs to be unwashed, unworn and have the tags still on it to be able to be returned and the woman says ""yeah, no washed,"" as if i couldn't tell from all the stains. i tell them i won't be doing the return as if i had returned it i'd get some serious questioning from the store manager and the asm's. they leave and come back in about 10 minutes. right after the asm comes back from his break. they begin to scream at him in their language too. he is white, doesn't look remotely asian at all so at this point we were both kind of like, ""what the heck?"" i explain to him the situation and he agrees that we can't return the shirt. the woman then smacks me with the receipt she had and begins screaming in my face in her language. the other woman says we are too rude, and should be fired. i decide enough's enough and we'll call security. i'm waiting for them to pick up and my boss says, let's just do the return. then he retracts that idea once he sees the shirt. it was honestly gross. so he explains that the shirt needs to be unworn, unwashed and have the tags still on, the woman again says it wasn't washed. the other woman who spoke no english shoves my boss and screams more. my boss is the nicest person. like people are rude to him all the time and he still gives them service with a smile but will tell us his tale of woe afterwards. so he just kindly refuses to do their transaction. at this point i call security again but nobody was answering the phone. so we ask them to leave the store. they do, surprisingly. then, maybe 5 minutes later, they come back with a woman from michael hill, a fancy jewelry store who basically was trying to act as their translator with some obviously made up story that they were vacationing in canada and there was no way she could be bought the shirt in october because they had only been there a week. i asked how she had a receipt from our location from october and she ignored my question and just argued with the store manager over the return in question. after guilt tripping him and offering him a discount on rings if he ever needed one, she convinced him to do the return. at this point i walked away from the cash because we had other customers. as i was talking to one of our regulars, they were leaving. the one woman who didn't speak a word of english pushed me on her way out. had i not been at work, i seriously would've considered punching her. but this customer, who happens to think i'm one of the kindest and most helpful associates we have, gets fired up from this and begins telling them how rude it was and how they can't go around shoving people. the make the rude blah blah blah hand motion to him and smirk at me. nice customer feels badly for me and says he doesn't know how i deal with stuff like that. nice customer also tells customer service about what happened and that i'm great so if there's any complaints he wants to cancel them out. luckily there was no complaint but i'd be happy if i never saw those woman again."	195	30729	blna2q	emqq95u
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i never worked there but in my youth hanging at the mall was like totally the thing to do and hot topic was in my price range for shopping. the time in question i was super hung over and aimlessly browsing while waiting for a friend at the pager store when some dude asked me if i wanted to see something cool. i hate being approached in public so i just said yes. he proceeded to whip out his ber-pierced cock. i nearly beer-shat my pants.	71	30729	blna2q	emqqbhb
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	my first job was at a hot topic in a dying mall. i was 16. one of the worst parts of the job was folding t-shirts. it seemed like every person who touched a t-shirt would ball it up and throw it somewhere out of place. i probably folded thousands of t-shirts. but whatever, just part of the job. i started there when they first began their rewards program. my manager was always on my ass trying to get me to sell this membership. nobody wanted a damn membership, or maybe i was a bad salesman, but either way, i rarely signed anyone up. this was reflected on the weekly report sent to the district manager, and i even got written up over it. i started working there because i loved music, and their album rack was always down my alley. they're a musically oriented company, so they had this sound system integrated with a central server that played a selection of maybe 10 songs, to be updated every month. well it didn't update for close to 3 months. every day i would hear the same songs 5 or 6 times over, for months, and it *drove me insane*. to this day i still get burnt out on music faster than anyone i know. during my breaks i would hang out in the run down, barely open mall and grab a bite at the auntie ann's. their pizza pretzel was my shit, and the cute cashier would hook me up with free marinara. we would flirt and chat all the time. i eventually got her number, i texted her (with my flip motorola) and we planned to hang out. i had my older friend buy me a four loco, when they still had caffeine, and i drove to her place at 10pm to pick her up. we shared the drink in the car on the way back to my house. we barely talked, unlike at the mall. very awkward. i took her to my sparsely furnished, unfinished basement and immediately we went at it. when we were done we kind of awkwardly sat there and i took her home just after midnight. from then on she would come into the hot topic to look for me and i would hide in the back while my manager covered for me. i totally ghosted her texts too. soon after i got fired for showing up hungover too many times, and i started to work at the pac sun right next door. that place is a whole other story.	2906	30729	blna2q	empymbu
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	super late to this party, but i worked at ht for about 3 months. it was, and still is the worst job ive ever had. the management was just atrocious and the micromanaging was on a level i didnt know was even possible. so, i guess my horror story is just working there, with their pos system straight outa 1990. i purposely got fired by spending an entire open to close shift giving my employee discount to everyone that came in on a busy saturday though.	145	30729	blna2q	emqqm3b
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	ah yes, my time to shine. a personal favorite of mine was a weeknight that i was working alone, seeing as we didnt get a lot of customers that late unless it was a friday or saturday. i had pretty much taken care of all the organizing and cleaning up that needed done on the floor, everything that had to go out the next day was out. so i was just strolling around the floor looking for stuff to fold and this lady comes in. she looked young but i honestly thought she was older than me (i was 19 at the time). she strikes up a conversation with me almost immediately and i rattle off my retail manager jargon, asking if i can help her find anything and letting her know the sales. after she looks around for a minute, she asks if we sell any nipple rings. we did have a few, so i told her yes and opened up the cabinet that held that particular style of body jewelry. the rule was that we had to stand with the customer and be near them when those cases were open so they didnt steal. as she looked, she asked me to get down with her and look give my opinions on what she was looking at. i felt a little awkward, and honestly i thought nipple rings were a little much, but i tried my best to be friendly and told her yeah, that ones cool. and let her know we had more on our clearance shelves. eventually, while she was looking, she decided to dive into the story of how she got it, and how she thought the size of her current piercing was different than it should be. i nodded along and said whatever oh, dang. or yeeeah. it whatever to make sure she didnt think i was ignoring her. then she asked me if i wanted to see it. oh, no thank you. i believe you no, no, really! [her current ring] looks bigger than it should be. thats weird, but no you dont have to show me. she accepts is and moves on to looking at hair dye. now, she asks me to join her in sitting on the floor and seeing what hair color she should get. i obliged her until more customers finally came in (thank god), but before that happened, she once again asked me if i wanted to see her nipple piercing. again, i declined. she acted like i was missing out on something. oh yeah, and i also had a pair of 40-yr. old moms come in and flirt with me at the register when they checked out. one asked if they could take me and get me a drink for being so helpful and i told her no, im too young. and she said no one needs to know!, so i told her i was a straightedge, she asked if that included sex, and mentioned her friend was interested before they left. what a store.	36	30729	blna2q	emqs43m
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	i know im late to the game and no one will see this but i worked at hot topic for a year, these are my experiences. white teenage girls yelling at the top of their lungs at there parents about something and dropping all of the curse words; we tell them to leave because familys are around and they look at you like wtf. teenagers coming in asking for razors to cut themself with and then laughing with their friends; no joke that happened twice. during the time, 2006, everyone buying misfits shirts and then look at you weird when you ask them their favorite song buy them; mine still is last caress. people stealing shit. fun fact, if youre a girl, put your stolen stuff in your purse because staff cant look in there. i have learned that people forget how to fold a shirt when they try to put a shirt back and just shut it into the shirt stack. working the christmas holidays suck because it takes over an hour or two to put everything in the store back when youre closing. lastly, this isnt bad but when i worked there, they had the biggest storage of mp3s i had seen at that time. millions of songs to choose from when working and that was pretty cool. nothing to crazy but that was my experience with working at hot topic.	77	30729	blna2q	emqo5hw
hot topic employees of reddit, what are your horror stories?	"not hot topic, but i used to be a manager at pacsun which is very hot topic adjacent, usually the same clientele, in my case the stores were literally next to each other. this was in 2013 before kendall and kylie jenner were known for uh. what they ""do"" today. they had a fashion line that was sold through pacsun and were just instagram stars. well teenage girls fucking ate all their clothes up and every time there was a release they would line up outside of the store and go wild. one of the major and (pretty fucked up if you ask me) issues was the sizing. all of the sizing was extremely distorted from ""normal"". i know that womens clothing sizes often vary from brand to brand but this was just insane. what would normally do a size 4 was a 0 in their jean shorts. it was almost like it was designed to make teenage girls feel bad. needless to say we had a fuck ton of returns. also, there was one instance where kendall and kylie tweeted that they were in a pacsun doing a meet and great, they tagged the pacsun which was literally on the opposite side of the country but apparently no one read that because about 400 people called the store asking for them (i thought they were prank calls at first) and another 1000 showed up to mob us and left angry when they weren't there. so yeah, i fucking hate kendall and kylie."	56	30729	blna2q	emqv8n0
what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	not my fuck up necessarily.but i invited a friend over for a bbq. he didnt know anyone and has never been to my house but seemed really eager to go. so i was a little irritated that he was almost 2 hours late. i was just about to text him when i happened to look over my neighbors fence. the neighbor was also having a bbq. it was like it happened in slow motion. i saw my friend in the neighbors yard chatting up some old lady. our eyes locked. i saw the realization literally hit his face. i still laugh about it. i swear the guy turned white!	15256	18697	btm0yy	ep1ceqr

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i was a young software engineer working for a startup in 1998. wrote about a weeks worth of code, images, and html. there was this funny file named ?~ in the directory. i wasnt sure how it got there, but i wanted it gone before i checked everything into cvs. no problem. rm-rf ?*. i discovered my error a few seconds later when the directory listing contained nothing. no code, images, or html. turns out ? is a shell wildcard character matching any 1 character. combined with * all files got deleted. it was at this moment i knew i fucked up. luckily i was using linux. e2fs file systems had a utility called debugfs which allowed me to list deleted inodes and dump them to new files. took the better part of a day to figure it all out since this was before google. i recovered the entire project.	2138	18697	btm0yy	ep00fi6

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	i've told this story before, but i had invited this guy over to my place for dinner after we'd been casually seeing each other for three weeks or so. things were going pretty well -- we were chatting, getting along like a house on fire, and he was helping me cook dinner -- when i started to feel *extremely* intestinally unwell. i've always been kind of a private pooper, and i could tell that this one wasn't going to be fun, so i asked him if he'd pop down to the shop at the end of the road to grab a bottle of wine for dinner. he agreed, and toddled off down the street, and as soon as he was gone i *raced* to the bathroom and relieved myself with something roughly akin to the force of a. well, imagine [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn/), but in reverse. i took a minute to catch my breath, reached over to the toilet roll holder, and came back empty. *well, shit.* no matter. i had a full 9-pack of toilet paper in the back room -- i didn't have space to keep it in my tiny bathroom; it was a very small apartment, so i usually just grabbed a roll or two -- and he'd only just gone. i had plenty of time. cut to me, thirty seconds later, pants around my ankles and my shit-caked bunghole shimmying my way down the central hallway of my flat when i hear a still, small voice from behind me. &nbsp; ^^^'erm. ^^^*what* ^^^are ^^^you ^^^doing?' turns out he'd managed to get to the shop and back in record time, and was sitting on my couch in my living room with a perfect, *perfect* view of my little faecal burlesque. i was framed in the doorway like a goddamn renaissance painting. it was as though i was presenting myself to him in the worst possible *you like?* come-on in the history of dating. it's very difficult to have a civilised dinner after that.	5604	18697	btm0yy	eozw13s
what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	going on a long hike while in the marines. realized i fucked up when i saw my first sergeant with two rifles and me just recognizing i don't know where mine is. the what happened edit: copious amounts of yelling were had. since i didnt want to carry my rifle, my command figured i didnt have to carry any of my other shit either. i had to divvy up my pack among my squad mates and i rode in the truck the whole way back so i didnt hurt my precious feet (or something like that). my fellow marines sorted me out real quick. i felt like the ultimate shit bird. being stuck on duty in my service uniform for the next 24 hours yelling my general orders didnt help.	1637	18697	btm0yy	ep023ts

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	new year's eve 1999 i called a woman i was very good friends with (friends only, i was firmly in the friend zone at that time), she was also my boss. i had way too much to drink and was not in any way considered sober or even slightly so, i was pissed as a fart. i proceeded to tell this woman how i felt about her, what i wished to do with her and how i wanted to do it. i told her this for about 45 minutes. afterwards i continued to drink. several days later back at work she calls me into the office and asked me why i'd called her at new year, i pulled a blank, i honestly could not remember a thing. she also informed me that several minutes into the conversation/monologue she handed the phone over to her mother. i still pulled a blank, in fact i was so convinced that nothing happened i was sure she was winding me up. if anything like that had happened after all why was she still even talking to me let alone letting me continue to work with her. she insisted that i called and i refused to believe her. it was not until late january when i received my detailed mobile phone bill that showed a 48 minute phone call to her number late on december 31 that i finally had to believe her. the difficult part was facing her mother after my boss and i became an item. we are now very happily married but even now my mil still takes the piss out of me over that phone call. my wife however is very happy. edit- when this message was posted it was the 69th post on this thread - coincidence?	2493	18697	btm0yy	eozzmue
what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"halloween 2011. 3 men knock on the door all wearing masks. i laugh it off thinking it's some friends being stupid. unlock the door. handle flies down, door gets kicked open (realise i fucked up) and within seconds i've got my hands and feet bound whilst they begin to trash and rob the place. i escaped when my feet got loose, slipped my hands over my skinny butt (thank you high metabolism), ran to a window, opened it, climbed out and jumped from the first floor window. broke a fuck tonne of bones in both feet and sprinted to a neighbors house. i now have fucked knees and feet and ptsd at halloween time. get anxiety when someone knocks on the door regardless of the time of year. got addicted to pain killers for about 7 years and struggle with alcoholism. also really fucking sad that my favourite holiday was ruined. edit: i am indeed from the uk where we use ""ground floor"" first and then the floors begin to be numbered. tldr; let 3 home invaders into my house on halloween resulting in physical and mental health conditions that continue today."	1902	18697	btm0yy	ep0r4a5
what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"a female friend of mine  to whom i was admittedly attracted  had been expressing her reservations about an upcoming vacation with her family. though it wasn't being overtly presented as such, the trip was meant as a way of re-solidifying her parents' marriage, which had been a touch rocky at the time. they would all be driving from san francisco to redding (which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere in northern california), where they'd stay at a bed-and-breakfast inn for a weekend before continuing northward for some unknown destination. in keeping with the alleged purpose of this so-called vacation, two rooms had been booked at the inn in question. to her dismay, though, my friend discovered that her mother would be occupying one room, her father would have the other, and that she and her sister would each have to bunk with one of their parents. this was worthy of lament on its own, but it was made unforgivably worse by the verbal diarrhea that i offered in an attempt at providing comfort: ""aw, it won't be so bad!"" i told my friend. ""your father will probably enjoy sleeping with you."" a moment passed before i realized what i had said. then, with a feeling of growing horror, i tried to explain myself. ""wait, i didn't mean it like that!"" i hurriedly said. ""i mean, like, he's probably sick of sleeping with your mom. no, wait, i mean. i just mean that he wants to spend some quality time with his daughter."" if i had stopped there, i *might* have been able to salvage the situation. but as it happened, i decided that the best course of action would be to keep talking. ""i can't say that i blame him, really. *i'd* love to sleep with you."" she and i don't talk much these days. **tl;dr: implied incest, mocked mom, failed flirtation.**"	4392	18697	btm0yy	eozqnf7

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	so about three years ago, my dad, my dad's girlfriend, my brother and i went cycling around this lake like we do so often. my brother (15 at that time) and i (11 back then) decided to make a race with the finish being a parking lot. at the end of this parking lot was a barrier right before a bridge. it rained that day in the morning and obviously, my brother won by far but i was still going at - what for my age was - a high speed. when i finally got to the finish, i had to slow down, but my bike just wouldn't. that's when i knew i fucked up real bad. i ended up crashing into that barrier and hanging over that shit afterwards. my brother describes this story as so unbelievably funny because my bike was just small enough to fit under the barrier and so it drove on like 10ft, leaving me behind hanging on the barrier. well i hope i made your day a bit better. also, my english isn't perfect, i know. i'm not a native speaker.	434	18697	btm0yy	ep09kgv

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	more years ago than i can quite believe (until i catch a glimpse of my grey hair in the mirror) was the last time i drove drunk. it was a summer lunchtime and a handful of us had been partying for several days at a friends (parents) house. i was *wasted*, as was everyone else - so when a female friend turned up in her brand new 4x4 and promptly fell asleep the obvious course of action was for us to borrow the vehicle for a joyride around the lanes of somerset. this was, actually, pretty anomalous for us - drink-driving was always heavily frowned upon - but clearly under the influence of anything and everything it all seemed to make perfect sense. for the next while - i was far too pissed to know how much time was passing - we took turns speeding round the roads in what was effectively a stolen car, drinking and getting (even more) high. my turn came last and everyone was joking about our good fortune running out and us getting nicked/dying in a fiery crash (ha. ha. ha.) - especially with me behind the wheel, as we were quite close to the spot where id been a passenger in a crash the previous year. which was thoroughly reassuring. i settled in and started tearing up the lanes - cant remember what the vehicle was but it was great fun to hoon round in (and a bit different: automatics arent especially common in the uk) - and put on the prodigy for the ideal soundtrack. turning the corner i saw that we were at the start of a long straight (an old roman road leading to glastonbury) ideal for just flooring it - so thats what i did. at the end of the straight i made the turn with, i think, two wheels ever-so-slightly leaving the ground - and ill never forget the definitely discernible shift of mood that caused in all of us, like yeah ok that was a little close. its time to stop this. - just before i saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and my whole world got ready to go down the shitter. i had no idea how long theyd been behind us but even if it was very recent thing they would just have seen us taking the last corner on two wheels. at god knows how much over the speed limit. in a stolen car. very drunk. very high. with no licence, nor insurance. and pockets full of drugs. until then id always thought my blood turned to ice was nonsense but at that instant i understood: i really felt frozen. the car went immediately silent (apart from the siren which we could now hear) as i killed the stereo, trying not to panic, just thinking over and over: im fucked. this is it. im really, truly, totally fucked - and everyone else in the car thinking: hes fucked. totally fucked. thank god its not me. there was nowhere to pull in for what felt like miles so i had plenty of time to dwell on my imminent destruction, and to weigh up the pros and cons of trying to escape them (which wouldnt have happened anyway in that car). outwardly i was totally dispassionate and calm (to the extent that later one of my friends said hed decided i was either a psychopath or a terminator) but internally i was screaming, sobbing and already trying to guess how many years inside i was looking at. finally i saw a place to pull in, and put my indicator on like pulling back the hammer on my suicide. i took a deep breath, made the turn - and the police car just steered wide and sped past us. the lights were to get us to pull over, sure - but only to get out of the way. theyd received a different call. ive never driven drunk again.	757	18697	btm0yy	ep0f56x
what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"ive posted this in on reddit before, figured i'd put it here because its one of my favorite stories and it fits. so, my junior year of high school, i was taking a class called ""sci-fi and fantasy"". predictably we read books of said genre. we did readers theater (each person in the class gets assigned a character on a voluntary basis, anytime the character says something, the assigned person would say it aloud, the teacher was the narrator, and roleplay was involved if you choose to) on a couple books, one being ""the hobbit"" by jrr tolkien. so in this chapter of the book, my character, thorin, had maybe one or two lines so i was bored. this was the chapter where the eagles swoop down and save the day from the orcs. as the group was saying goodbye (i forget how the book actually goes in this part to the specifics, please forgive me) to the eagles, my teacher stops and asks the group, ""anyone wanna like to do the eagle part?"" gazes around the entire class and does a double take at me (i'm a fairly outgoing person, especially in that class with roleplaying) so i'm like ""f*ck it. why not right??"" and out of the silence, with zero warning to anyone, i just scream ""cccaaaaaaaaaawwwwwww!"" and did the best eagle screech i could do (it was pretty spectacular, especially for being very much on a whim). everyone stops and looks at each other. now its dead silent. nobody knows what to do, or how to react. so my teacher, pipes up after 5 seconds of pure silence ""ok. does anyone wanna do the actual eagle part?"" apparently they had actual lines where they say things."	290	18697	btm0yy	ep1t45t

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	"the year is 2015. a variety of mishaps affected my well-being that year, but this one was entirely my fault. the moment of realisation was pretty strong so it popped into my head on reading this thread. it's june. it's my birthday. because of the messy year i had had, my annual bbq featured more guests than usual. friends coming over in support, i suppose. my bbq had been sitting in the garden for most of the winter, but i didn't think much of it. i gave it a clean and fired it up - there was plenty of gas in the canister, so i proceeded to cook enough meat to feed a small village. this went fairly well, and i was down to the last few sausages when i felt a warm sensation around my shins. ""hey the-go-kid, what's happening there!?"" screamed my friend's wife. a moment or two later i realised what was happening. there was a 3-foot flame protruding from the gas canister. like a mini-flamethrower. the rubber seal had corroded from the time it had spent not being particularly well stored in the winter, and with the canister being heavily used, it had decided to go full ellen ripley on me. there were around 20-25 adults and 10 kids in the very small garden at this point, so i figured, i need to evacuate. we managed to get everyone out of the way, and i ran upstairs to get my tiny fire extinguisher. i exhausted this thing on the canister, but it was so hot the flames flared up again. fortunately for me, my garden backed onto the fire brigade's premises, and within 2-3 minutes, the professionals were there and spraying all my food in foam. they were happy to take the canister away, saying it needed to be cooled for an hour or two and they would do so while drinking a cup of tea. it was all fairly funny in hindsight, [but it was soon overshadowed by what happened a few months later.](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9f5zu8/tifu_by_moving_in_next_door_to_a_drug_dealer/)"	335	18697	btm0yy	ep042qi

what is one moment when you realized you just fucked up?	when i was 7 my parents left me and my sister ( who was 10 at the time ) home with a baby sitter who lived 3 houses down. it was in the morning and my sister had just woken up and wanted cereal but i had the last bit of milk . her being the petty person she is , decides to eat the cereal dry causing me to feel bad so i went into the kitchen and put coco powder in a plastic cup ( no liquid mixed with the powder ) then i placed the cup in the microwave for 15 mins in hope of melting the coco powder so my sister could put it on top of her cereal . as if on queue my baby sitter left to go grab something for her house and she left my sister in charge . fast forward 5-7 mins and the whole kitchen was full of smoke , **the cup was on fire and the fire alarm was blazing the roof off and i was crying niagara falls. i knew i had fucked up big time** . my sister attempts to solve the situation by telling me to fan the fire alarm with a cloth as she opens the windows and dashes water into the microwave ( note that the fire was small but was big enough for water to not be able to distinguish it ). enter baby sister who's now dumbfounded to how i was able to set the microwave on fire during her 6 minute absence , who now calls the fire brigade and my parents to alert them of the fire. lets just say my parents didn't take it so well but on the plus side a firefighter correctly melted some of the coco powder for my sister ( before my parents arrived ) all whilst dying of laughter .	41	18697	btm0yy	ep0i9nk

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my coworker has a big ego and thinks she knows best. we had a patient who received home visits. he had a medical condition that, if observed by a newcomer, might cause alarm, but we were very much informed about it and familiar with it. instructions were that the condition was normal for him, not a concern in itself. one day the patients wife and my coworker seemed to have some kind of power struggle/disagreement about his condition and treatment and the coworker ended up calling an ambulance (for his long term unchanged condition that we were very familiar with.) he was taken to hospital and while there caught an infection. this infection impacted his eating and he lost a lot of weight fast. his condition deteriorated over the next few months and he passed away. honestly it wasnt unexpected that he might pass but it seems the specific scenario it ended up happening in stemmed from that unnecessary hospital visit.	5497	31344	bmt72c	emzkdt3
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i'm alive because my aunt was born. &#x200b; my grandfather was conscripted into the romanian army as a medic, and his unit was one of the many acting as a defensive barrier, covering the nazi supply lines to stalingrad. she was born, and he was called back to bucharest from the front. while he was on leave, the russians launched operation uranus, which decimated the axis forces. he recieved word that his unit had been completely destroyed. he was never reassigned, and in 1948, my mother was born. &#x200b; &#x200b; i'm also alive because a bunch of romanian cows got sick. my other grandfather was a pharmacist, back when that meant actually making medicines, he was also a jew. the town he lived in was largely agrarian, and their cow herds came down with some illness that was killing them. he whipped something up that cured them. the townspeople were very grateful to him. so grateful that when the chief of police heard that the nazis were coming to town to take inventory of who lived there, he came to my grandfather's house with some train tickets for him and his wife. they escaped the nazis, and never got caught. my father was born at the end of 1945. &#x200b; i guess this is the opposite of the butterfly effect, really. rather than one small action blowing up into a much more important chain of events, two hugely improbable events are eventually lead to my birth(and obviously my extended family as well). and now, i run ads on the internet.	4455	31344	bmt72c	emzo6kj

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	this happened two days ago. it was early in the morning and as im about to leave for work when my mom reminded me that i forgot my water bottle on the table while i was walking out. for whatever reason i decided to go leave my backpack in the car and then walk back into the house for the water bottle. well that took about maybe 10 seconds total. it started to rain heavily on my way to work and couldnt see very well but i noticed the break lights of the cars ahead stopping suddenly and some moving off onto the shoulder and decided to slow down and put the hazard lights on for the people behind to slow down. well turns out everyone was breaking because a 4-5 car accident had just happened seconds before. all the cars were scattered across the highway spread across the left/right shoulders and another had hit the crash barrier, basically a total bad mess. the drivers were still in their cars i guess processing what had just happened. after seeing it i immediately started to think that if i hadnt gone back for the water bottle theres a chance that i could have easily been in the accident or at least even closer to it. it tripped me out for the rest of the day.	4729	31344	bmt72c	emzlwv3

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my mother had a deaf friend in middle school for about a week until she moved. she had learned a couple of signs and the alphabet to communicate with her. had me a few years later and taught me what she knew. my middle school and highschool had large deaf populations, so i communicated with them with what i knew from my mom. it really fascinated me.decided i wanted to interpret, took asl in highschool, and eventually went to one of the three schools in the country to offer studies in interpreting asl. met my partner, moved in with him and his family, and now here i am. no longer majoring in asl, but because my mom met a deaf girl in fifth grade, i went to my school, met my partner, and found what i really want to do.	1493	31344	bmt72c	emznmst
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	just last month, a friend of mine told me a story from his recent heartbreak. he (lets call him mickey) had been with this girl (minnie) for almost 4 years when out of nowhere, she told him she is leaving him and moving out. he had no idea the relationship was in jeopardy, but she dipped. anyway, a few weeks go by. mickey is hanging out with a coworker of his with who he had just recently met and ends up back at his place just to hang out. on the fridge, he sees a note in minnies handwriting. the note detailed several issues in mickey and minnies relationship and so mickey asks his new friend where he found this note. turns out, this new buddy had gone to the same music festival as mickey and minnie a few months prior. the friend had found the note on the ground of the parking lot and thought wow, what a sad and angry note. im going to keep this because its so raw and interesting. the next day, minnie came over to pick up some of her things. mickey produced the note and it led to a long tear-filled conversation about their relationship and what went wrong. they didnt end up back together, because despite the pseudonyms, this is no disney story. however, the resulting discussion helped them both achieve closure in a meaningful way. all because a random coworker found and kept her discarded note in a festival parking lot. edit: a bunch of you are saying minnie was hooking up with the coworker but i can assure you that was not the case. mickey and minnie had never even met the coworker, as mickey and the coworker both work jobs for a massive company and had never crossed paths until well after minnie left. mickey and him had just become friends days after the breakup. as for why he kept the note, hes just that kind of guy. he was moved by the content of the note so he kept it. they werent having an affair or anything - and if they were, thatd be well over because minnie moved to another city the same week she left mickey. dont be too cynical folks. sometimes things just dont work out. edit 2: and for those thinking mickey is partly at fault for the relationship ending and being oblivious to the reasons for her sudden leaving. of course he is. and he recognizes this. he recognizes his role in the situation and doesnt hate her or anything. he just wants her to be happy and is heartbroken over both of their failures in making that happen. hes a good guy, and hes learning. edit 3: for people saying i am in fact mickey, i am not haha im happily married for one year and you could probably comb through my other comments to prove it if you really wanted but that would be boring. however, if you prefer the narrative that i am mickey, far be it from me to dissuade you.	5255	31344	bmt72c	emzmm2q

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i suffered with ball pain for a week or so to save a life. when i was a kid my family went from the uk to visit my auntie who worked as a nurse in germany. being obsessed with lego at the time i was excited to be getting to go the original lego land in denmark on the friday of the week for the weekend. queue waking up to crippling pain in my groin early in the week. after assuming it was just strain and waitin a few days, on thursday i was given the choice of going to denmark the next day or heading to the hospital and staying. i chose the hospital since i was in that much pain. turns out there wasnt anything to do but take pain killers and chill. when it got round to the saturday my aunt went out to get me some lego to cheer me up. her and my brother stopped at a swimming pool for a while on the way back where she was throwing some of those weight toys that they got from the toy store into the pool for him to dive down and get. some german teenagers were taking the toys so my aunty tried to shout at them in broken german so they left to a deserted part of the pool. next minute they pull out a toddler from the pool, completely unconscious. the life guards apparently had no clue what they were doing and were trying to call an ambulance so my aunt stepped in and performed cpr until the kid got airlifted to a hospital. a week or so later my pain had subsided so we headed back to the pool. a woman came over to ask for some chairs in german and my mum said sorry we are english and the woman asked in english instead. she turned back around and said you wouldnt by any chance know the english nurse that saved a little boy last week? and she replied yes its my sister. the woman said it was all over the local news that this anonymous english nurse saved the boys life, and she wouldnt have even been in the country if we were in denmark at the time, let alone be at the pool, sending away the teens to find the kid and then saving him. i still have never felt more glad to get a pain in my balls.	113	31344	bmt72c	emzu89z
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	when i was at college, i had this buddy who i used to give a ride to and from the campus each day because we lived a couple of streets apart. one morning ive got goldfinger (the ska band, not the bond movie) playing on my cd player in my car. hed never heard them before, really dug it and asked me about them. it was the day before easter break and he was like cool, ill check them out. cut to two weeks later, hes telling me how he has bought all their records, got his long-distance girlfriend into them when he visited her and has basically listened to nothing but them since we spoke about it. i feel good for helping a buddy discover his new favourite band, but think nothing more of it. that summer me and this dude have a falling out (long story, but the tl;dr is that he screwed me out of nearly 1000) and a bit later, i stop seeing him around. after a while a mutual friend tells me hes dropped out and moved away. the next summer, a friend of mine asks me if i want a ticket to see reel big fish that evening. his sister was supposed to go but is really sick and cant. i say sure and tag along. we get there and it turns out the support band is goldfinger, which is pretty cool. so were standing there, having a beer in between bands and i clumsily knock some girl who is walking pasts drink out of her hand. i turn and apologise and offer to buy her a replacement. while were waiting the bar we get to talking and were getting on pretty well. me and my friend end up hanging out with her and her sisters the whole night, having a great time and me and this girl end up exchanging numbers. cut forward again a couple of years. me and said girl have been together basically since that night. were moving in together and its going really great. the night we move in together, were sitting amongst all our boxes of shit on the only seats that are unpacked and i say something like; imagine if i hadnt taken [friends] offer to go to that rbf show that night. wed never have met shes then like not only that, imagine if you hadnt bumped into me and we hadnt got to talking. our original plan that night was to leave after goldfinger played as they were the only band we were bothered about seeing i commented something about how i really liked them or something, i forget what. and then i ask how she got into them and, im paraphrasing but the long and short of it was: oh my sister got me into them. her douchebag ex-boyfriend got her into them. they were long distance while she studied in the us. they used to go to shows together when he would visit. hes actually from round here i think yup. same dude that i used to give rides to. bonus butterfly effect: my buddy who was with me at that show actually ended up marrying the sister in question last year. tldr: managed to set myself and a buddy up with serious relationships, just by introducing some random dude who i used to give a ride to school to a band that i liked. edit: to add clarity to all this, i will say that me and said girl are no longer together - this was all quite a few years ago now. we remain very close friends to this day and were respectively best man and maid of honour at my friends/her sisters wedding last year. shes married to a lovely lady from scotland and has been for 4 or so years now. theyve just adopted their first son. ive been married to my wife for nearly 2 years now. although you could even add that to the butterfly effect of it all, as it was the same girl that got me the job where i ended up meeting my wife. life is fucking weird.	526	31344	bmt72c	en01wyw

"(obligatory) not my story, but my ex-wife's. we're still friends though. so i think this story takes place in the summer of 2003. might have been 2004, not sure, but i think it was 2003. she was up in cape cod because her grandmother had a house out in eastham. her whole family is up there visiting, her parents, some cousins, a bunch of people. one day she borrows her mom's minivan to drive into boston to meet up with a friend. she's driving back late at night, and the road is pretty deserted. all of a sudden she sees some kind of animal up on the road ahead. she's not sure but she thinks it might be a wolf. she slams on the brakes. i'm talking, shit-goes-flying kind of slam on the brakes. it's scary and chaotic and the wolf, or whatever it is, eventually runs off. she drives the rest of the way to her grandmother's house, and tries to discreetly tell her dad what happened. but the oldsters in the room have cottoned on to the fact that a secret is being shared and they all want to know what happened. eventually the story comes out. my wife's grandmother, who, god love her, would go on to live to the age of 97, responded by saying, ""that's why women shouldn't drive at night."" i found this response absolutely *hilarious* and for years i enjoyed making reference to it at inappropriate times and circumstances. anyway, everyone goes to bed and all seems well. until the next day when my ex is driving the same van back out towards boston. now, cape cod is pretty much a 1-way-on, 1-way-off kind of an island. and i forgot to mention but it's the end of a holiday weekend, i think it was the 4th of july. so traffic is really crazy. eventually she is at a standstill on the main road for so long, she puts the van in park to wait. and then when traffic moves again she can't get it back out of park. like, it just won't shift out of park, no matter what she does. she turns the car off and back on. nope. nothing. so now she has a car in murderously awful traffic, on a road that (if memory serves) only has 2 lanes to begin with, and she can't move. she can't get out of the way. she's stuck and making already bad traffic much worse. she's by the side of the road and people are driving by screaming obscenities at her. and she's thinking, ""believe me, i would *love* to fuck off right about now but this car is broken and i don't know what to do!"" so after what seems like forever, eventually these 2 guys stop to help. and they're trying to figure out what's going on. it's a really weird problem and it's taking them awhile. and the whole time, my ex is thinking, this one guy looks kind of familiar. like, she keeps eyeing him, you know. trying to figure out if she knows him. and if she does, where does she know him from. now, at this point, i'll mention the answer to the car riddle, which the 2 guys sadly never figured out. it turns out, (and i know how crazy this sounds), that the following had happened: when she stopped short for the wolf, a coin somehow got lodged in the cigarette lighter. it eventually caused a short circuit. the circuit that blew was also connected to the gear shifter. so when the short happened, she was no longer able to shift. insane. back to the 2 guys. the one guy notices my ex noticing the other guy and trying to figure out why he seems familiar. and so finally he says, ""do you watch alias?"" and that was when my ex realized that one of the guys who stopped to help her was bradley cooper. unfortunately, selfies weren't really the standard at the time that they are today, so she didn't think to include herself in the picture she took of the 2 guys. but she does have the picture of bradley cooper and his friend, the nice guys who stopped and tried to help her with her car trouble. and she didn't recognize him at all at the time, but much later she realized, from looking at the picture, that the other guy was bryan callen. so, to review, some kind of animal was hanging out in a road on cape cod one night, and as a result my ex-wife met bradley cooper and bryan callen."	1346	31344	bmt72c	emznq7n
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	if my former roommate wasn't an alcoholic going thru withdrawal and had to be hospitalized, we'd have had enough money for rent. then, i wouldn't have moved home. if i hadn't decided, while looking for a new job in my hometown, that it would be nice to have insurance, i'd have got another restaurant job instead of a manufacturing job. if i hadn't started that manufacturing job, i'd have never met a co-worker who was quitting for a much better job. then, i wouldn't have *also* applied for a job with that company that was still hiring. i still work here 8 years later and hope to retire from here. it has its shitty days (or weeks), but the benefits are amazing and i'm making more than most college graduates.	573	31344	bmt72c	emzloun

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i realised that i have come full circle in being a loser. years ago, i was a cashier in a walmart type store and lived in a trailer park, in number 38. over a 25 year period, i went to college twice (2 one year programs) , bought a house, got married, got divorced, sold a house, been single mom, had my own little retail business, yet never really got anywhere. i now work back as cashier in a sobey's type store and live across the street in the same trailer park in number 48. it is incredibly disheartening to know that after all my efforts, i have gone absolutely nowhere in life.	394	31344	bmt72c	emzo5ux
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i'm a carpenter, and my crew was remodeling a house. at this point the house had no plumbing, so if we needed do a #2, we had to drive to the nearest grocery store. lunch break roles around. i get in my truck and head off to the grocery store to take care of my 12 o'clock restroom trip after eating my lunch. on the way there, i see a guy sprinting frantically down the road. i debate on whether i ask him if he needs a ride or not because i don't want to have to drive him somewhere really far away and not have time to have a decent poop. but it wad pretty warm outside and i could tell by his attire that he wasn't running for exercise. i pull over, ask him if he is alright and if he needs a ride. without hesitation he jumps in and tells me that he was late for work because his car had broke down. he asked me to drop him off at his house (which was on the way to the grocery store) so that he could shower and change into his uniform. i told him i could wait and take him to work but he insisted that he could make it from there. a few minutes later, i arrive at the grocery store. it's a pretty small one. and the only restrooms are in the very back of the store. past a bunch of storage shelves and pallet jacks. stuff like that. but i make it there just in time, and not a second too soon. i was in one hell of a bind. so much in fact that i do the unthinkable. i shit before i checked to see if there was any toilet paper. there wasn't. minutes pass and i'm stranded in this single stall bathroom. too far away to reach the papertowels. i thought about risking it and making a dash for them, but i couldn't stand the though of somebody walking in on me in the middle of the bathroom and my pants around my ankles. there was nothing i could do but wait. to make matters worse, i was still on lunch break and needed to head back soon. finally a guy comes in. i tell him i've been stuck in here for a long time and i need toilet paper. he tells me not to worry because he'll tell somebody that works there. i worry anyways because he didn't seem to think i wad serious because he laughed at my situation. asshole. finally i get the idea to call the grocery store from the bathroom stall. i ask to speak to a manager. i tell them i've been stranded in their bathroom for 45 minutes with shit on my ass and i'm going to be late for work now. i let them know that i didn't have time to eat my lunch now. i let them know that i was angry. he apologized for the inconvience and told me that he would be there in a minute with some tp. he brought it to me and passed it under the stall door. and all was well. i exited the bathroom and find the manager. who was waiting to apologize in person. a familar face. the same guy i had given a ride back to his house. earlier. shared a laugh that because we both helped each other get to work on time the same day. bought me lunch at the stores deli.	78	31344	bmt72c	en01vri
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	hopefully this counts, sorry if it doesn't. one of my friends (english male) and i (scottish female) played world of warcraft, (this was during wotlk) i took a break due to uni work etc. while i was away he had went up to this guy in orgrimmar and randomly called him a wanker, (his sense of humour) they got talking and became friendly so my friend joined his guild. when i came back after my break my friend asked if his pal could join the guild too, the gm invited me not knowing if i was male or female all he knew was that my friend wanted his pal in too so just assumed i was also an english male. we got talking on ventrilo and he was surprised i was a scottish female as he was currently living in dundee (he's a serbian/austrian native) we talked for a while, met up and now live in austria, we have been married for 7 years, together for 8 and have a son. we'd both been playing wow since vanilla, playing the same faction on the same server yet had never crossed paths. we always tell people we met because my friend called him a wanker!	77	31344	bmt72c	en05rni

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i got fired from a company because i asked a co-worker if he was gay in order to set him up with my gay friend. (i was 21 at the time and really dumb). i had some savings and unemployment money so i decided to try for a career in the movie industry. i worked for free on a couple of movies and gained some set experience. well the savings ran out and i needed to get a real job, so i answered an ad on monster.com to be an assistant at a pretty large porn company, since they wanted someone with set experience and office experience. i was the assistant to the head of production, which meant i was doing most of his grunt work. booking talent, locations, crew, managing budget, etc, as well as handling distribution and fulfillment. basically, i became a porn producer. i left that company, which was straight porn, and went to work for a gay fetish wrestling porn company, where i met a guy who would introduce me to another guy who worked for digital domain. he hired me as a day player on the italian job, and in the past 16 years i've worked on 20+ major hollywood movies, including avatar, suicide squad, and aquaman. so basically if i wasn't an idiot i wouldn't have the career i have today. makes it really weird when kids ask me how i got into the movie biz.	139	31344	bmt72c	emzuz0d

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	so my story with a man named marcus is full of these, but i'll try to keep this from getting way too long. we were in an open relationship since i was 16 (2006) after i (in my head) swore i wasn't into him but finally agreed to a date. we both fell harder than expected. between him being married twice and several deployments, we always found our way back to eachother and never lost contact for more than a few days out of 10 years. he was my person and i was his kryptonite. a little about him: he had a love for fast bikes and really enjoyed his time on the autobahn in germany, as well as was part of a well known bike club. fast forward to december 2016, all in a day he is medically discharged from the military (days earlier than expected), signing his second set of divorce papers (his idea), bought a brand new bike to celebrate both, and we were talking plans to finally be serious and committed to only eachother. i am talking to him around 7pm. 9pm i get a text from his best friend of a news article of a bike crash. body of motorcyclist missing. one: had i not agreed to one date, i would have never known a 10 year love that altered the entire course of my life. two: had he been discharged days later as planned, he would have not been on that bike, on that bridge that night where someone in an suv felt he was going too fast and purposely cut him off, causing him to hit their rear bumper and be sent flying into a lake where he wasn't found for 3 weeks. three: had that person not cut him off, the cop that had already clocked him moments prior (he was already in pursuit and pulled up right as the crash happened) would have had the chance to pull him over and give him a ticket, and he would have made it home, and right now my head would be in his lap as he played call of duty instead of me sitting here alone two years later crying about it to strangers on reddit. there are even more things that happened in between, but this is already too long. thanks for reading.	49	31344	bmt72c	emzskbe
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	this is pretty grim, just a warning. my uncle was with his pregnant girlfriend in high school and he wanted to bring her to a church picnic to meet my family. my grandpa told him she wasn't welcome there because he was angry at my uncle for the pregnancy. my uncle's girlfriend took off upset. she was hit by a drunk driver soon after while crossing the street, killing her and her unborn child. my uncle never had another relationship after that and is childless to this day. he's nearly 70 now. so if my grandpa had allowed her at the picnic, she might still be alive and my uncle wouldn't have lived a life of loneliness and solitude.	47	31344	bmt72c	en0635q
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	they were promoting at work. five people were to be promoted to a higher position in the casino (from floor supervisor to pit manager) a much higher paying, better position. it was a huge staff with many applicants for these five positions. the casino manager was bringing in each applicant and letting them know whether they were promoted or not. the three guys he brought in previous to me each took their rejection very bad. the guy right before me took it so bad that there was almost a fight (much arguing.guy really thought he should have been promoted). now its my turn to come in and be rejected for the promotion and i can see this casino manager is washed out by the last three guys.people taking the rejection very hard. i tell him its okay, maybe ill get it next time around and im of the belief that things happen for a reason.all bs, but the truth is i wasnt really upset at all. we had a nice chat about our families and i believe he was really relieved that i didnt give him a hard time. about five weeks pass, and he calls me up to his office, to promote me to casino administration manager. i get an office right next to his, and now share his secretary. it was the sweetest position in the casino. great pay, great schedule, tremendous opportunity and a ton of responsibility. it introduced me to all of the next level managers and owners and investors. my career took off and i just retired after 38 yrs. i held all of the highest positions that you can hold in my industry and had a blast. the guy told me one day, that because i was so casual during my initial rejection, and because i didnt break his balls at that vulnerable moment, that he thought i would be a nice guy to work with. well you know i had this guys back, for the rest of his career.	51	31344	bmt72c	en07hg5
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my mother and her five siblings were deported to auschwitz in may of 1944. soon after arriving by train, my mother was placed into a line of people assigned to take showers after their long trip. my mother was 13 and was holding her mothers hand, obviously very frightened. a nazi soldier spotted this and ordered my mother out of the line and into another line, which was for the work camp. the soldier had apparently seen my mother holding her mothers hand and thought it would be funny to separate them and make my mother cry, which she did. my grandmother told my mother not to worry, shed see her later. my mother went to the other line and was quickly taken away to the barracks. my grandmother was gassed to death about 15 minutes later, along with one of my uncles. my mother worked in the labor camp from may of 1944 until the russians liberated auschwitz in january of 1945. she lived with her older sister in romania for a few years after that and eventually met a man who would become my father. im sitting here, writing this post, over 75 years after that nazi soldier cruelly separated my mother from her mother. he unwittingly ensured that i would be born and so would my brother and my four children. had he sneezed, or turned away or was somehow distracted from his duties, possibly thinking about some fraulein or another, and didnt separate my mother, im not here today.	44	31344	bmt72c	en0jgo0

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	"in 1999 i was in navy electronic core learning about radars. i had been in the navy for about 6 months and this was my second consecutive school learning about electronics. i met a guy i'll call sb. we became fast friends and two weeks later he failed the class we were in together. he confessed that he was just tired of all the studying and tests so i gave him my super-detailed notes to study to help him on the next test. i actually tutored several people over beers and had taught a few classes when the teacher didn't know the subject that well. i was labeled a nerd by my peers and i was damn proud of it. anyway, sb took my notes to the chief's review board and they were extremely impressed with the notes that 'he was taking' and gave him a second chance. sb and i repeated this same process four more times; the chief's review board kept giving him second chances because they believed he was truly putting in the work to be his best because of my notes. i graduate radar school and get orders to yokosuka, japan and before i leave to go to san diego to get specialized training on the sps-49 i give sb all of my notes and tell him good luck. the son-of-a-bitch passed and got orders to my ship working on another radar! we met up briefly in san diego, hung out and when he left for japan i told him to have an open tab at a bar waiting for me. his radar school specialty was shorter than mine so i met up with him three months later in japan in march of 2000. we go out drinking, i get super drunk on chu-hi's and when we get to the quarter deck he tells the officer of the deck he doesn't know me and just leaves me. my first day on the ship and i just passed out on the front door! two months later that officer of the deck is my section leader chief and it turns out he's the combat systems divisional chief and he got mad as hell when he found out sb and me were friends since school, i helped him get to the ship and he just up and abandoned me. two years later. i should have let sb fucking fail. we stayed friends but our friendship was rocky at best. he dodged work as much as possible and 'no surprise' was terrible as a technician. i was naive and helping a 'friend'. then 9/11 happened. [~~in september 2001, chancellorsville deployed with the kitty hawk battle group in support of operation enduring freedom, operating in the theater for several months.~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_chancellorsville) i was on the chancellorsville from 2000-2003 and we never went to the gulf. when 9/11 happened our ship was doing a wetdock and we had a huge hole cut in our ship to replace an engine part. the entire fleet left without us and we didn't go back to sea until at least november. it's a cowardly lie that cg-62 was in the gulf and it's not just in wiki, it's in some other navy online mags. anyway, 9/11 happened and a few days later scrubski (dude had to carry a shave chit with him because he had this beard magic where he had to shave every 5 hours due to how quickly it grew) came up to me and asked me to sign a card. when the pentagon got hit it killed his best friend from navy schools. apparently, i had roomed with scrubski and this kid for three weeks. i could not remember it for the life of me but i said i would sign the card since. that's the least i can do. then he asked where sb was at and i told him up in our radar shop. ten minutes later i saw him red faced and super angry and i asked him what was wrong and he said, ""that shit bag refused to sign the card! he swapped lives with my best friend and you know what he said? he said, 'i didn't know him and i don't care.'!"" i said, ""wait, what do you mean he swapped lives?"" scrubski said, ""shit bag failed every fucking class in radar school but for some fucking reason the chief's kept giving him a pass. when it was time to pick orders he picked last and had to take orders to go to the pentagon. however, because he has a green and brown blob neck tattoo he couldn't take the orders so someone had to give up their orders."" i said, ""are you shitting me? your friend could have been here and shit bag won't sign a card for trading lives?"" for the next year and a half shit bag constantly reminded me in various ways that the better man died."	33	31344	bmt72c	en0imeu

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i'm alive by a decision my grandparents made back when north and south korea was just one korea my father's parents had a huge rice plantation and a lot of assets in the north. rumors of the country splitting were pretty rampant across the area but it was just that. rumors. they eventually decide that it's too much of a risk to stay. because it doesn't matter how much property you have if the government owns everything. so they took a boat to the south. 7 days before the dmz cut korea in half. they started life over with practically nothing. but they did ok. had 7 kids. my father met my mother in inchon south korea. they gave birth to me. now i live in america. 2 generations removed from a poverty struck third world country family. now i'm living comfortably in the middle class. life is good.	18	31344	bmt72c	en0iu9f
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	tl; dr mcdonalds likely saved our lives. me and my girlfriend were on a roadtrip around the west coast, and we had planned to spend a night in las vegas, go to zion the following day, do some hiking there and return for another night in las vegas. when we woke up to prepare for the zion trip, the coffee machine broke down in our hotel and we couldnt get our morning coffee, so we decided to go to a nearby mcdonalds and get some coffee to go. when we got there, however, they informed us that they had run out of milk, which made us a bit angry, but there was supposed to be another mcdonalds around the corner, according to our gps. we areived to the second mcd just to find out it has been permanently closed. at this point, getting a milk coffee from mcdonalds has become our quest, we werent leaving las vegas without it. the third mcdonalds we tried to find only existed on the map. not sure if it was recently closed or never existed in the first place. all nervous, we arrived at the fourth and final mcdonalds, we agreed that if they dont get the coffee there, well stop wasting time go to zion. to our biggest surprise, they had the coffee and milk, so we ordered and took the coffees to our car. only to find out that we were served a wrong order. after they replaced the order, we laughed all this situation off and went to zion. we returned to las vegas late in the evening, just before 10pm. we started preparing to go out, as we had planned to check out the harvest country music festival that was happening on the strip. we knew it was already late, but we thought wed go anyway. we turned on the tv just before leaving and all over the news they were talking about some shooting in las vegas. we decided that it had happened sometime before and went out. we were stopped at our hotel exit by a policeman telling us to remain in our room. we had wasted at least an hour in the morning, trying to get a coffee, if this wouldnt have happened, we would have made it to the festival in time. 58 people were shot dead that night at that festival. if not for mcdonalds, it couldve been 60.

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	my parents whole relationship is a butterfly effect, and without that, i wouldn't even exist. my parents both happened to know this one person, in completely unrelated ways. my dad used to work on the stock floor, and knew this person through other people--eventually becoming friends. my mom worked with this person, and became friends through that. there was a dinner party hosted by this person, but my dad was still in a tentative relationship with someone. my parents hit it off, but it took a few more happenstance meetings before their friends basically cajoled them into going on a date. my dad broke up with his girlfriend for unrelated reasons, and eventually began dating my mom. there were one or two instances when my parents almost broke up permanently, but something or someone always saved the relationship. the funniest thing about this is that my mom almost didn't go to the original dinner party; she knew she wouldn't know many people there, and her little introvert self resisted until the last. this was the biggest butterfly effect--had she not gone, she would have never met my dad. her parents (my grandparents) are also a butterfly effect relationship, which is a very interesting coincidence.	64	31344	bmt72c	emzn583

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	"**heads up: somewhat long post below.** when i was in primary school, everyone in class had to write the address of the secondary school they wanted to go to after graduation. there was a briefing of this in class and i didn't listen to a word the teacher said. so i wrote down my home address which was further away from where the school was. so, while most of my school agreed to go to ""secondary school a"" which is near to the primary school, i was assigned to go to ""secondary school b"" which is on the opposite side of town (much further from school a and my home). my dad tried to get me reassigned back to school a (where everyone i knew was going to), but the school was somehow already full and i couldn't get in. so the only alternative (other than going to school b on the other side of town), i got into school c which is nearer to home. interesting note: i was a timid, reclusive child in primary school, never really had close friends and was often picked on and bullied. so in the new school with new faces, i wanted to make a change for myself and decided to be a prefect for the discipline and boost in self-confidence. i became one of the only two prefects to stay one for all 5 years of secondary school (the other was the head prefect). also, school c was the only school in the district to offer ""engineering drawing"" as an elective, so i took the class based on the fact i was good in english and maths and that paved way to my current career as a civil engineer. my engineering classmates was also much better to interact with than my primary classmates and the childhood bullies. they were loads of fun and stupid that it helped me develop my sense of humor, wit, and self-confidence. i can only imagine if i didn't screw up with my school address, i would still be under the mercy of being bullied and restrained by my own self-doubt and crippling anxiety throughout my secondary school life. the environment wouldn't change my outlook and i might have stayed reclusive until i graduate secondary school without any career in mind to take. &#x200b; **tl:dr**: i was reassigned to a different secondary school because i didn't listen to the briefing carefully. without any bullies or people to judge me, i became a prefect to boost my self-confidence. got into the only engineering class elective in the district which eventually led me to become a civil engineer. new classmates helped reshaped myself into a more self-aware, open-minded and confident person. so overall, i'm pretty glad to admit that that one mistake was the only one i didn't regret to make."	15	31344	bmt72c	emzp25c

"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i tried to kill myself when i was 14 and was admitted to a psychiatric clinic. because i was a teen i had to go to classes in the clinic. a teacher there knew another teacher of a school he thought i would fit into perfectly. changed school. i felt home for the first time in years in that school. i met my first love there. he helped me get a more positive attitude and essentially helped me out of depression and selfharm. it didn't work out between us but he's still one of my closest friends. most friends i have now plus my taste in music is thanks to him. if i hadn't tried to end my life when and the way i did, i wouldn't have gone to that school, i would probably have a different job, group of friends, taste in music and attitude today. or maybe i wouldn't be here at all because i would've gotten even worse and may not have failed my attempt in the first place.	14	31344	bmt72c	en04qrh
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	tldr; learned programming out of spite which made my career possible &#x200b; i had no interest in computers or it, just wanted to play games (\~1994) but i had a cousin my age and i always was kind of a dick to him and wanted to be better in everything he did (except school in general). once he told me he learned to code in school (basically just copying html and basic) and he was totally into it. i pushed myself hard to learn it too and just kept doing it and showing him all the advanced things i did that he didn't know how to do. forward to 2005 i was still programming and founded a company that still exists today and i make a good living and just built a house last year with my soon-to-be wife.	14	31344	bmt72c	en06mhe
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	i got a fortune cookie that sent me to taiwan. i needed direction in life, but since i couldnt talk to my dead father, i went out for chinese food and got a fortune that said to teach is to learn twice. i milked it over and applied for a job at a local language school as an esl instructor. 2 years later, an earthquake hits taiwan and the company asks if anyone is interested in going to taiwan to replace some english teachers at their sister school (they were not killed, they went home). signed up for a two year hitch, got a promotion, then got a wife, a dog, a son and a daughter. because i like chinese food.	14	31344	bmt72c	en06tgc
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	back in 2015, my friend convinced me to try playing destiny. i got the taken king edition ps4 and got moderately into it. january 2016, right before i take a break, i find a really cool lfg group. we clear the raid quick, and exchange friend invites. april '16, one of those guys starts to livestream. i watch regularly because he was really, really good. one of the mods in chat scolds me for an tone deaf joke that i realize and apologize for, no harm done. later this mod casually advertises that her clan is looking for members. i join up, and she becomes one of my closest friends over the next couple months. not particularly exciting in the grand scheme, but i like to tell the story of how i met my bestie through a video game (especially because i may have never met her if that lfg group had been just a couple minutes before or after i looked)	30	31344	bmt72c	emznvbf
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	"not entirely sure this counts as a butterfly but past actions made unforeseen future actions possible so here. &#x200b; in elementary school this dumber kid (insults get justified i promise) tried hanging around me. i was everyones friend back then, but oh boy was this kid annoying. lying, saying my name wrong, throwing a fit in class everyday, making the teachers force us to include him, etc. i got him off my back saying something dumb like ""i have a secret strike system where if you mess up i give you a strike, you're on two and i don't want you to see what happens when it hits three, sorry man"". it made 0 sense and i came up with it on the spot but it actually worked after he begged me for a while. &#x200b; fast forward to almost-adulthood, he works the same job as my little step sister. he forces his hand down her pants, she calls me crying about it. i found his snap/instagram, added him on both, called him right up. he admits to knowing my sister. then says they were on a date. then backtracks to never doing anything. then goes to her coming on to him. and i got to say something like ""alright, i've heard enough man. strike three. you remember what that means, right?"" he went silent and hung up, blocking me on everything. &#x200b; maybe the butterfly is that the lack of friends made him a horrible person, but we're adults and that doesn't matter. pulled up to his next shift like wassuh."	74	31344	bmt72c	emzmwbo
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	"not really know if this can be called as a butterfly effect story, but here goes: i lived in a small apartment when i was still studying and had my own washing machine.it broke down at one point and had to go to a laundromat to wash my clothes, since the technician i called was only able to come and fix it in 1 or 2 weeks.the closest one in my street was closed once i got there and had to walk a bunch of extra blocks to get to the next one.while waiting for my clothes to wash, i noticed i forgot my book and my phone. (i usually put things i need to pack together so i don't forget something, and then forget them all together)because i had nothing else to keep myself occupied i was just looking around at the people coming in and out of the place.that's when i noticed this cute girl coming in. she put her clothes in the washer, walked up to a cash exchange machine when she noticed it was broken.i saw this happening and walked up to her to offer some change.she kindly accepted and started talking afterwards and kinda hit it off. she wanted to give me her phone number. but since i didn't have my phone, she wrote it on a piece of paper. once i got home i grabbed my phone to send her a text to say how nice it was to meet her and if i could take her out sometime. to my horror, i couldn't find the piece of paper anywhere. i walked back to the laundromat to look for it, retraced my route back home, to no avail. in the weeks following i couldn't get this girl out of my head, searching everywhere and feeling angry with myself for losing the paper. i didn't know where she was from, only her first name. this was before facebook was a thing, so i couldn't look for her online. a month or 3 had passed when i got an invite from a friend, who was throwing a huge birthday party. i didn't really feel like it at first, because it was in a another city about 4 hours away. eventually i decided to take the train instead and spend the night there. i did have to switch trains in a small city about halfway the trip. while boarding the second train i was stunned to see her sitting on this very same wagon, reading a book. overexcited, i walked up to her to say hi. she said hi back but immediately got back to her book, kind of ignoring me. stunned, i walked back to my seat feeling absolutely horrible. thinking that she was mad that i didn't text or call her back. judging by the look she gave me, i assumed i had no chance of redeeming myself. i sat there for the next 2 hours pondering myself what to do. &#x200b; before i knew it we arrived at the final station and she disappeared in the crowd before i had a second chance to talk to her. i almost felt ill with remorse blowing it again. &#x200b; i got the motel, dropped of my bag and straightaway left for the party. i still felt somber when i got there and after saying hello to my friend, immediately went to the bar to get myself a strong drink and try to clear my head. that's when i heard someone behind me say ""you have no idea how sorry i am for not recognizing you !"".i turned around and there she was, actually looking happy to see me. i explained i had lost her number and spent days looking for it. being all caught up in her book, and me having my beard grown out a bit and wearing a thick scarf was the reason she didn't recognize me on the train. she did tell me she felt sad for never getting a text or a call and gave me some playful crap about it. it turned out she and my friend who threw the party used to work together during summers. we spent the whole time talking at the party and continued all night after she followed me to my motel room. (no, just talking) in the end i put her number in my phone, emailed it to myself and wrote it on a piece of paper i put in my wallet. just to be sure! &#x200b; to this day, i always wonder how my life would look like if my washing machine didn't break at that exact moment. or if the first laundromat was open instead. or if i didn't forget to bring my book and was to busy reading to notice her. or if.it almost looks like we were destined to find each other. &#x200b; right now, we've been together for 15 years, married for almost 7.bought a house and have a wonderful 5-year-old daughter together. .and she still gives me crap about constantly losing things."	13	31344	bmt72c	en0l3pi
"redditors with real life ""butterfly effect"" stories, what happened and what was the series of events and outcomes?"	"in high school, i wanted to take french classes but my parents told me to take spanish because i would use it more. &#x200b; i took all levels of spanish in high school, aced the spanish test for college, and got put in the same class as my current boyfriend of nearly 2 and a half years. another butterfly effect that adds on to the previous thing: my older brother came home on spring break from college and asked if i would like to play dungeons & dragons. i obliged, loved it, and played it more in college. it helped me get out of my shell, meet the awesome people that are now like family, and helped me get to know my current boyfriend. &#x200b; hold on, it gets crazier (bear with me, lol). &#x200b; i had a friend from high school, let's call him d. d hung out with me and we played halo, but i needed to go over to my brother's apartment to use his washer (free washers are better than $2 ones in college). my brother was busy at the time, so we left to go to d's dorm and play pokemon monopoly with him and his friends. when pokemon monopoly ended, i started up a game of d&d and my current bf (who was basically a stranger at the time) brought out his mat so i could use it to dm. d and i aren't friends now (he turned into a ""nice guy"" after i started dating) but it's crazy how all of these coincidences happened. &#x200b; &#x200b; if i hadn't listened to my parents, played d&d, or hung out with a former friend, i wouldn't know my current boyfriend existed. it's crazy to think how some really specific events (the certain day we hung out or me playing d&d with my brother) led me to such an amazing person. &#x200b; it's weird because in the spanish class, we would never talk, but we saw each other every weekday. we actually spoke to each other first when i played d&d with him, and then we talked more. to add onto this, he introduced me to larping and amtgard, so if it weren't for all the previous things i wouldn't have been able to meet the huge circle of people i know now (including the guy who got us together, haha). so yeah, huge and oddly specific butterfly effect for this one :p"	42	31344	bmt72c	emzni79

what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	whenever people like jack bauer just call for some 3d building plans to be sent to his cell phone. typically, architecture/engineering firms don't send out their cad files to anyone. and if they did send those files out, there's no reason for some government agency to have them unless the building was owned by that agency. and they probably wouldn't be 3d (though that is becoming more popular). in reality, jack's friends would call up the building owner, who would put them in touch with the building engineer. then the building engineer would act like he's too busy to help with anything. at some point you *may* get some drawings from him. they will be scanned pdfs. a lot of them will be illegible. they will also most likely be out of date. then when mr. bauer is crawling up around in the ductwork, he'd probably find himself face to face with security bars that are in place to keep people from crawling in the ductwork. and that's if the ductwork is even big enough to have a full grown man in them, let alone able to support the weight. &#x200b; also, government labs. they aren't high tech, black-walled, futuristic super lab. they are nondescript brick buildings with no windows and furniture from 1985.	462	18364	boi2wy	enh5g2n

"how easy it apparently is to snap a person's neck. if our necks were that easy to snap, rollercoasters would be death machines. we aren't birds, our spines' only job is to stay intact so our brain still works. if they're that bad at it we would never have made it this far. also, hitting a person on the back, top, or front of the head with the back of a gun does not easily knock a person out. it causes at least a concussion if not permanent serious brain damage. there are a few select places on the head that won't cause serious damage, and the top of the head is not one of them. in the movies and tv shows, someone sneaks up behind someone and just ""bam"" on the back of the head. that has never, ever worked. and third, getting shot in the shoulder isn't something you just shrug off. you likely won't be able to use your arm for at least a week probably more. in action movies the star will get shot in the arm, then pull someone up with that same arm. the shock alone of getting shot often causes people to wet themselves, not kill the bad guy and save a million people. edit: of course there are exceptions to all of these,my quibble is the fact that in almost every single tv show and movie they get it wrong. the majority of the time for most of these you would die, but there are exceptions. edit 2: cleared up some confusion on my part about the knocking a person out."	839	18364	boi2wy	engqy0p

what is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?	i cant watch romcoms any more because they all follow the same formula to a point where the anticipation/anxiety makes me physically ill. 1) main character has problem. problem is not inherently large and would be easily understood if discussed early on in any relationship. 2) mc meets/actively pursues significant other, does not discuss problem. 3) still does not discuss problem. 4) problem resurfaces in a way that mc does not anticipate. so reverts back to pubescence in ability to emotionally handle problem and most likely leaves without any discussion. 5) mc delivers powerful speech about being sorry and how they should be together, so most likely forgives mc.	347	18364	boi2wy	engurzq

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	okay, it wasn't a bathroom floor, it was the floor of a laundromat at an apartment complex (at which i lived). i was 12 and got home after walking from school. but dad hadn't gotten home yet so i was locked out of the apartment. for the record, as a kid i didn't shit at school. couldn't. so now i didn't know what to do, but i knew the shit was coming. i tried holding it in i promise. i moved around, tried occupying my mind with other things, tried running. next thing i know i'm in the corner of the laundromat shitting on the floor. god i'm so ashamed to admit this even 15 years later. i have nightmares about the cleaning staff or the unlucky tenant just trying to get their clothes out of the dryer and coming upon a steaming hot shit right the fuck there. i try to convince myself that they all must've thought it was a dog, but i remember. that shit was distinctly human. it haunts my soul.	11123	51954	bniexw	en6cctq
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	on my first deployment, someone took a massive shit in one of the toilets and covered it with an entire roll of toilet paper and it stayed like that for days. then, someone shit on top of that first layer and covered it with another huge wad of toilet paper. about two weeks later someone added another layer of shit and toilet paper, effectively creating a shit lasagna. eventually it all disappeared, im not sure how but i just know one day it was gone and the madness was finally over.	8679	51954	bniexw	en6f8ap
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	a few months ago i actually walked in on this person literally taking a shit on the floor we were the only ones in there it was a couple of hours after school had ended. i really didn't know what to do and was still for a few seconds before she started frantically talking and said something about it being an act of defiance or something and was saying she hated the school. i kinda just laughed it off for a second before leaving and going to another bathroom. i didn't say anything to a teacher because i think she was a 9th or 10th grader and i don't know her name. definitely an interesting part of my education	10729	51954	bniexw	en69h9l

"i can answer this question. one of my brother's friends pooped on the floor of the bathroom while my brother and his other friends were outside the stall. apparently the guy sat down on the seat like normal, but with his left asscheek on the right side of the toilet seat. he said when he saw the poop hit the floor it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. later on one of the janitors was heard saying ""i just can't believe it. i don't know how it happened."""	318	51954	bniexw	en6cdfl

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	so this is slightly off topic but relevant none the less. when i was young i went to after school care at a local rec center. one day i was there and went to use the bathroom. i was taking a leak at a urinal and i kept smelling shit and i figured someone had just took a huge dump recently and thats what i was smelling. so i finished up peeing and getting ready to go wash my hands and just happened to peek at the ceiling. im sure at this point you understand where this is going, but directly above where i was peeing, there was a turd stuck to the ceiling.	10941	51954	bniexw	en665j6
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"sophomore year of highschool a bunch of friends and i were drinking at this dude's house (we'll call him greg). this was our first time drinking more or less and we were just chilling, having few drinks. we were playing gta and greg walks into the bathroom, comes out a few minutes later, and sits down. soon someone else goes into the bathroom comes back and asks, almost like he's trying not to laugh, ""did someone take a shit on the floor?"" we all get up to investigate and sure enough, there it was. a big, slunking turd presented to us in the center of the cool linoleum like it was on a silver fucking platter. we laughed ourselves to tears, looked up, and saw greg sitting there. he is trying his absolute best to not start laughing but this is the funniest shit he's ever seen. i ask him between my laughs, ""did you shit on your own bathroom floor???"" to which he replies, ""yeah! i dont know, i thought it would be pretty funny!"""	9355	51954	bniexw	en6brpi
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	for the same reason people knock over a garbage can or plug up the sink: it's a small act of anti-social behavior. i worked in a movie theater as a teen. right in the middle of the bathroom floor someone dropped one of the largest turds i've ever seen. the main log was incredibly dry and about the width of a pringles can. i still debate to this day whether the poor bastard shat that out real time, or multi-shat in an actual pringles can and then dumped it on the floor. given the size of the log, the time it would take any normal person to squeeze such a massive grogan out, and the absence of blood, i'm leaning toward the pringles can theory. edit: thanks for the awards and opiate poop education everyone!	17908	51954	bniexw	en67sa3
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	im using one of my throwaways for obvious reasons, i doubt anyone will read this at this point but its quite personal. im in therapy for a lot of things right now and something ive researched a bit about is something that i did as a child thats about the same what op asked. i moved a lot as a child, i wasnt at the same school two years in a row until 8th grade. in the earlier elementary years i used to smear my poops on the walls of the stalls. i remember it feeling out of body to me, like it wasnt me that decided to do it, it just happened. ive learned pretty recently that its likely due to sexual abuse in my very early years. its something like not feeling in control of your own body so youre taking control of something. its something that you make, that your body makes, and this is really all there is to do with it besides flushing it. i didnt do it every time i pooped but until like 5th grade i caught my poop on some toilet paper just to see how much it weighed. i never touched it to my skin or smelled it or tasted it. it was more of a catch and release sort of thing. and sometimes i would smear it. were going to do emdr in therapy about it soon to see if thats the source of a lot of my deep shame feelings. if anyone here has read this far, if you catch a child doing this or hear of someone that got caught doing it, keep an eye out for them. be an ally by (at the very least) being kind to them and deterring further abuses on the playground. help the rumor die if you can or just dont spread it. that may be a child in need of the most dire kind of help. edit: spelling and missed words. edit a bit more: this has been a very unexpected show of support and i thank everyone of you who have commented or pmd me. i hope your awareness and learning helps us collectively and individually end the various cycles of abuse that plague our planet. im nothing near a professional on these matters, just have found myself in a point in my life where ive been able to focus on my inner self and helping it heal from shadowy images ive unknowingly held in my head since i was very small. having said that, please feel free to reach out to me via pm if youd like to talk. this is a throwaway for me so i feel quite comfortable being very honest. seriously, thank you all so much for the awards too, didnt even know we had a platinum one.	8780	51954	bniexw	en6gdt9
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	reminds me of this kid from middleschool who kept shitting on this teacher's driveway. she was widely disliked, she liked to get in students faces and berate them because she knows that she spits her stanky tooth rot spit on your face while she yells at you. she liked to hand out detention over the smallest things, just on a power trip. anyway this kid finds out where she lives and shits on her driveway. a group of kids hear and don't believe him so he does it again with them present, except this time he shits on her doorstep and ding dong ditches. this gets repeated for weeks because whenever someone hears about it they dont believe it and he was all too happy to repeat it for you.	111	51954	bniexw	en6cfp3

"god, i hate to answer this question. not highschool, but middle school. i swear it was an accident. tl;dr - i had 3 days of shit piled up in my colon at the end of the school day, and miscalculated the proximity of my buttcheeks to the toilet, resulting in me shitting directly infront of a toilet. ok, so, there i was in computer class. we're on mavis or whatever that thing was that teaches you how to type efficiently. computer was our last class of the day, then we could go home. well, that morning, i was just not feeling well. i was the typical faker, and would say ""i'm not feeling well"" to my parents time and time again and pray they wouldn't take me to school. but i felt like shit. dunno why, or what caused it, but i was genuinely sick to my stomach and felt like barfing all day long. so, my parents tell me to use the restroom, maybe i'll feel better afterwards. i went, and nothing came out, mostly due to me being a little anxious at the time. i'm anally-retentive, meaning i pucker my anus as much as i can and refuse to poop anywhere that isn't my toilet at home, partly because anxiety, partly due to me being a mild clean freak. this makes long car rides and airplane travel extremely difficult, and requires me to eat very little before travelling. anyway, i digress. so, around lunchtime, i decided to have some pizza. pizza day happens once a week, and it's 50c a slice, so i was like, why not? i'll gorge a little. after lunch comes p.e., which i resented so much. who designed our schedule to allow a bunch of full, sweaty kids to eat and then right after, play some football? always pissed me off the way our schedule was set up. anyway, come p.e., and i'm like, waddling as to not shit myself. i had an opportunity to go use the restroom, but the restrooms were nasty, because sweaty boys + the pizza shits = a disgusting aftermath. i went to the restroom, saw the stunned remains of an absolute unit of a turd, which the toilet did not fully eradicate. went to another stall, just as disgusting as the first. third was less nasty, but there was something on the toilet seat (liquid, not solid) and just decided to wait til i got home to release the build-up of at least 3 days worth of shit. i should've taken my opportunity with stall number three. oh, how i regret that decision. math and history went off fine, in between those classes and my last class was a break, in which time i decided was a great time to get a snack and a can of coke. consumed both quickly and headed upstairs for computer. i sat down, and immediately the urge hit me. i waited. and waited. and waited. class started, and we were to do our assignments. we were allowed to do them unmonitered, as she was super lax and didn't care - we could literally cheat and she wouldn't care. i was naturally good at typing (thanks to runescape) and finished my assignments. i immediately darted out the class without asking to use the restroom, or with the bathroom pass, which was a big no-no in my school. i had a detention waiting for me when i got back, but i didn't care. i was just seconds away from my shit providing enough thrust to launch me to the stratosphere. i went to the bathroom, and wouldn't you know it, all the stalls are full. so, i did the only reasonable thing i could do. i went to the girls restroom. i then second-guessed that thought. so now, i was torn. do i wait? do i go down the stairs and risk shitting my way to the moon? do i risk getting caught by a girl in the girls room? i made a decision to go downstairs, and i could feel it nearly poking out my sphincter. so i ran into the restroom, pulled my pants off and placed them on my bag (i like to poop naked, sue me) and before i sat, i looked. it was the grossest stall of all time. *someone didnt flush! red alert, red alert!* my little 12 year old brain could not stand the thought of my shit touching someone elses shit, and risking the possibility of the shit splashing back onto my ass. so, i squatted above the toilet seat, and released. my calculations were so exact, that with the force i exerted on my sphincter, and the proximity of my asshole to the toilet, that i thought the shit was gonna land square in the hole, and all would be said and done. my calculations were off. by a lot. i was a good couple inches from being anywhere close to the toilet. so i shat *right infront of the toilet* i went into panick mode. i flipped out; do i clean it up? do i let leguizama (the schools janitor) clean it up? am i gonna get a detention for this? or worse, a saturday school??? so, i wiped, put the tp in the toilet, and didn't even flush. i washed and walked out, obviously panicked. i was so self concious and anxious at the time, that i sprayed myself down with the choicest body spray around, axe body spray, to mask the smell of shit that i know would linger around until i showered. i walked out of that stall anxious as could be, and got a drink of water, and went back to class. the next day, an announcement was made before the pledge of allegiance, stating that there was a dookie dropped in front of the toilet, and not in the toilet in the bathroom across the computer lab. for some reason, i felt proud of myself. i wasn't caught, and i'm sure mr. leguizama was the one who cleaned it up."	1429	51954	bniexw	en6ah65

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not entirely related, but we once had a rebellious kid smeared vegemite across the walls of the bathroom. the vp had all the male students assembled in the hall and he yelled at us for about ten minutes about how there was faeces on the bathroom wall and how the cleaner had to suffer cleaning it up. needless to say it did not take long for word to get around that it was indeed vegemite.	573	51954	bniexw	en66xe4

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i saw someone did this on my schools bathroom floor and all i though is what horrible person would do this knowing a janitor would have to clean it up. also my schools janitors are the nicest people so highly doubt it was someone doing it to get back at them.	267	51954	bniexw	en66icg
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i was in high school (maybe middle school) but we were in a local park in my hometown where we always hung out and played games, airsoft, and other random stuff. i had to take a shit real bad one day and i couldn't make the 3 block or so run to my grandparents house so i sucked it up and ran into the park bathroom. i had a massive turd 90% of the way out of my ass when i realized there was no toilet paper anywhere to be found. so i shifted a bit and dropped that large turd right there on the cement floor. i haven't really thought about it since then, and now that the memory came back to me a decade later thanks to this question, i immediately regret it all edit: sorry 14 year old me didnt think logically and not shit on the floor. if you think what you have to comment wouldnt persuaded me either way then idk, prayers your way. clearly this wasnt my peak so lay off, you buttholes	872	51954	bniexw	en67v56

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	or not just school but public places, heck even some adults do this! one time i was at the cash at walmart and just noticed the bathroom was fenced off and marked as out of order, didn't really think much of it but over heard a staff conversation from the other cash and someone basically blasted the entire bathroom with poop, floors, walls, and ceilings. how and why do people do this? walmart employees don't get paid enough to deal with that. i would hope that they brought in a special abatement team for that.	142	51954	bniexw	en69zdb
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i once took an insane amount of cough syrup during my high school philosophy class. the teacher decided to show a movie that day, fuckin great right? nope. 20 minutes in i got the strongest urge to just throw up everywhere. i didnt even ask the teacher to step out i just straight up left and rushed towards the bathroom. i remember throwing up at the very entrance to the bathroom leaving a trail of puke leading towards the toilet where i proceeded to regurgitate half my body weight. fun times at coral park.	436	51954	bniexw	en67ehj

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	once i was at a hospital where my dad was admitted after a heart attack. my sister and i, both adults at this point, stayed overnight. i had to pee super super bad and went to the bathroom like a normal person does for such and the lone toilet in the room was just like the toilets of my nightmares when i have to pee really bad and am having a dream of needing a toilet you know? full of blood, poop, tampons even maybe some pads idk i almost lurched anyway my need to pee wasnt going anywhere so feeling like i have zero choice - i had been looking for awhile for a bathroom that didnt say patients only for a good twenty minutes and it was like 3 in the morning i had drank lots of caffeine anywho there i go and pee on the floor. i find my way back to our little designated icu lounge we had kind of a private area with all the possible amenities of a hospital you could imagine decent ish lounge chairs, pillows, blankets, free soda and snacks all you could need with the exception of working restrooms. now, there were restrooms there in that utopia of a hospital waiting area but they both had closed for cleaning signs and had them for awhile. i feel like maybe they just put them on at night so not to be bothered with them and it seemed in all the little private family lounge areas all was quite except for ours and i guess maybe because the heart attack had just happened that day with an emergency surgery the adrenaline of the day made it to where we just couldnt sleep. so after doing my dirty business in the dirty bathroom i return and my sister is gone. now this is about 2004 or so, we had cellphones but i dont think we had texting or if we did it was limited and yada yada so im clueless as to where she was but unconcerned i had been missing awhile i assume she goes to look for me- we had some sort of device that the nurses station let us know if there was an issue with my dad so i settle back in and she returns to tell me the exact same story i had about a disgusting bathroom that she pees on the floor of because she sees no alternative. now were not sure at this point if its the same bathroom because we had both wandered aimlessly to find it. the hospital is big and all we both knew is that it we didnt leave the cardiac area- we were both scared of getting lost (in hindsight why we didnt just go together is beyond me). at any rate she said the floor had been wet but with the toilet i saw being overflowed and nasty we still didnt know. the day had been awful and my dad went from most likely being dead to most likely being okay by midnight that night we had been through it and suddenly nothing was more important to us than knowing if we golden showered the same bathroom so we went to find it. we stumble upon the place that, sure enough, we both had used only to see another woman stumble out, shell shocked, and advising us to find another toilet. fifteen years later we still talk about it.	50	51954	bniexw	en6crhi

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not the bathroom floor but on the last day of school back in grade 11, someone took a massive diarrhea-shit in one of the stairwells. it was all over the stairs; not sure if someone stepped in it or the pooper dropped his load while going down the stairs. edit: there were also frequent urinal dukes throughout that year. pretty sure my high school just had some crazed diarrhea-fiend that year.	87	51954	bniexw	en69afh
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	so best story ever. my first day of grade 1 elementary school. we get just a basic tour of the school facilities and we don't really do any real work. we're in the gym class getting a rundown of gym. we do some fun activities. suddenly i gotta go. bad. i ask the teacher to let me shit. he's like yeah. he knows what's up. i go into the bathroom he pointed out. i look inside. no toilets. all i see if these big tall metal structures with faucets at the top of them. drains in the bottom. wtf is this shit? so i keep looking and looking and no toilets and i really gotta go. so i just go into the thing and then pull my pants up and walk out like normal. later that day the principal comes on the intercom announcement and is furious!! he vows to find who shit in the showers. anyway as far as i know he never found out it was me.	40	51954	bniexw	en6hatb
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	not pooping on the bathroom floor in high school, but maybe related. once i was going to sleep on the couch at a friends house after a night of drinking out. we were all about 23 at the time. im just about to drift to sleep when i see a female figure, in the dark, walk into the living room, back up to a corner, drop trou, and start pissing on the hardwood floor. im all like, wut. am i really witnessing this? come to find out they suspected this roommate of doing this on a regular basis but never had proof. i guess she didnt know i was in the room at the time. her excuse was a shrug, and an indication it gave her some jollies. people are weird.	78	51954	bniexw	en6c19u

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	finally, some shit i can answer so last spring, i was doing snow day outings as a counselor on an outdoor resort. someone thought it would be a great idea to send 7 year olds to a sleepover outing that week, and i can attest that it was the worst fucking idea anyone has had in the last 2 years. first off, breakfast is served at 8am, so i usually wake the kids up at 7 45 so they can get dressed. not that group. no, that group decided they should wake up at 5 30 am and play hide and seek (and hide under my bed, pulling my sheets for additional cover). ''but random guy on reddit, what does any of that have to do with shitting on the floor??'' you ask. im getting to it so, as im trying to ignore the hide and seek and lie to myself thinking i'll just go back to sleep, i hear '' eeeeeeeeew raj (fictional name) peed in the trashcan!!!'' i get up (very begrudgingly) to go and confirm this event, and sure enough, the wastepaper basket was half full of pee. you see, our poor raj was suspected (yet still undiagnosed) to suffer from autism, and had trouble with social behaviors and how to act with others. he explained that while playing hide and seek, he was confronted with a choice either leave his hiding spot and go to the washroom, or stay hidden, pee in the adjacent trash can, and maybe win. and raj ain't no fucking loser.	64	51954	bniexw	en6eqiw

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we had a group of 3 vending machines right near the gym in case visitors wanted a snack and we didn't have a snack table set up, but mostly we would walk over there to take a break to talk or whatever and grab a couple snacks for class. my buddy dropped a deuce next to it because his special talent was pooping in random places, or as he called himself a pirp. that was his freshman year. senior year rolls around and they wanted to do a senior prank related to that. he went to the stalls in the gym bathroom and removed the dividers and brought them out and set them on the ground in front of the vending machines. he then printed a picture of poop out and taped it to the ground and had some whitty caption to go with it.	24	51954	bniexw	en6c807

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	classmates paid the local class idiot to poop in the laptop of the class administrator. i hated the idiot, but hated the administrator more so i chipped in. he slipped into his office as a bunch of kids pretended to start a fight that he needed to intervene in. he took the laptop, opened it like a book and held it under his ass and dropped the bomb. **then he closed it up with the turd in it.** to this day i have hysterical laughing fits at the idea of that shit getting squeezed between the keys. no loud or otherwise angry reaction though. he just locked his office knowing he can't let the kids see him because that's what they wanted. but we knew better, and that was good enough.	41	51954	bniexw	en6gi33

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	"this used to happen at my highschool (i didn't personally do it). it was pretty funny until you stepped in it. on top of this, they - rub their ass on a fork and put it back into dispensers, take a tiny piece of crap and pass it around the class calling it a ""scratch 'n' sniff"" (i have images of one we made in class, a fake one made out of melted m&ms in chemistry. this one i was a part of but its whatever. we added toilet paper to it and it looked so real and disgusting, but smelled awfully good. the other scratch and sniffs were sadly real). shit in the urinals and the sinks break the sinks off the walls, amongst other things. moon people in class (theyve mooned the teachers before), flash their balls to the girls, and surprisingly never got in trouble. say all sorts of things that realistically should lend suspension. most of these happen in my chem class when applicable. my teacher is so damn oblivious, but i think he's really going for retirement soon, probably because of us. and its really surprising that this happens considering its one of the most top-rated high schools."	127	51954	bniexw	en67588

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	im a little late to the party. here goes. i was in army cadets, and one year i went to a summer camp. it was a 6-week course held in some military base up north. a feud developed between two units, and things were escalating. they damaged our barracks hot water heaters, and now out building had nothing but cold showers. we had to hit back hard. i volunteered for the mission. the plan was simple. we cadets did laundry all the damn time. washers and dryers were installed in every barrack. i was to shit in the dryer, turn it on, and run. a dirty-bomb, you might say. i did my job. i stuck my ass in that commercial dryer and dropped a log on some guys t-shirts and set it to high.	42	51954	bniexw	en6h6dw

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	i was feeling really really really awful and i happen to be going at both ends. literally on my way walking out of the building, i got a kick in my stomach telling me i had to throw up right now. so i go to the bathroom and throw up and realize hey! i also need to shit! so i consider my options: i can throw up on the floor and shit in the toilet, or shit on the floor and throw up in the toilet. now i have some serious issues related to pooping and im actually quite used to cleaning up shit off the floor, and i know its going to be in more of a piece than vomit, so i chose the latter. five minuets and im done so i do my best to clean up after myself, write a note that says im really sorry i wasnt feeling well and stick it too the empty toilet paper roll (i cleaned up with some paper towels i got) so only they will see it and leave as fast as i can. still feel absolutely horrible about doing it. ive known a person who did it out of anti-establishment reasons, but its not like theyre super there in the head. i tried telling them they were only hurting the custodians and they insisted the head of our school district would hear about it and resign for it because it would make him realize how shitty (get it) of a person he was. he did resign, but for other reasons, three years later. she thought it was because of her and was sent to the hospital a month later because she told her mom that the district head who stepped down was coming after her in the form of a fly, and that he built a machine to turn himself into said fly and that she has him captured but she doesnt want to kill him because shell be arrested for murder. shes on medicine now and doing much better, if youre wondering.	16	51954	bniexw	en6gc7k

people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	hahaha wasn't me and wasn't on the bathroom floor, but when i was in middle school, we had weird kids and weird bathrooms. there was an area with a large rounded sink for several people to use at once and no doors-- you would just walk into either the women's or men's (kind of hard to explain.) the school must've thought these security measures were enough for the bathroom so there were no security cameras anywhere. well, that changed one day when some kid took a dump in one of the sinks. ha. for a whole month, that bathroom was blocked off and we had an assembly discussing school rules. when the bathroom finally opened, the kid took another dump in the sink *the day it opened.* the bathroom was closed off again and they had security cameras installed around every bathroom. the kid was never caught though, hahaha.	14	51954	bniexw	en6e38x
people who pooped on the bathroom floor in highschool, why?	we have a serial pooper at my work (costco). i'm talking clogged toilets and actual full sized turd down an aisle. went over the camera footage and this person knew exactly where to take a massive dump where it cut out of camera view. going through the footage we saw a woman run over it with her shopping cart, smearing it a ways down before she ditched her cart. i've narrowed it down to 3 regular shoppers and one of our staff. i'm not even sure how to bring it up to them if they're indeed the serial pooper.	13	51954	bniexw	en6ov9b

depressed, suicidal, or otherwise extremely downtrodden members of reddit: what is your go-to quote, phrase, or particular memory in life that keeps you going?	my mother's scream. this low, ungodly wail without tears, like a mortal wound, when she found out that my younger sister had died in a car accident. i'll remember that sound for the rest of my life, and the way she raced at me, grabbed my face in both of her hands, and wail-screamed, 'this wasn't your fault' before falling to pieces. it's been six years. my family is closer than ever but none of us have recovered from the loss. whenever things get overwhelming, i just think of that wail and realize that no matter how bad it gets, i will never be the one to cause that sound. edit: i came back to so much love and so many heartbreaking and heartwarming messages of solidarity and kindness and empathy and i cannot thank you all enough for not only sharing your stories. thank you all so much. and, as there was talk of it, the tl;dr of the story was that my sister was troubled. we were closer than she'd been to anyone, but she found a guy she really liked and she got into drugs and wound up stealing percocet from me after a surgery i'd had. she was subsequently kicked out of the house because i pushed for it (she was 21, and she'd drained my parents of over 10k over the course of a year; they didn't know about the drugs until i told them) and she left to find her way with her drug-dealer boyfriend in alberta. she got sick out there. i refused to talk to her; i felt betrayed. you always feel like you'll have more time. but within 3 months she fell asleep at the wheel of a car and met a van head-on. i know, logically, that it's not my fault, but my mother knew how i felt responsible for the fallout. four years of therapy, and we're all doing much better than we were. but please, if you need help, call one of the hotlines listed in the pinned comment of this thread. you're worth it.	14995	47057	bv51tj	epmlt6v

"the 18 yo me abandoned my abusive, narcissistic family with a single packed bag and $500 to my name. she made some good choices, some dumb choices. she showed up to her college classes everyday. she found a job working graveyard at a gas station just after 9/11 when racism was rampant and socially acceptable. she got hit by a van and that complicated showing up to work and when finances slipped, she was homeless for a time. but she still found a way to survive and keep going to school and hold down a job. because somewhere in her heart she knew that whatever situations she would get herself in as a newly minted adult would never be worse than the situation she had left behind. i'm 35 now and still dealing with depression on again and off again after plenty of therapy. self care takes so much of my energy. a few years ago i worked with a woman who was 84. she was an artist hired to do a project and had basically lived a life of great success (name withheld) and could take projects on selectively. we were talking about politics and then our lives. she too had up and left at a very young age to make a better life for herself. she told me to remember that 18 year old young woman in my darkest moments. to hold onto her and never lose her because she has enough courage in her heart to get me through anything. ""don't forget her,"" she said. ""you must never forget that part of you that is willing to fight for a better life."" i will never forget this woman or her advice."	530	47057	bv51tj	epmnp1y

depressed, suicidal, or otherwise extremely downtrodden members of reddit: what is your go-to quote, phrase, or particular memory in life that keeps you going?	for me its two things. first is my children and when that doesnt work (which can happen if im swinging hard and the mania is egging the depression on) its the thought that you can achieve even late in life. im 41 at the moment and had a good youth relatively speaking. dragged myself to where i want to be, studied to make up for dropping out of university in the 3rd year when i had my first proper breakdown. then i got settled and discovered thats the worst thing when youre driven. you get soft. you have no purpose. we were never rich but werent starving, had a wife, had kids, got soft. then the bad started getting hold again. stopped exercising , stopped eating right, got lazy which is just what it needs to take hold. i just think of people who started late. ray kroc started mcdonalds as we know it till he was 52. hed had ups and downs but he never stopped grinding. darwin didnt publish the origin of species till he was 50 and lots shot him down at the time. i see stories of people running marathons and publishing books in their 90s never too late. your first painting is going to suck your first book is going to suck your first run might only be half a mile the first pancake always looks bad like bob ross says talent is just a pursued interest. anything youre willing to practice you can do.	36	47057	bv51tj	epmdipb

"not really uplifting but you asked for what keeps me going so. a few years ago i got my emt basic certification. the school i went through was a small family owned thing run by retired emts and firefighters. on the last day after we all passed the final test, we got the offer to stick around to watch a 'worst of' slideshow of calls the instructors or people they knew had personally responded to. sort of a ""this is what you're in for"" kind of thing. the one that stuck with me was a teenager who attempted to shoot himself in the head with a shotgun. he had waited for his parents to leave, locked himself in his room, put down a tarp for the mess and even put the note in a plastic baggie. unfortunately, when he put the barrel under his chin he aimed in such a way that the pellets missed or grazed his skull, and just destroyed his face instead. the house was just down the street from the local fire station so when a neighbor heard the gunshot and called 911 they were there and had the door open within minutes. the kids lower face was just a load of red paste, but he was still barely breathing on arrival so to quote my instructor ""we just saw the bubbles and shoved the tube down there"" he somehow remained conscious the entire time and was tracking everything with his remaining eye. (our class got the pictures to go with this story, they're online somewhere i'm sure but i do not recommend) he survived and a year later, more desperate to die than ever, attempted to od on pain pills he had been hoarding, but survived again.

"people who were adults during y2k, what was the most radical action someone you know did to prepare for the ""apocalypse?"""	i bought a good generator and stockpiled some gasoline, water and food. since i had two very young children, i didn't want to have to go to a shelter if there were any power disruptions. this was in the snowy north of the u.s. i did extensive research online, and i felt that there was enough reasonable doubt and concern to at least take what i felt were the minimal necessary precautions. - generator, i bought a 4000 w generac, with cast iron cylinder sleeve and overhead cam. it was expensive, but i didn't want a cheap one, with a lawnmower engine. i still own it, and it powers the furnace, fridge, microwave and lights when we lose power from storms. - gasoline, it was possible gas supplies could have been interrupted, so i purchased some plastic, 55 gallon barrels. i filled three with gasoline. i also had the 50 gallon tank in my boat filled, and all of my jerry jugs and portable boat gas tanks. all together, i had about 255 gallons of fuel. i estimated we could have had normal electricity for two months with this. in the end, it worked out ok, because gas prices went pretty high early in 2000, so i liked using up my cheap gas over a few months. - water, i had two, 55 gallon plastic barrels filled with water, preserved with the required drops of bleach. - food, we had a modest supply of food. we had a couple shelving units with dried and canned foods. nothing crazy. it was stuff we normally ate, so we used it all up eventually. - misc., i had rechargable batteries, candles, etc., all of the usual storm prep items too. overall, i feel i had adequate preparation, without going overboard. i didn't buy a shotgun, for example. i felt the prep was worth it, even if the risk was small, because i couldn't imagine how bad it would be to have to live in a shelter with an infant and a toddler. the only real expense was the barrels, which i got rid of. the generator was a great investment.	12	23318	bnlib2	en80e13

"my ex mother-in-law was living with her college professor, who had recently saved up some money to redo his bathroom. she convinced him that the rollback to 000 would indeed bring about the apocalypse and usher in unimaginable mayhem. he subsequently took the money he had saved for the bathroom refurbish and instead stockpiled food, water, supplies and, of course, a few guns. then they boarded up the windows and waited. ""mother"" was a bit touched in the head and mooched off this poor sap while collecting ssi from the gov't. that really irked me, so i bought her a cooler cup in the days leading up to new year's day that read: ""y2k - let's party"". needless to say, she didn't find it funny and told me i'd be sorry. in a way she was right; i wholly regretted marrying into that hills have eyes of a family. my wife and i divorced shortly thereafter. that's when the party really began."	26	23318	bnlib2	en7hd6j

what is the greatest comeback to an insult youve ever heard?	7th grade. i basically had no friends except for this girl named carla, who was this completely asinine pompous bitch, proud of her evil and tyrannical attitude. there was a substitute teacher who couldnt give any less of a fuck with what was going on in the class. everyone was talking, being middle schoolers, until carla and i started arguing. then the entire class shut up to listen in, even the sub. i dont remember what the argument was about, but what i do remember is her saying to me, i could think of a thousand things wrong with you. and the hot, black sheep bad boy of the school spoke up from the corner of his class saying, you know whats really sad carla is that you can think of a thousand things wrong with everything here, but not one thing wrong with yourself. pretty sure i blushed for at least a full minute and a half.	106	40285	brayzq	eodd419

what's something everyone needs to be reminded?	1. that when you spread hope to others, you give hope to yourself in the end. 2. being responsible does not mean being miserable, but it does mean that you are aware of what the consequences might be and accept them. 3. that being genuine with people is something everyone will appreciate and help you realize who you are. this does not mean being an a-hole in what you say, but speaking truthfully from your perspective in an amicable manner. 4. that pursuing truth comes at the price of what you thought was true (what you are comfortable with). 5. that being kind does not mean putting up with people who are cruel. it is politely reminding people of how flawed we are all and thus demands gentleness in judgement. 6. that being a human being means you are subject to change and should try to adapt to it as you live. 7. being a good person does not entail being entirely kind but knowing when to be stern and when to be gentle. 8. that by actively trying to improve yourself, you inevitably help change those who love you to be better. 9. youth should be enjoyed but should not be relied on for continued enjoyment. passions and love changes its form over time to help you pursue the best things in life as a whole not a specific part/time period of it. 10. be truthful to anyone and everyone as much as you can be. bonus: humility is the greatest indicator of individual ability as well as character. &#x200b; edit: my goodness! my first reddit gold! i am very thankful! thank you ever so much kind stranger! new edit: my good gracious! two more gold and one silver! i'm so happy that you guys loved my little list. have a great day!	664	41212	bmjk7w	emxdu99

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"i run the front desk at a hotel and they are an absolute nightmare. they also straight up lie to the guests and to the hotels constantly. truly one of the most shady companies i've ever dealt with. they purposely try and deceive people who don't know any better into thinking that they are dealing with the hotel directly. they create adds in such a way that when people google the hotel's phone number, a number to expedia comes up, and if the customer asks if the are speaking directly with the hotel front desk they will say yes. there have been countless times where guests have called to cancel their reservation that was booked through expedia. i inform them that they will have to contact expedia directly, since they pre-paid through them, but that it will be no issue because the hotel does not charge a penalty fee for cancellation. an expedia representative will call the hotel with the guest on hold and ask about getting it cancelled. i tell them it's no problem. they ask if we will be charging a penalty fee, and i tell them no. all is right and good, right? nope. i then get a call back from the guest who is upset, saying that the expedia representative told them they could not be refunded because of the fee charged by the hotels cancellation policy. taking the guests money and blaming it on the hotel, and keeping all of the profit. this has happened countless times. i once had a guest while at the front desk call about cancelling 3 days out of a multiple day reservation, as she had to leave earlier than expected. they pulled the same bullshit with her, not knowing that she was at the front desk. after me telling the representative that the cancellation is fine and we will not be charging any penalties, they get back on the phone with her and blatantly lie. i asked her to hand her phone to me and that was quite a surprise for the representative. who said that ""there must have been a misunderstanding""."	966	50935	boxktx	ennjoid
"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	used to be a health inspector. in my first year a lot of my old favorite restaurants were ruined for me, but none so bad as the discount sushi place my college bestie and i used to frequent. they had roaches bad. in my time at the health department i never saw them worse than in that kitchen. we got calls about the roaches at least twice a month, and every time we went they were back with a vengeance. they were closed for them multiple times, but just never kept up with the pest control and cleaning necessary to get rid of them. they were also dying tilapia red and selling it as red snapper on their menu. this is pretty common around here, but it's super illegal because it's literal false advertising. fun fact: some people are allergic to tilapia. not sure i want to be around when that restaurant owner finds that out. they had hundreds of cardboard boxes stacked outside their back door, plus a bunch of old equipment they weren't using. this added to the roach problem and any day it could turn into a rodent problem. one time i drive by and they had animal cages back there, too. i don't wanna know that story. add to that: i'm pretty sure the employees are all indentured servants or victims of human trafficking. they all show up in the same beat up white van every day and work a 12+ hour shift. the owner is unkind to them and they don't respect him. he says he can trust them to do their jobs, but was sketchy when we said to fire them and hire employees who will. we never had proof, but it was always upsetting and struck me as off. he tried to bribe me and my coworkers multiple times, too. i'm not a health inspector anymore but he still tries to give me free food or money when he sees me. he opened a new restaurant and i didn't know it was his, so and friend and i went to go check it out. i was told that appetisers were free for me only. then i saw him in the back. we had to leave. never again. it's too sketchy and too likely to get me sick.	2555	50935	boxktx	ennuhr3

"comcast. a door-to-door salesman straight up lied to my dad, saying they had a four-dvr setup that would cost less than what we were paying at&t. when the installation guy got there, he said that no, they didn't have a four-dvr setup, he was told to give us the standard two-dvr setup. which was absolutely not something that would work in a house with six people with wildly different tastes in tv shows. so my dad tells him never mind, we're sticking with at&t then, but because the comcast guy had already installed our new cable box, he couldn't take it back with him, so we had to mail it back to comcast ourselves. the kicker is, five years later comcast tried to bill my parents for the cable box, saying we never sent it back. my parents insisted they did, and comcast wanted the ups receipt, which obviously we no longer had because it was five years ago and we hadn't heard anything from them before this. so my parents refused to pay, comcast sent a collections company after us, and when my parents explained the situation to the collection company, they were like ""those fuckers, we'll take care of this."" that was, thankfully, the end of it."	14449	50935	boxktx	enn7kiv

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	(warning, disgusting story ahead) i went to dickeys barbecue pit, their food isn't amazing but i was craving southern food and my suburban town in california doesn't have many options. so me and my girlfriend buy some sandwiches and have them for dinner, they're cold and taste like salty sweat. the next day i have uncontrollably shitting liquid shit and vomiting multiple times an hour. if i was alone i would have gone to the emergency room but my dads a nurse and was there. i vomited something like 20 times in the whole day and kept dry heaving afterwards. the diarrhea came so fast and uncontrolled that it ruined multiple pairs of underwear and a rug that was by the toilet (why my dad has rugs in the bathroom i don't know but i shit on it when bent over the toilet). it took only a day for me to feel better and i was already eating heavy foods again, but lo and behold guess who comes over to see me well again and shits herself in my bathroom? my girlfriend, the only other person who ate at dickeys. so i spent the rest of the day, after having just shit and vomited myself to death, helping my girlfriend when she was shitting and vomiting. i think we're closer to each other after that experience. tl;dr: ate at dickeys barbecue pit, shitted and vomited ruining clothes and a rug. gf came over and shit and vomited too.	1668	50935	boxktx	ennue2n

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	a hospital in my area. my brother and his wife just recently had a baby there. my first nephew and their first child. he was born two weeks premature by scheduled c-section, but you couldnt tell since he was more than 9 pounds when he came out. if he went full term he could have been more than 11 pounds. anyways, he arrives and everything is going well, his blood sugar was a little low, but the doctors claimed it got better. a day later and he begins twitching every once in a while. my sister in law asks the pediatrician and the nurse why and they said that it was fine. the day after that and the twitching increased and he began doing it every other minute. my brother and his wife panic and ask the doctor but the doctor checks his blood quickly and says nothing is wrong but if theyre still worried about it they should wait to go to the pediatrician on monday (3 days later). as soon as they leave the hospital despite the baby still twitching they turn around and ask for the doctor to please look one more time. he refuses and tells them that they cant look anymore because they are discharged from the hospital. refusing to believe that their baby was okay, my brother and his wife took him to a different hospitals emergency room. the doctor there took one look at the babys blood and immediately prepared a bottle of formula for him. his blood sugar was 36. if you arent familiar with blood sugar then just know that sugar that low can be deadly. my sister in laws milk hasnt come in yet, she didnt know that, and the pediatrician at the first hospital only gave the baby 2 ounces of formula in 2 days. he baby was very close to going into shock. if they took the doctors advice and waited until monday that baby would have been dead before reaching home. edit: my sister in law was checked many times for gestational diabetes and she didnt have it at any point. the hospital is in pennsylvania but i wont name which one at least until my brother and sister in law decide to sue or not. i and most of my family agree that they should sue but theyre much more focused on their new baby at the moment. the baby is fine now and getting fed plenty at home with a mixture of both breast milk and formula.	2884	50935	boxktx	enniwni

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"cancun, a little mexican restaurant in my area. they had a bunch of tacos on their menu, all of which listed cheese and white sauce as ingredients. the fish tacos didn't, so i ordered them and didn't bother specifying that i didn't want cheese or white sauce. well, they came out smothered in both and i couldn't eat them, so i sent them back. the waiter came out and made a huge show of interrogating my husband about why ""she"" (meaning me, sitting right there across the fucking table, fully capable of speaking for myself) sent back the food, and told my husband that it wasn't the restaurant's fault that ""she"" didn't just assume that the tacos would obviously come covered in ingredients the menu didn't mention. when i said that he should be talking to me, the one with the problem, he said that he was only comfortable talking with ""the one who would be paying the bill."" i asked to speak to the manager, and as he was leaving to get him, i very clearly heard him call me a bitch on his way out. the manager backed up his sexist prick of a server, so we left without paying, have never gone back, and have told others not to go. fuck that place.

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	the *daily mail*. i live near liverpool in the uk, where the *sun* is considered literally the worst thing ever -- for real, there are signs up just randomly in the street boycotting it, and most newsagents don't stock it -- but the *mail* has it beat for me. it's an absolute rag that spits on any idea of journalistic integrity, that constantly strips any nuance out of public discussion and that is packed to the rafters with scare stories and hypocritical bullshit. of [the five publications that received the most ipso complaints in 2017](https://www.ipso.co.uk/news-press-releases/press-releases/press-watchdog-received-a-record-breaking-amount-of-complaints-and-enquiries-in-2017/), four of them -- the *daily mail*, *mail online*, the *mail on sunday* and [*metro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro_(british_newspaper\)), the free paper that you'll find given out everywhere in the uk -- were run by the mail group. (first place was the *sun*, just about, but it was dwarfed by the combined figures for the other four.) occasionally a newsagent will do an offer where you can buy the *mail* for 50p or so and get a bottle of water or a chocolate bar worth a pound for free, which leads to the ever-present quandary of whether or not i buy the paper and hope that they lose money on it, or pay full price for the water or chocolate just so i don't push their circulation numbers up. i'd say it's an irrational hatred, but i don't even think it is. they're an organisation that i genuinely believe makes the world worse just by existing.	3653	50935	boxktx	enm6e1r

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	spirit airlines, at some point i expect them to start charging you for oxygen in order to breathe on their flights. the amount of money you save isn't worth the minimalist flight experience you get. other airlines might be at the slighest bit more expensive for a flight, but say with southwest you get free bags, united you get free tv/movies to watch, and so on which overall makes the travel day more enjoyable in the grand scheme of things. spirit is like flying in a hollowed out tin can in the sky. ps: i get it, some people dont care about in flight experiences and just want to get somewhere by plane.	3075	50935	boxktx	enm5dkf
"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	i've told this before, but i'll do it again for shits and giggles. i will never eat at arby's again. once upon a time, at a treasure coast florida arby's, i decide i'm hungry and snag myself a nice, messy arby-q sandwich. every time i ate them, i always lamented how they'd be better with a slightly toasted bun. well, i make my order, pay, sit down and take a bite. my fervorous hunger is rewarded by a resounding crunch! they toasted my bun! while still chewing, i pull my burger away and look it over. there is not a slight bit of tanning in bun and now that i hold it and analyze it, it doesn't feel remotely stiff like a toasted bun would. as i sat there, food still in my mouth, a wave of horror came over me and prompted me to open uncap the bun. i saw the largest [palmetto bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florida_woods_cockroach) i'd seen in quite some time. or half of it at least. now, i'm a good person, at least i feel i can be more often than not. but at that moment of mind-fuckery mixed in with a serving of disgust and a side of 'why me?', i snapped. i rushed towards the cashier stations and winged the burger at the closest wall/barrier i could see, spat the food all over their floors and cussed them up one side and down the other. i've not set foot in an arby's since then and i now have a vicious hatred for any kind of 'wet bread' texture that has ruined quite a few meal types for me (i can't even dunk fucking cookies in milk!!!) never again.	590	50935	boxktx	enmyqq2
"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	midas. i got a coupon for a $20 oil change, tire rotation, and inspection from the grocery store, so i decided to go and use it before taking a road trip. a few weeks after the oil change and everything, i started to notice a wet spot in my parking space when my car wasn't there, and it kept growing, and never drying. i took my car into the dealership because it was still under its limited warranty, and yep, it was an oil leak, whoever changed my oil at midas had stripped the plug. dealership patched it for free, and it held for a while, but years later i needed to shell out for a new oil pan, and it was a costly repair. served me right for cheating on the trusted family-owned shop next door that's never fucked me over. the one time they made a mistake, they owned up to it and made it right, for free, as soon as they could. oh, and the one time i went to valvoline, the guy went off on me for having a fucked up oil plug, so that's made me not want to go there again, even though i probably should give them another shot because their hours are really good and they didn't actually cause any damage.	372	50935	boxktx	enmd97z
"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	"tony's pizza palace (edmonton, alberta, canada). september 26, 1986 was the day i buried my infant son. he was 11 months old and died from complications due to being born 3 months premature (his twin brother is healthy and got married 3.5 years ago). after returning from the burial ceremony to the funeral home we went out to our cars and found fliers tucked under the windshield wipers: ""having a family get-together? why not have it at tony's pizza palace? ask about our group discounts"" **edit:** i thought i should add this. tony's happens to be one block away from the funeral home, three blocks from the second biggest hospital and about ten blocks away from the second biggest shopping mall in the city; all of which are in a straight line. i figure some 17 year old kid, working part time for tony's was given a pile of fliers and asked to put them on cars at the mall. the kid, not thinking, saw all the cars and probably started at the funeral home, then went to the hospital parking lots and was probably out of fliers before he even got to the mall. i seriously doubt anyone in management (or perhaps i hope that nobody) at tony's was aware that this happened. but it happened on a day that i won't forget and i still haven't gotten past it."	14449	50935	boxktx	enm9q2u

"what is your ""never again"" brand, store, restaurant, or company?"	craftsman. when i was starting out as a mechanic i had a set store brand tools i got from checker auto parts. they were nice, had a lifetime warranty, but were just chrome vanadium, they are not pro tools. when they eventually started breaking i thought i'd go a step up to america's most trusted name in tools, craftsman. i started getting them one at a time as i needed them, plus a set of something new here and there. fast forward a couple years and i still have a large portion of my checker brand tools mixed with my newer craftsman when low and behold the craftsman tools start breaking too. i warrantied them of course but when i suddenly realized i was on my 5th 1/2 socket i decided i needed to start thinking about one of the pro tool manufacturers. i eventually started getting snap on, a choice i don't regret because i have never had to warranty a single snap on socket or wrench i've ever bought, but they are expensive as fuck. i eventually changed careers so i no longer go through tools like before, but i will still never buy a single craftsman tool ever again. i won't buy snap on either, instead i'll probably go with husky from home depot, or the autozone or o'reilly's store brands. they're cheaper, but still a better tool than craftsman.	1352	50935	boxktx	enm4t21

what's something you can't unsee once someone points it out?	i once listened to a podcast where they explained the sound from these high budget nature documentaries is implied to be but not actually diegetic. as in, the sound isn't actually the sound that the animals etc are making. that sound is added in post. all those rustling trees and vocalisations are recorded before or after or might even be from animals in captivity, and are put onto the scene. part of this makes sense. you can't record sound with clarity underwater, and you couldn't hear anything in these long shots in real life. once you know this, you will definitely notice. are those animals vocalising too often? why is that tree making so much noise? how did they decide what sound this fish was going to make when it moves? you realise this is as much a constructed experience as any other film.	59	21399	bqx0lw	eo9rgqu

"i was 15(f), and my then-friend-who-i-also-dated-for-a-bit (15m) said two things on two separate occasions. 1. we had just finished a lesson at school, and in the excitement of being free i did a spin, arms out, with this huge smile on my face. ""don't do that, it makes you look really unattractive."" 2. talking about what we liked to do on weekends. i talked about how my family and i loved to go on long hikes in the country. ""oh? then why are you so fat?"" at the time i was a little overweight, but not huge. it crushed me on both occasions. being a teenage girl is hard enough without having a twat for a friend. i'm 29 now so i have the benefit of hindsight but he was vile sometimes. &#x200b; edit: thank you, everyone. i'm keeping every message below for when i'm having a shit day haha. as far as i'm aware he's now a responsible adult. we didn't really stay in touch."	4740	43428	bq7pbb	eo2bxfw

what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"i am probably too late to this, but just in case it helps someone, whenever i suffer from my ""depression phase"" i read the following which someone said on reddit and has always stayed with me. i have literally copied it and pasted it in my google notes and it gives me immense hope to stay alive. &#x200b; >"" i've survived (so far) and a lot of people i've known and loved did not. i've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. i have no children, and i can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. but here's my two cents. i wish i could say you get used to people dying. i never did. i don't want to. it tears a hole through me whenever somebody i love dies, no matter the circumstances. but i don't want it to ""not matter"". i don't want it to be something that just passes. my scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that i had for and with that person. and if the scar is deep, so was the love. so be it. scars are a testament to life. scars are a testament that i can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that i can heal and continue to live and continue to love. and the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. scars are a testament to life. scars are only ugly to people who can't see. as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. when the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. and all you can do is float. you find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. maybe it's some physical thing. maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. maybe it's a person who is also floating. for a while, all you can do is float. stay alive. in the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. they come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. all you can do is hang on and float. after a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. when they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. but in between, you can breathe, you can function. you never know what's going to trigger the grief. it might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. it can be just about anything.and the wave comes crashing. but in between waves, there is life. somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. or 50 feet tall. and while they still come, they come further apart. you can see them coming. an anniversary, a birthday, or christmas, or landing at o'hare. you can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. and when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. take it from an old guy. the waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. but you learn that you'll survive them. and other waves will come. and you'll survive them too. if you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. and lots of shipwrecks.

"i was waiting at a bus stop to go home one night and this homeless man walks up and sits next to me. he starts chatting with me and being in seattle there was a good 15/10 chance this guy wanted something from me. he talked with a bit of a slur but i believe that was actually just how he talked and not due to any drugs/alcohol. he chatted with me for a good hour while i waited for the bus and was actually a very interesting guy. told me all about life as a homeless in seattle and how he ended up that way. man spoke some genuine wisdom but he also let his spit fly with every other syllable. when my bus finally came he gave me a fist bump and said ""i haven't had the chance to talk with anybody in a long time. thanks for giving me a chance brother, ***i spit but i love"".*** and that phrase right there ""i spit but i love"" i took to heart for some reason. really changed my perspective on homeless. they're not all these doped up creatures or some non-homeless jackass trying to make a quick buck off honest people. some really are just the people down on there luck that are probably pretty lonely because people avoid them like the plaque. he didn't ask for anything when he left either but if he had i probably would have givin' him a few bucks."	75	43428	bq7pbb	eo2x9dj

what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	i grew up in a small village, didn't have many toys cause of economical reasons and didn't move much idk why. later, when i was 7, visiting big city with parents, went to attraction with darts shooting at balloons. i started enjoyed it until moment when woman who was organizer there, spoke loudly how i am too weak, seeing how i threw darts toward target unsharply. that's when i felt myself physically disadvantagous and learned that words hurt, for the first time edit: wording	38	43428	bq7pbb	eo25iot
what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	"my aunt was one of the sweetest and most loving people i had ever met. she had a mental handicap and essentially spent her life with the mindset of a four year old girl. she couldn't do much on her own but loved stuffed animals, walking around target looking for new toys or music, just basically spending time with us. she developed breast cancer which at the time i thought was no big deal. i was certain with today's medicine they would just cut it out, give her some treatment and life would go back to normal. less than a year later she had been admitted to the e.r. several times because she just stopped breathing on her own and was constantly losing consciousness. the cancer had spread to her lungs and brain. about 1/3 of her brain matter on the ct scan was just a blob of cancer at that point. she always said she loved me a lot but the two things that hurt the most were her last words to me: ""big brother, help me. help me. help me."" she had always called me her little brother when i was growing up. but i guess at this point she knew i was the one taking care of her. hearing her call me her big brother and just asking over and over for me to help me was heartbreaking. it still hurts thinking about that."	40	43428	bq7pbb	eo2p9gb
what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	any us marine who reads this might call me a boot/mortard but heres my story. im in the dep for the marines and i go to boot camp in a few weeks. a few months ago me and my dad went to visit washington dc. while we were there we went to the national museum of the marine corps. my dad mentioned to the tour guide that im going to boot camp soon and so he kind of took me and my dad to the side and gave us our own little personal tour. one of the exhibits had the actual flag that was raised over iwo jima in wwii. the tour guide started explaining to me how much that flag means to the corps, and told me soon ill be able to say thats my flag. as if that wasnt powerful enough already he then told me to turn around to see the memorial wall. they had an entire wall filled with 6,800 eagle globe and anchors. one for each marine who died at iwo jima. when i got home i told that story to my recruiter and he said remember those eagle globe and anchors while your earning yours and that really hit me.	38	43428	bq7pbb	eo2q2lw

what is something someone said to you that hit you the hardest?	at my last job i had a team of about 20 people under me. i honestly did everything for them. if someone was sick i would cover for them. if someone messer up, nothing would reach the superiors but we would work it out. we worked in social work, with time contracts, so at one point it was clear that all of us (me too!) were leaving. i could argue with my own bosses for as many people to be kept in the company as possible, probably 5 or so of them. for the rest i made sure they had excellent recommendations, hell i even emailed them fitting job offers in the area. i had to leave as well. then i read them bitching about me on facebook. saying hurtful things about me that werent even true. i called them out right then and there. one employee just wrote something like its true, bitch!, nobody else stepped in to say it wasnt. i just blocked them all and threw away the wedding invitations i already had for them. still makes me sad when i think about it.	68	43428	bq7pbb	eo2s9yh

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"i appreciate atheists' willingness to ask questions and work through the things that challenge them about faith. i'm a believer so obviously we don't come to the same conclusions, but i think too many of my brothers and sisters bury the stuff about their faith that they struggle with. that can both hurt their walk and make them come off as sanctimonious. i say that because that was me, once upon a time. some days, it still is. it's a work in progress. matthew 7:7 says ""ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."" too often believers don't want to ask tough questions, but i think it's important to do so. if the christian god is who he claims to be, i have to imagine he can handle honest questions from someone seeking to understand."	5018	48707	bn3ab7	en1xrux
atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	christian here. i really admire the fact that many athiests try to do good things for the community (like service projects, volunteerism, fundraisers) because they truly care and want to be a good person all on there own. to clarify further, many christians are also like this, but i feel a good majority are like this because their church told them they should do it because it pleases god, or they want to go to heaven, or their small group was doing it and they want to fit in. granted some athiests do good things to pat themselves on their back via social media, but many others do it because they feel its the right thing to do snd aren't trying to benefit themselves in some way. thats the sign of a truly good person.	2808	48707	bn3ab7	en29kjy
atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	funeral rites. some religions have elaborate death/ funeral rites that last for about a month, followed by a prayer to mark the first year of death. close family, as well as members of the community are required to attend these. this results in a situation where the grieving family is constantly surrounded for at least a month before they can resume their normal life. i personally would rather have something like this, than have 1 memorial service and then be immediately be left alone.	588	48707	bn3ab7	en1xbty

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	as an atheist, i admire that religion can provide a source of strength, community, and hope for people. through religion, people find the courage and hope to continue a mundane or excessively taxing existence. people also develop life-long friendships and support communities through church groups and other religious organizations. i believe these aspects are important to have in one's life. if religion can provide that for some people, then i think that's a great thing. edit: thanks for the coins you wonderful people. whether youre religious or atheist, i hope you all have a wonderful day.	14494	48707	bn3ab7	en20769

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i don't know if this has already been stated but this is something to admire about atheists. >[why did god create atheists?](https://randysrandom.com/god-create-atheists/) there is a famous story told in chassidic literature that addresses this very question. the master teaches the student that god created everything in the world to be appreciated, since everything is here to teach us a lesson. one clever student asks what lesson can we learn from atheists? why did god create them? the master responds god created atheists to teach us the most important lesson of them all  the lesson of true compassion. you see, when an atheist performs an act of charity, visits someone who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is not doing so because of some religious teaching. he does not believe that god commanded him to perform this act. in fact, he does not believe in god at all, so his acts are based on an inner sense of morality. and look at the kindness he can bestow upon others simply because he feels it to be right. this means, the master continued that when someone reaches out to you for help, you should never say i pray that god will help you. instead for the moment, you should become an atheist, imagine that there is no god who can help, and say i will help you. martin buber, tales of hasidim vol. 2 (1991)	288	48707	bn3ab7	en35s2h

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"it's a little difficult to explain and i am sure people on both sides will roll their eyes at me.but prayer. just not in the way most people think of prayer. hear me out. when someone you love is going through a hard time, sometimes there is literally nothing you can do. some problems can't be helped by outside people. for whatever reason. that happens. and it really fucking sucks. it really fucking sucks watching someone you care about suffer. at the same time, it really fucking sucks watching your loved ones worry about *you* if you're the one who is suffering and can't be helped. i hate it so fucking much watching someone i care about struggle and i can't do shit. i hate it so much when someone i care about wants to help me and they can't. i worry about them and feel like shit i can't do anything. or i am having to watch them worry about me since there isn't anything they can do. the phrase, ""sending my love."" or ""sending warm thoughts your way."" accomplishes so little. but sometimes when you feel so helpless that's all you can say. that's all you can do. and then come in religious people who have ""the power of prayer."" even though as an atheist.i feel that ""sending you my love."" accomplishes the same thing as ""you're in my prayers."" i'm still a little jealous of that ability.of ""prayer."" when someone i care about genuinely says, ""i'll pray for you."" to me.i do get some comfort. yeah, i don't think it will solve my problems.but i believe *they believe* that it will. the person i care about will worry about me a little less. and i take comfort in that. i do also feel loved when someone says, ""i'm sending you warm thoughts."" to me, but having been in that position myself.i worry that they will be worrying over me. and there have been many times where someone i care about is religious and i wish i could say, ""i'll pray for you."" because i know that would mean a lot to them. i know they would get some comfort for that. but as an atheist.it would be a lie for me to say it. and then the words, ""i'm sending you warm thoughts."" feels so empty in comparison. i hope that makes sense. and obviously i mean it on an individual level. certainly not to a community tragedy. yeah. i don't think prayer actually solves a problem, but i can recognize the comfort it gives some people and sometimes i wish i could provide that too in times where there isn't anything else."	3384	48707	bn3ab7	en27br0

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i like how passionately many of the actively religious people speak of their faith. i ran into a guy so empowered by the sermon he experienced he gave everyone in the burger king i was in a hug and told them they were loved. seeing people be happy with whatever they're doing brings me a lot of joy and i find it super adorable. plus, having been at low points i'm aware of how much those words alone can bring somebody out of a funk. i also love the good many churches do. my old neighbourhood made sure everyone, even those who were not interested in jesus, had what they needed and made an effort to help people out where it was needed without judgement. i volunteered with them a couple times as an (open) atheist and they were just so welcoming. i know many, if not most, are like this and i wish it got the attention the negative often gets.	486	48707	bn3ab7	en24d80

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	"community. i'm essentially an atheist (ignostic really, but that's not a term people use), but i really admire the sense of community that religions offer. i think so many people in the us are lonely, and religion is a great way for people to have an ""extended community"" of people who have something in common. i love the religions that offer some kind of support system for people who need help (medical bills, losing jobs). i love that you often get to know people in your neighborhood who you might see on other days. it's really hard for an atheist to have the same thing. you can do meetups, but most aren't held on a weekly schedule if they're consistent at all. and you rarely meet people nearby. the lack of extended community is, imo, one of the reasons companies are able to harness that need and turn it into work. i despise companies that talk about being a family (that you lose when fired), and i'm cynical about team-building exercises and companies where everyone hangs out with each other on weekends. it leads to nasty cliques, people taking work too seriously, and people working hard because their whole life centers around it. silicon valley is full of companies taking advantage of people's need for interaction to place themselves at the center, but it benefits the company and builds a really fragile community. i work from home now and i'm really struggling to find this. everyone just goes home and disappears into their garages, and it's hard to find new friends and new communities at this age (mid 30s) while everyone is busy with work and kids. i've been to countries where everyone comes out at night, has a little bbq, and talks to each other. they walk around and play games with neighbors or just say hi. i really wish everyone did that here. i really wish our sense of community wasn't tied to religion, because i don't think it should have to be, and i really wish the american community wasn't a thing of the past."	64	48707	bn3ab7	en24u4r

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	religious person here. in fact, clergy person here. i find that the atheists i've talked to have thought long and hard about god and ethics. they make moral choices for their own sake, not from fear of punishment or anticipation of reward. that's what i admire. i do find that atheists tend to lump believers together. and to overestimate reward/punishment/afterlife as what drives believers. may i say that i find online atheists are less thoughtful than the ones i've talked to in person. but not in this thread.	62	48707	bn3ab7	en36b4g

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i grew out of islam in college, but i really admired the shared narrative and power of the ummah. islam is big on collective action and community. the ummah, or the community surround themselves with many principles based on kindness, charity and love of your fellow man. when i was deeply in the faith - it felt like i could ask for anything. we addressed each other as brothers and sisters. are you traveling? reach out to a local mosque they'll let you stay at their facility or find a community member that can find you a bed. need money, or are you sick? the mosque could allow you to present your case to the community during prayer. there one could ask for prayer or donations. daycare? therapist? food? go to the mosque. &#x200b; there was also the call to action. you were often encouraged to donate to the poor, volunteer or just be a good person. the community would self police negative behaviors, or intervene in family conflicts. it really was beautiful. but the thing i miss the most - the routines. lunch time prayer and evening prayer we go to the mosque. friday prayer meet at the mosque. ramadan, spend all night at the mosques praying. i can't accept the existence of an abrahamic god for reasons that wouldn't be productive to explain, or haven't been said before. that lack of faith makes attempts at participating in the community feel disingenuous. i'd feel like i'm tainting something pure by faking it. i really admire this though. this raise to a call and devote faith in something. the camaraderie around something bigger than yourself.	22	48707	bn3ab7	en3b0tf

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	there are a few things i admire about religion. first and foremost is the fellowship between members of a congregation. that's a thing i think people miss the most about quitting their church. often they will try something like unitarian universalists to try to recapture that. secondly, i think religious devotion has inspired some of the greatest art and architecture the world has ever seen. when i think of the world's most beautiful buildings, i think of places like notre dame, the blue mosque, the sistine chapel, angor wat, the white temple, or the simple unadorned but iconic white protestant country church with it's simple steeple. then there is the art like the last supper, the ceiling in the sistine chapel, the sculpture of christ the redeemer in rio. finally, i think religion, when at its best, encourages people to act selflessly. to donate to help strangers in need, to send food, clothing or money to those in need. one doesn't need religion to act selflessly. or morally. but if that encouragement is there, i think it's a good thing.	16	48707	bn3ab7	en25irl
atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	i'm a christian and i truly admire some atheists for their simple and effective moral codes. they do the right thing just because it *feels* right to them, not because theyr'e afraid of god's wrath. i think religious people can learn from that	15	48707	bn3ab7	en30wbj

atheists of reddit, what is one thing you admire about religion? religious people of reddit, what is one thing you admire about atheism?	regarding atheists, i would say this. while some people are dogmatic about it many are not. as an example, i am an american convert to hinduism. i have a friend who is actually somewhat prominent in atheist circles. during some difficult times, he has encouraged me in my faith in that he has seen the changes it has made in me, and seen the seriousness of my commitment. while he doesn't believe in my faith, he believes in my dedication. in fact, he more than once, during my time as a monk, made donations to help me go on pilgrimages to see my guru. many atheist i have known are like that. i have even found, provided you don't preach, you can share aspects of the philosophy and be heard and appreciated.	30	48707	bn3ab7	en2j1qj

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	4th year med student reporting in. had a rotation with a pediatrician where we ended up in the classic encounter with an anti-vaccination parent. this lady was a conspiracy theory magnet. she casually mentioned everything from 9/11 to chemtrails. of course she loved the idea of the vaccine conspiracy as well, opting to not protect her one year old to stick it to big pharma. i relayed all of this to my attending after my exam (i would see the patient first, gather history and do my exam to present to my attending physician). he got this sort of lazy smirk on his face that screamed watch this. we go back into the exam room and we cover all of the important bits of a well-child encounter. growth charts, behavioral milestones, nutrition, sleep. and then we get to vaccines. she lists approximately 15 reasons why vaccines are more dangerous than the disease they protect against (lol) in addition to the various evils of the pharmaceutical industry. my attending listens quietly until shes done with her soapbox (about one eternity later), and then interjects with: have you considered the possibility that anti-vaccine propaganda could be an attempt by the russians or the chinese to weaken the health of the united states population? in a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, i swear i heard a strange popping noise as her brain misfired. it actually broke her. the allure of the increasingly ridiculous conspiracy theory was just too strong. she ended up agreeing to a modified vaccine schedule. i was flabbergasted. my attending just grinned at me in response. to this day im not sure the medical ethics of the situation are totally palatable, but goddamn the result was amazing. edit: thanks for the internet points, remember folks, its all for the kids.	6094	35740	br87g0	eocpjsx

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	not a doctor but so (significant other) works with children that have autism. she has one parent that consistently tells her she regrets vaccinating her kid. she then asks questions to my so about which vaccines are the ones that cause autism as if its a big secret. my so tells her that autism is predetermined before birth and signs just arent noticeable until around 2 years of age. she still tries to justify her logic with other antivaxx parents stories from fb. my so has 2 masters degrees towards this field. it blows my mind how they can still argue with overwhelming facts.	1098	35740	br87g0	eobnzd8

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	in medical school i saw a kiddo whose parents refused vaccines and so when they were given the vaccine refusal form to sign. this form essentially said that the parents understood that refusing vaccines was against medical advice, that their kiddo could get sick from all those preventable diseases, and that the they wouldnt hold the doctor/practice liable for any complications that the kiddo may get from said preventable diseases. this mom pulled out a sharpie and blacked out the part about the doctor not being held liable. the parents thought that wed be cool with them just changing that form just for them and they wanted the doctor to be held liable for their moronic choice. of course this didnt work and they were told to sign the form or they would be discharged from the practice and have to find another. they refused to sign and were told to leave after given a list of other pediatricians in the area.	6884	35740	br87g0	eobgisb

"not a doctor, but a nurse and a vaccine advocate. once had a public argument with a friend from long ago. he argued that by not vaccinating his kids and risking ""terrible side effects and possible autism,"" he was placing no one else at risk, however acknowledged the potential risk to his kids. after attempting to explain the potential risk to others and him failing to understand, i created an analogy which i still use to this day. imagine if my kids and your kids get into the same car. both of your kids don't put on seat belts. therefore, if there is an accident, there is an increased risk that your kids will die and also harm my children in the process. this seemed to click with him and he doesn't share his anti-vac propaganda on social media anymore."	6015	35740	br87g0	eobgol3

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	i was a medical student when this happened. my attending pediatrician gave me a heads up about the parent i was about to see and decided it would be best if he came into the room with me. four year old kid came in with a horrible cough and difficulty breathing. it was almost sure as hell pertussis aka whooping cough. the kid was coughing so bad he vomited on the exam table. . he went on to ask about vaccinating her kid and of course she replied no even though her son was damn near coughing up his lung right next to her. i think my attending had seen enough and had enough of her not vaccinating her kid and had the following conversation with the kids mom attending: mrs. ____ i have to ask you. do you trust me with as your sons doctor? mom: of course i do dr. ____ attending: well, theres two problems here that we need to address. one, you either think you are more knowledgeable than me when it comes to medicine, and if thats the case i should no longer be your sons doctor. or you dont trust me as a physician and in that case i shouldnt be your sons doctor. mom: *blank stare on face* attending: will you please reconsider giving your son a vaccine? mom: no my attending obviously treated her kid, but after this whole ordeal resolved he fired her and her son as a patient and referred them to another pediatrician. he had enough of her shit. i respected the hell out of him after he pulled this move. edit: thanks for the hardware kind stranger! id like to take the opportunity to educate people on vaccines. i thought the following links might be helpful. vaccine info for parents: (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/childhood-vaccines/index.html?s_cid=pn-ncird-oy3-child-aw-cdc-cdcvacsched-phr-2-search) diseases that vaccines prevent: (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/diseases/index.html) ingredients in vaccines and why they are used: (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm) possible side effects of vaccines: (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm)	12391	35740	br87g0	eobir9y

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	pediatric resident here in the us. our continuity clinic accepts everyone, including those kicked out of previous practices for anti-vaccination beliefs, which is a bit frustrating at times. really, it's a mixed bag for how we can handle these patients. ostracizing the parents is only going to build further barriers between provider and kid, so that doesn't help. frankly, what has worked best in my experience is to try to understand where the families are coming from, explicitly asking what their thoughts are on vaccines to let them voice their (mis)understandings. oftentimes, this is the first time they've been allowed to talk about their questions and concerns regarding vaccines with a trained md that doesn't just belittle them. most frustratingly, it takes patience and time. assessing where they are regarding change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, etc.) helps determine where we are for vaccinating them today, in a month, or in a few months. one thing that i do draw the line on is to make sure that we see these kids more frequently than normal children, as they are at higher risks for illnesses because they are not vaccinated (no room for negotiation on that point). this helps two fold: first, it helps build rapport with the family, but also secondly, if they decide to take a delayed schedule (which is still not ideal, but better than no vaccines), we can eventually catch them up to speed with their vaccinations by frequent return visits. interestingly, it's always the yoga-pant's karen types that are the antivaxxer (or pro-measles as i've been calling them lately) rather than the less educated single mom's on welfare or the recent immigrants that speak no english. ultimately, we're the kids docs and their advocates, and are most effective when we ally with the families (or better put, get the families to ally with us) and do have to be stern after a certain point. it's a mix of being stern, but also compromising to work with families to provide their kids as much and the best (data supported) care as possible.	2476	35740	br87g0	eobnlqs

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	when i was a medical student, i had a 5 year old patient who looked and acted like a 2 year old (failure to thrive). his mother was super super weird. she shaved the sides of his head (somehow like a marine cut) but kept his back hair long. she refused to vaccinate him or even feed him certain foods. her sister and her husband were trying to get custody of the child because his mother was weird and didn't take care of him properly (i suspect she was paranoid). she would literally fight and call you names if you attempt to suggest to put the kid on a proper hospital diet. she wanted to inspect the food first and make sure he eats only certain things. long story short the attending calling county and they took the child away from her. edit: thank you for those who pointed out that the haircut is called a mullet cut! another point to add, he was admitted for a fracture which was really worrisome in a kid that age. unfortunately i don't know what happened to the kid after they took him away, but he's definitely better off!	19996	35740	br87g0	eob7nih

"this story is going to lose something in print but here goes: &#x200b; was a med student at the time on a ob rotation. was waiting for my attending when he came in and just basically grunted and lightly tapped his head off of his keyboard before beginning to click away. i asked what happened when he explained that the couple that was here for a c-section were refusing vaccinations. now, vaccinating is a topic i have strong feelings about, so i asked if i could go talk to them. he allowed it. i went in and introduced myself (handle is not my real name, obviously) and said i had heard they did not want to vaccinate their soon to be born and wanted to talk about any questions or misinformation they may have heard. this was a mistake. quick picture: young white couple, the father wearing a tank top, backwards hat with an tear tattoo under his eye.you get the idea. he explains ""my buddy out east, he has kids, yo, and they got vaccinated and now they slow"" (like i said, this loses something in print) ""i got other kids and they aint vaccinated and they aint slow. that's proof right there"". i knew what i was getting myself into but continued the conversation trying to let them know the truth about vaccinating. about 10 minutes later of me hitting my head against the wall, i realize there's no way i am changing their minds. so i take my leave. i later come back to help bring the mother in to prep her for the c-section. it was myself and one nurse when the father stops us and says we can't take his wife anywhere without him. i explained it's a sterile environment and once we get prepped i will come out and bring him in. he still refuses and is getting upset at this point which is when he drops the bomb ""if i'm not there, that's when you gunna put the chip in her"". . . i said ""pardon?"" he went on to explain he thought we were going to insert a chip that would control his wife or keep tabs on her or something along those lines. ended up convincing him to wait 10 minutes and i would come get him. it took everything in my power not to write on her arm ""insert chip here"". &#x200b; during the surgery my attending actually ended up convincing him to allow certain vaccinations, i can't remember which but it was a small victory."	559	35740	br87g0	eobviai

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	"i had a kid come in that was super sick. 3 years old and in septic shock. he had the flu and another compounded viral infection (or maybe pertussis). heart rate was close to 200, respiratory rate in the 50s, blood pressure in the 70s. kid was so fucking dry that we could barely get ivs into him and i almost had to drill an io. we dumped a ton of fluids into him, started him on vasopressors and transferred him to the local children's hospital. i had asked the mom if he was vaccinated and she said ""no, vaccines have really bad side effects! they'll make you sick."" i explained to her that not getting the vaccines had made her kid 10 times sicker than he ever would have been from any mild vaccine reaction. she told me i was a fucking moron and that i obviously have no clue what i'm talking and that's the reason her kid was getting transferred. she also told me that recommending she vaccinate her kids was racist. edit: didn't expect this to blow up so some clarifications and answers to common questions: - cps was called and, once again, i was told there would be no investigation. this is their usual response. - my wording about it possibly being pertussis was clearly confusing and misleading. i fucked up how i phrased it. pertussis is indeed bacterial. made the edit to make it more clear. - rn and np student, not an md. - this was like 2 years ago, i don't remember all the specifics. - i didn't follow up with the other hospital about how the kid did. i try not to follow up on patients to keep things compartmentalized."	20846	35740	br87g0	eob5ak7
doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	i have the opposite of what youre expecting to hear, i assume. as a medical student, i went to see a young child (<1yo) in the outpatient clinic before the attending. the child was due for vaccines, and i talked to the parents about getting them on that day. the parents said they had reservations about them, so i talked to them about their reservations. we talked about all of the things they had read on the internet, and walked through each point one by one (one of the benefits of being the medical student is that you have nothing but time). i explained how vaccines are made and how they work (they dont have the mercury preservative they once did; some vaccines are live but attenuated and others are immunogenic sequences bound to a protein), and why we get so many so early (thats when youre most likely to be affected by these diseases). they were concerned about the effects of so many vaccines at once (this is a common concern, but we challenge your system less with a vaccine than you see walking around in the world every day) and about them making the child sick (not possible with anything but a live vaccine, and thats why those are attenuated; theyre such a small dose that a non-immunocompromised individual should have no problem with them even though you might feel a little sick because we activate your immune system and thats how you feel when that happens). the whole discussion took probably half an hour. and then they decided to go forward with the vaccines. as it turns out, most people are just scared. and who can blame them? with all of the misinformation in the world, its easy to see how parents get to that point. but they also are human, and when you sit and talk to them like the people that they are (intelligent and able to understand your points) they respond in a positive way. its one of the moments in medical school that i reflect on frequently, especially when things are tough and i feel like being impatient with people. edit: thanks for popping my gold cherry y'all. so happy to hear about everyone who has had similar experiences with doctors taking the time to listen to their concerns and explain the responses to them. i hope everyone can work to reduce cynicism about this and other important problems.	20209	35740	br87g0	eobg03h

"not a doctor but i work it at a hospital. i came to fix a nurse's computer in the er and there was a woman being led out by a pack of half a dozen police officers. she was ranting and raving about how the doctors were killing her baby and she was going to sue the hospital and track down the doctors and have her boyfriend kill them, ect. the whole nine yards. kid was crying in their room and was being restrained by more officers and nurses. kid (who was like 9) calmed down after about 5 more minutes. i asked what that was about once everything calmed down and i was told that the kid got bit by a raccoon. animal control had captured and destroyed a raccoon that tested positive for rabies on the same street that the mother and child lived on only a day or two prior. animal control was actively searching for this raccoon as well since it had apparently just gone up to the house in broad daylight and entered the garage where the kid was playing and bit him before running away. obviously this is an extremely high likelihood of another infected animal and the kid needed the rabies vaccine. well the er doctor had made 2 mistakes. one, he had not initially referred to it as a ""rabies vaccine"" but rather as a ""series of injections to prevent rabies from infecting the child"". most anyone would hear that and suspect ""vaccine"" but apparently the mother had not only never heard of the rabies vaccine, but didn't initially interpret preventive injections as a vaccination either. she was told the boy would need the first injection as soon as possible and since we had the medicine on site we could do it right away. the mother consented to the treatment and the physician made the order and went on to explain the procedure to the mother in greater detail to make sure she was properly informed; which is when the he made his second mistake, which was referring to the rabies injections as the rabies vaccine. the security cameras above the nurses stations caught the details but the mother lost her gourd over this. she screamed at the doctor for so many things. she accused him of trying to deceive her, that she never would have agreed to the procedure if she knew it was a vaccine. she said he was trying to poison her child and give him the autism. she accused him of being a pedophile because he wanted to stick something in her boy. finally she accused him of being racist (all three of them are black). by this point other nurses, in hospital security, and a few actual officers are all at the room. the kid is crying, terrified obviously. the mother wants to take her rabies infected kid home and away from this place of nightmares. to be honest, there are a lot of crazy people in the er and up until this point its all somewhat normal. that all changed when a nurse showed up with the actual rabies vaccine and needle for administration. the previously hysteric mother hit another level when she saw the needle and just straight up attacked the doctor, pounding on his head, back, and shoulders while screaming. i could hear this part all the way down the hall as i was coming to fix the computer. she wasn't even saying words anymore, just screaming. she was restrained by officers who had already called for backup and who arrived slightly before i did to escort her away. since i work in it and not in medicine or legal, i'm not entirely sure what the procedure from that point on was. i did follow up with the nurse a few weeks later who told me that animal control had captured and destroyed two more infected raccoons in the area but were not able to determine if either one was the one who bit the kid. the kid did eventually receive is vaccinations and was doing ok. i wasn't told what happened with the mother. that's my most interesting experience with anti-vax people in general"	281	35740	br87g0	eobrf81

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	as an emergency pediatrics doctor i see a lot of unvaccinated patients. the one thing i dont see are unvaccinated patients from any second or third world countries because they remember what these diseases are and can do. my advice- get the vaccines on the schedule and quit wasting time thinking about it. worry more about unnecessary antibiotics or steroid therapies given to your kid- they have frequent common side effects. other than a needle poke, vaccines dont. vaccines are by far the safest medical therapies we have. consider getting vaccines a tiny price we have to pay because we live in society- like stopping at red lights in the middle of the night when no one is around bc some idiot is driving with no lights on coming down that side street. ps- i get no secret checks from the government, my kids are all fully vaccinated, i am fully vaccinated and actually get extra vaccines because i am in the health care field so i dont spread stuff around. let it go- concentrate on researching something else. pps- many in the anti-vax community make a lot of $$$ selling misinformation. i get nothing for telling the truth- who should you believe? : be well	117	35740	br87g0	eoc8n2y

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	med student here. one of the well known, respected professors at my state college let it slip during a lecture that his wife is anti-vax. this was shocking because not only is our professor very pro-vax, but hes a microbiologist. his wife works as a mid wife, and is a highly educated woman! she wasnt always anti-vax, and quickly adopted the view alongside the oncoming trend. once their children were born and older, my professor attempted to sway his children into some late vaccinations, but they wouldnt budge (mostly out of laziness). i asked him how he could compromise on something like this, and he told me they nearly divorced over it. it was something they just couldnt agree on and were never going to, so he caved. i think i am too young to comprehend his reasoning, but if my partner was suddenly against vaccinating our children, i would leave. thats not something i could have in my life and thats not something im willing to compromise on.	237	35740	br87g0	eobp05p

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	i've told this story before, but the worst was when i was in medical school. the woman actually brought her daughter in to get catchup vaccines. why? because her other daughter was in the icu with fulminant meningitis from a vaccine-preventable illness, hanging on for dear life. the nurse there sat her down and told her point-blank that she rarely sees this disease because people are vaccinated for it. the mom couldnt understand how her girl had contracted it. we asked if she knew anyone who wasnt vaccinated. apparently no one in her church vaccinated, and several had been sick recently. she couldnt believe the source could be them. the kicker? she also brought her son to clinic, but refused to vaccinate him, saying hes my only son. no matter how we explained it to her, she believed giving her son the vaccine would result in brain damage.	146	35740	br87g0	eobnri7

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	not a dr. when i was a kid i was in boy scouts. i was older around 16-17 and one of the younger kids around 12 was from a really religious family that homeschooled all the kids. well, this kid had to go to the bathroom at 2 in the morning. so he got out of his tent to go piss. he was barefoot and cut a large slice into the ball of his foot by stepping on a piece of flint. the gash was almost two inches long and needed a lot of stitches. i was the largest person at the camp, so i had to carry the kid a mile to our vehicles. the adults and i then drove him to the medical lodge where they would take care of him (this camp had several thousand boys in it during the summer, so they always had a doctor on staff). well, the doctor cleaned the wound and gave the boy the stitches and then talked to him about the importance of wearing shoes outside. the kid had always gone around barefoot at home, so it was just second nature for him. it's one thing to walk around your manicured yard barefoot, but to walk around a rocky campground, at night, with coperheads and rattlesnakes is something that should never be done. we were almost done with the doctor when he said he needed to give the boy a tetanus shot. he looked at the boy's medical chart that was loaded on his computer (we had to get physicals to come to the camp, all these were scanned and loaded into a computer so that any boy could go to either of the 2 medical areas and they would be able to look up the info). the dr. said he could not give the boy a tetanus shot because the boy never had the initial shot or series. in fact, the kid had never received any shots or vaccines. the doctor was honestly confused as to how the boy had been allowed to come to camp that year. the dad was with us and was basically bragging about how none of his 8 kids were vacinated. the dr ripped him a new one and told him how agonizing and painful lockjaw was. so the doctor didn't have the shot that was needed (because everyone was supposed to have already had that prior to coming to camp). we had to drive 40 minutes to the nearest hospital at 3:00 in the morning. we didn't get back until after 5:00. after that fiasco, our troop told the family that they needed to vacinate all the kids or they would never be allowed to participate in the troop. we would often do family events where young siblings would also come and participate. things like bbqs, fundrasers, day camps, etc. the troop didn't want any of these young children to be exposed to something by any of these kids. it turns out the antivax mom had been put in charge of collecting and turning in the health forms to the camp staff. she obviously just pushed her children through without making sure they had the shot record section filled out. the camp staff somehow just missed it. so she was quickly removed from that role and it was given to two other adult leaders. the camp also set an earlier deadline to submit medical forms and physicals to give them more time to review everything. the family did vaccinate their kids because they were homeschooled and lived outside the city. this was one of the few programs that their kids could do with other children that were in a conservative-minded organization.	62	35740	br87g0	eobs5jo

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	not a doctor, but have taught one girl who's parents are anti-vax. being anti-vax doesn't just affect health, but it affects a child's social development too. girl was sick for most of her life and missed out on school. therefore, she missed out on socialising with her friends. caused her to be anxious about coming to school and thus caused more absences. apparently her mum would have to drag her screaming child out of the car everyday. the girl becomes very sensitive about jokes children make and parents call in to demand that those who 'teased' their daughter be reprimanded. those peers are talked to and turns out, it was a stupid joke about poo that children her age make. girl couldn't handle being around other children who joked and continues missing out on school because she was being teased. what do parents do? pull her out and home-school her instead.	215	35740	br87g0	eoblau2

"not a doctor but a parent. when my kids were little, i was active in an online community for parents who were a little more ""crunchy"". i chose this community because i was living in a small, very conservative and right-wing city where i got along with almost no one and this community was welcoming to people from all backgrounds and races. they were also pretty full of drama and had some very opinionated parents. they used peer pressure and pseudo-science to convince new parents to be fairly extreme with their practices or they would shame them. vaxxing was one of those things (along with homebirth, staying at home for one parent, breastfeeding, eating organic foods, etc). there were otherwise lovely parents who were shunned for having a hospital birth, using formula or vaccinating. i can't imagine this online community was too different from many around the country. as a new parent dealing with the stress of having a new baby, not sleeping very much, and having your entire peer group shun you for asking the wrong questions, it's really not too difficult to see why this has spread like it did. my kids are secretly vaccinated. i wasn't willing to take the risk for their sake, but i also wasn't willing to be shunned. i am sure i am not the only one who secretly vaccinated and i wonder if the numbers of vaccinated kids is slightly higher than reported."	257	35740	br87g0	eobicxu

"i, as a 5th year student, might say that it actually happened to me once. we have the opportunity to be translators for doctors that came from united states/uk (i am from el salvador), and its even harder for us when a woman say to us that she doesn't want her children to be vaccinated. the last time i had to translate for a us doctor (very cool dude) a mother came with her kid, 2yrs old girl, very sick, and the only thing that she gave her was fish and palm oil because her 79 years old mother (the kid's grandmother) told her to do. i'm not lying when i say that, after the doctor said to me what i have to say to her, she almost slap me because a vaccine can cause, not autism, but something that here is called ""mal de luna"" a pseudo-disease where the little kid get paralyzed in a moon shape, and the only way to heal it is with a ""limpia"". kinda weird, funy tho"	41	35740	br87g0	eobjw1h
doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	nurse practitioner here. child came into the emergency dept. with a rash and upper respiratory symptoms. he was mildly autistic. definitely high functioning cute/nice kid. vaccination status changes the whole work up. mom reports that he didn't get his full series because he is autistic and obviously that first vaccine at birth caused it. so because of the lack of vaccinations the differential list is much longer and the kid gets a more invasive workup than the kid that got all his vaccines. i just think.why don't you just vaccinate him? he's not going to get more autistic! **i wanted to say that sooo bad (but respectfully didnt) when she complained about the additional tests* had rubella by the way. totally preventable with vaccinations.	44	35740	br87g0	eobu6n2

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	"not my story but actually one of my former co-workers. in med school, there was a student who was notoriously stupid. let's call him kevin to keep with the grand tradition of reddit: * kevin thought that bats were birds and that lizards were mammals. how he passed comparative anatomy is anyone's guess. * kevin bought into many fads. this made him an easy target for jenny mccarthy. * kevin didn't know anything about basic genetics like aneuploidy or even meiosis. this isn't even college-level biology. i remember learning about both these things in middle school. * kevin was going to get married and was convinced that the ""foreign dna"" would make his kid transgender. yes, he would take his anti-vax wife who sat on facebook groups as science over a room of med school students who knew how genetics worked, way better than him i may add. * to kevin, autism was something that could be transmitted like hiv/aids and would take caution against people in the room with autism by avoiding all contact, even wearing a face mask. * kevin eventually showed up at the hospital trying to dictate how to treat his child. he failed med school, obviously, and was now working as an english teacher. you would think i made this up, but i actually was with this doctor and kevin when he tried to dictate how to treat his child. it consisted of lots of essential oils."	40	35740	br87g0	eoc044x

doctors of reddit, what are some of your anti-vax parent stories?	pediatrician for 28 years here. the stories of changed minds do exist, but in my experience, they are few and far between. most of those who refuse are upper middle class, well educated, and have done personal research that has entrenched their opinions. i had one family years ago who all got pertussis; the whooping cough. they were miserable, but still had no regrets, believing that their choice was the best one for their family at the time. i dont argue with beliefs, and they remained my patients until they aged out. all refusers bring personal experience and knowledge, and expect me to be moved by their anecdotes. i in turn share with them my personal experience and knowledge, recalling having to pull pus from spinal taps done on extremely irritable babies with super high fevers. a normal spinal fluid should instead flow clear. the culture would usually grow hemophilis type b. that was my last year in residency, pretty close to the year the hib vaccine came out; i havent seen a case of invasive hemophilus disease since. but my experience and reason doesnt matter for many, and regurgitating the plethora of studies in favor of vaccines only solidifies their stance. the most sobering case was a neonate, too young to be vaccinated, who was exposed to a community of non-vaccinated children out west. he was diagnosed here, east of the mississippi, and spent three weeks in three different pediatric icus in the area before he was stable enough to go home. and the conventional wisdom that says chickenpox is no big deal. in residency i watched a teenager come in to our er (lebonheur, memphis tn) with chickenpox and die days later with overwhelming sepsis. over time, ive distilled my response to those who wish to argue to: in the end, your position holds that the experts at the acip, the aap, and. well. me. we all willingly place children in harms way. im sorry you feel that way. our practice (http://clevelandpediatrics.net) currently asks families who choose not to vaccinate to please find a pediatrician who they can trust completely. if they choose not to vaccinate, thats not us.	31	35740	br87g0	eocegm9

parents on reddit, what was your  i raised an idiot moment?	not a parent, however i feel like this belongs here. when i was about 3-4 years old i stuck a pinto bean up my nose while at preschool. there was a [sand box](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/sand-and-water-table/s278226?localedetail=us&a=1552&campaignid=1712429706&adgroupid=67277874376&targetid=pla-528299727589&pla_sku=278226&pcat=hsw&ag=kids&scid=scplp278226&sc_intid=278226&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=cjwkcajw8ltmbrbceiwabhh-6jngikhqktvkxzvw_piojefyqpfzniw0lsjdv2qohpqkj93ukdxttbocbjsqavd_bwe) that instead of being filled with sand was filled with pinto beans (im guessing they did this because beans make less of a mess) that was filled with toys for kids to play with. while playing at the table, i thought it would be fun to stick a bean up my nose, so i did exactly that. if i remember correctly, i was able to stick it up my nose and take it out successfully the first few times that i did it, but then it got stuck. so me being the smart little kid that i was, i decided not to tell anyone about. me not telling anyone was due to a mix of me being worried about what my parents would say, and not knowing how id convey to them that i had stuck a bean up my nose and couldnt get it out. eventually, a whole 7 hours later while i was taking a bath i decided it would be the right time to tell my parents what happened. i dont remember much after me telling my parents what happened, but from what theyve told me they were both highly amused and incredibly concerned as to how they ended up trying to get pinto bean out of their soaking wet childs nose. sadly, they couldnt get it out and so off to the er we went.	1557	32219	bkjqjj	emh75wv

parents on reddit, what was your  i raised an idiot moment?	"i swear my oldest is not actually a dumbass, they were just having a bad day. a few months after they got their first car, they were in a very minor, no actual damage done, accident in a parking lot. they called me panicked, i told them to relax and exchange insurance information just in case. 10 minutes later i get another panicked call because now their car won't start. i calm them down, tell them to call roadside assistance, and i'll come meet them at the parking lot. i get there just after the tow truck arrives. my oldest is nearly in tears over their car. i give them a hug, and reassure them that it's probably something minor. there's simply no way the tiny fender bender they had could've caused any damage significant enough to disable the car. the tow truck driver hops out, takes one look at my kid's car and asks ""did you put it in park before trying to start it?"", while pointing out that some light was on. my kid goes back to their car, and sure enough, in their panic over the earlier fender bender realized they had turned off the car without putting it park. thank goodness it was on a level surface. they hop in, throw it in park, and their car starts right up. much to their relief. the tow truck driver and i have a hearty laugh."	851	32219	bkjqjj	emhrx66

"my son is only one year old right now, and kids get a pass on being considered idiots until about age 3 or 4. he actually appears (both to us and to professionals) to be very intelligent; he definitely has advanced problem solving skills. he clearly didn't get it from me though, because i had quite a few of those moments as a kid. the most famous one in our family is from when i was 10. i had read this book on life in medieval times, and how people used to shave by sanding their facial hair down with a pumice stone. so i tried to do it.with sandpaper. now, again, i was 10 years old, and the only facial hair i had was a little bit of peach fuzz, and two.it's just not a good idea to sand any part of your body. my face was red and flaky for about a week! i remember, i came upstairs from my dad's workshop, my face stinging, and told my parents ""i think i did something not smart."""	1721	32219	bkjqjj	emhe7ij

parents on reddit, what was your  i raised an idiot moment?	not my parents but my relative's. my relative is an all right person but as an adult he has committed some major errors in adulting. oddly enough they all center around vehicles. he got pulled over after working at a club by a cop who suspected him of dui. refused to do the roadside test/breathalyzer and opts to get a blood draw - ends up still over the limit. license suspended, fines out the wazoo, special bonded insurance for high risk idiots, and loses his job because of the dui. fucking parents try to defend his stupidity - fuck them. time passes, fines are paid, license reinstated etc. this time he gets into an accident on a road. his fault - runs a light and gets hit by another car. both cars totaled but no serious injuries. shit happens, right? cop comes back and says his insurance is not valid. turns out he forgot to pay his car insurance for a few months. so now he has a totaled car, fines for causing the accident, cited for driving without insurance, suspended license and is going to need special insurance again once everything is settled. plus he is going to be sued by the other people's insurance company. parents didn't defend him this time.	283	32219	bkjqjj	emhkstc

what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	all your interactions with them are on their terms, not on yours. obviously, everyone's different, and so you'll always have to make some kinds of compromises when you do something with another person - whether that's picking things to do that neither of you love but both of you enjoy, or picking things that one person loves one day and the other the next. but if you find that you're constantly having to put some part of your personality or interests aside in order to interact with someone on their terms instead of yours, that's not a healthy friendship. and that doesn't have to inherently be anything wrong with you or them, or make either of you bad people, which is why it can be so hard to break off a friendship like that, but if you're not on an equal footing it's not going to be healthy or helpful for either of you.	2316	37707	btb5si	eovkmwi

what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	always insulting you, insisting it's a joke, getting upset if you say anything back. it might sound obvious but it took me way too long to realize what a problem it was, and even longer to realize i didn't have to put up with it.	687	37707	btb5si	eovl87b
what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	as a rule of thumb: do they make your life better? if not, then it's not a good friendship. i came to this realization with a couple of long term friends i had from back in the day. they would never really do anything nice for you, we basically just hung out out of habit. you couldn't expect them to be there for you if you needed a favor, even small ones. with one there was also constant ribbing, he'd play it off as joking, but it was closer to insults. i eventually came to the realization that these guys don't make my life better in any way. i can replace them with people who actually give a shit. this may come off as selfish sounding, but you have to remember to reciprocate and be a good friend too. if your friend needs a favor, and it's not unreasonable and you can do it, then do it. if you're always there for a friend and they don't reciprocate, then you're just being used. if you're not there for your friend but expect them to be there for you, then you're the one who is a tool.	937	37707	btb5si	eovuvxm

what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	you are drained after you hang out. edit: not drained in the sense where an introvert feels drained by social interaction. other posters said it better than i did. its drained in the sense that you give everything to this person in terms of attention and receive little in return. its the friend who can quite literally only talk about themselves for hours and hours. its usually about some trivial problem theyve decided they want to psychoanalyze yet again. bonus points for exhausting amounts of repetition and reaching years into the past to retread old ground. you are lucky to get a word on edgewise. if you do get a word in, friend will turn that convo back to their interests whiplash fast. rinse, repeat into infinity.	311	37707	btb5si	eovsmlj

what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	if they don't listen to you in conversations but rather are sitting there waiting for their turn to speak, it's a dealbreaker. if they are permanently an innocent victim, surrounded by wrongdoers, that's a dealbreaker. if they are a drama-mama or a drama-papa, that is a deal.break.er. if they only call you when they need something, they are *using* you. dealbreaker if they are not happy for you when something good happens, but instead lament how they are not as happy - dealbreaker. if they exclude you intentionally, talk about you behind your back, spill your secrets. those are major dealbreakers, shut it down.	270	37707	btb5si	eovsdvm
what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	when they are never happy for you when you achieve something you've been working hard for, and instead try to bring you down ('are you sure you can cope with that level of responsibility?' 'do you really think you'll fit into that company?'). allied to this, they are judgmental and bad mouth you and criticise you to mutual friends. they can't be trusted with keeping your problems secret-they gossip simply for the sake of putting you down because that makes them feel superior. bitterness and envy-a genuine friend would be happy for you. when all the arrangements are left up to you-you do all the running, all the organising, booking the cinema/theatre etc, you do all the driving collecting them for events or nights out. they freeload without any reciprocity. they lack empathy-they expect you to be there for their crises (like relationship break ups), but don't reciprocate. they don't want to know about your stresses and problems, they only want the fun bits. they suck the life and spirit out of you-if you start to feel stressed or worried at the thought of meeting up with them, and if you feel exhausted and drained at the end of the evening with them, its not a healthy relationship. a friendship should leave you feeling energised and happy, not miserable.	245	37707	btb5si	eovxq52

what are some red flags of a bad friendship?	"a lot of these are about the other person being dicks. but here's one that's not: if they're always agreeing with you/always know about the same band/movie/tv show/game you're talking about. &#x200b; when i was younger i had a friend and if you took him on face value, he liked all the same stuff as me! but he had no insight into them (like, he likes all their songs dude, they're all so good, it's hard to pick just one favourite). &#x200b; many people said he's a liar and to cut him off, he's a bad person, can't trust him, etc. &#x200b; but he was just trying to connect with me, and i guess he felt like he needed to impress me? so i flipped the switch and started modelling behaviour for him. ie ask him what music he's listening to - and even if i have heard it, say ""oh i haven't heard of them, what's some good songs? you should put it on now while we drive"" etc. eventually this gave him the confidence to do the same back - he realised he didn't have to know everything to be cool, that the coolness came from sharing experiences and introducing people to new shit. that the feeling he got of niceness when i'd say ""hey i checked out that show, it's really good!"" also comes with a good feeling for him. whereas to many others in our group he was the ""annoying yes man"" and they'd just reject him and leave him out of shit."	23	37707	btb5si	eowxiw2

why is your ex an ex?	we dated for about 6 years, and i thought things were going quite well. when we started dating, she thought she was asexual and so sex wasn't really a main focus in our relationship, which wasn't a dealbreaker for me so i rolled with it. about a month or two before we broke up, i could feel some distance being forged between us. at first i chalked it up to her being busy with a new job and family obligations - but more and more she would reference one of her coworkers. i'd be lying if i said it didn't bother me, but i trusted her completely, so i didn't tell her not to talk to him or anything, and she reassured me that there was nothing going on between them. well, one night we're talking over messenger and our conversation took a pretty serious turn where she basically admitted to me that she didn't think she was as asexual as she thought she was, and that she didn't find me appealing in that way at all. it devastated me, but i ultimately accepted it. naturally, i asked if her coworker had any role in her decision to breakup, which she was adamant that he didn't. not even two weeks later, i find out that the two of them started dating, which *really* made me go into a deep depression. i'm happy to say that it's been a little over a year since then, and i've lost over 130 pounds (and am finally at a healthy weight for the first time in my adult life), my social life is the best it's ever been, i got my degree, and have an excellent new job. at one point i thought my life was over, and in some regards, i was right - my life as i had known it *was* over - but my new life is so much better.	2074	27636	buz6lq	epk5l9z

why is your ex an ex?	this was the worst one. we were in a long distance relationship. it wasn't working out for him though so he broke up with me. we still kept daily contact however. when he came back to visit (my city is his home), he told me that he missed me and so we hung out the entire week he was there, had sex and all that. i was pretty sure we were going to make it work and get back together (that's what i was hoping) turns out, when he went back to his other country, i found out by luck that he was actually in a relationship with another girl. so yeah. he cheated on her with me. the best part? this was a girl that i had some red flags up on when we were still together and he was actually dating her while we were still together. yup. felt like a complete idiot and that's how he became my ex forever.	2558	27636	buz6lq	epjr8po

why is your ex an ex?	my girlfriend was verbally abusive on a regular basis. she would also get physically abusive when she drank too much. she wasnt really strong enough to hurt me seriously, but when the person you love starts trying to suckerpunch you it is really frustrating. i still miss her a lot. some days she was wonderful and the sweetest person ever. others she was bitter, angry, and would do anything to try to get a reaction out of me by insulting me. started to become my insecure high school self after a while and had to give up. she dealt with a lot of really horrible abuse in her past and i didn't want to ever be the next abuser because of my own anger and frustration so i had to let her go. still miss her. still love her. wish things had been different	9883	27636	buz6lq	epjqhsh

why is your ex an ex?	not really an ex but someone i dated for a month or two. started talking about marriage and having kids after the third or fourth date. would call me in the middle of the night because she needed help with something that any fully functional adult should be able to do by themselves, i.e. stuff like lifting a 10 lbs object from the floor and placing it on a counter. finally broke it off when she told me i'm gonna have to cut any and all ties to one of my best friends because i'm not allowed to talk to other girls now that we're dating. &#x200b; she ended up stalking me for like six months, threatened to a) kill me in my sleep or b) walk up to the police and tell them i had raped her (glad she typed that out in detail so i could just easily screencap everything in case i ever needed the evidence), called me at 4 am multiple times after getting shitfaced at a bar and when i'd switch my phone off, she'd send me 80+ messages that usually evolved from trying to guilt trip me to take her back into borderline psychotic ranting and empty threats. she eventually fucked some old dude, got an std, and claimed it was my fault because i had forced her to do that by not wanting to be with her. &#x200b; so that was fun while it lasted.	2708	27636	buz6lq	epjqms4
why is your ex an ex?	he didn't feel as strongly about me as i did about him. and he didn't care about how i felt during sex. eta: surprised that this comment blew up! wanted to clarify that i am a woman and that the main sex issue was that i need time to work up to comfortably putting his manly bit into my lady bits. i did communicate this to him and we had what i thought was very satisfying sex several times after that, despite him having a bit of attitude of this again? whenever i wasnt immediately ready to be jackhammered after a minute of making out. he told me in the aftermath of our relationship that he thought our physical relationship was completely unenjoyable. there were other things too that he did that made it clear to me that he didnt care how i felt during sex like often wanting oral but never giving it and needing reminders to put on a condom despite the fact that i wasnt on birth control for part of the relationship.	7123	27636	buz6lq	epjql16

why is your ex an ex?	"he had a sneeze fetish that he obsessed unhealthily over. in my sleep he'd ball up cat hair and try to put it into my nose. i didn't know he was doing this to me until i had a nasty sinus infection and had my sinus flooded out at urgent care. out came small balls of cat hair. the final straw was cheating on me with a girl who had a bigger nose than me. she was his ex and he just couldn't get over that nose dedpite the fact she was literally psychotic. they were perfect for eachother. not my loss. but my mistake ever trying to be tolerant and understanding of him. makes great material for the biography i'll never write. edit:i'm new to reddit and didn't expect this to blow up haha. for more context i suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. (doing much better now that my insurance actually covers the meds!) and he took advantage of the frequent opportunities. i hadnt noticed but suddenly there was a searing pain and one of my sinus got very puffy. i had taken a couple days off work and eventually went to urgent care where they did the flush. (it was my second time going back there desperate for help) when the two very small balls came out neither the doc or i knew what the fuck it was. doc worried it was a mold of sorts until he broke one apart in his hand and could tell it was small black strands of hair. i was confused and it didn't click until on the cab ride home what it was from. i confronted him which didnt get very far (wrote about that in another comment.) still had lingering pain but it wasnt nearly as bad after. i understand this is hard to believe but at the very least you can confirm the fetish is real with a simple search. sorry for typos, i suck at texting on my phone. edit again: it's perfectly okay to laugh. myself laughing at this is how i coped through it at the time. in the moment i was devastated, totally emotionally wrecked and confused at pretty much every aspect of it. but my friends were great and like ""*dude. what if you had a child and she sneezed? nothing would ever be normal.*"" and they helped me laugh through it all."	15178	27636	buz6lq	epjrqg3

why is your ex an ex?	"he threatened suicide every few weeks. he constantly performed ""tests"" on me to see if i loved him enough or that i could be trusted. i *always* failed them. he would demand i stay up on the phone almost every night until 1am or later listening, not talking, to him. i would be expected to stay awake and listen to his rambling anecdotes for hours silently. if i spoke, i'd make him lose his train of thought. if i fell asleep, i got screamed at or a day of the cold shoulder. these are just a few examples. i was a young teenager who got sucked into a cycle of psychological abuse for a few years. i'm fine now for the most part. edit: to those replying that they've been through this too, i'm sorry. edit 2: i'm working through replies to this, and i'm noticing a lot of people are getting a downvote or two. it seems to be the comments which start with some variant of ""wow did we date the same person?"". whoever is doing this, stop it. i don't like it. these people experienced a similar situation, and they deserve the same respect my own post has received."	8621	27636	buz6lq	epjzzpl

why is your ex an ex?	an 8-year lasagna of me being noticeably depressed, me not making continuous romantic gestures, a long-term sense of complacency on both our parts and both of us gravitating towards opposite directions in life. i dated her for almost a decade (im 25), and our time together made me a better person. im grateful for the time we shared and dont regret it, but ive made my peace and spent nearly 2 years swallowing that bitter, gargantuan pill. i wish her the best and view her in warm regard, but i dont want to be her friend or even cross paths with her ever again. getting over the breakup had to be the hardest thing ive ever done, and picking that scab just to keep up the meaningless platitude of we can still be friends would be a waste of both of our time.	1191	27636	buz6lq	epjwn6b

"i'll only give my last two to keep it somewhat concise. the woman before my last ex. well she had the unfortunate timing of being with me when my father/best friend died unexpectedly when i was in my early twenties. while we had been together about 3 years, i said fuck the world and turned into an alcholic and moved 2000 miles away. i actually feel bad for her. queue 6 months into my self destructive path i am sleeping with this girl(on the wrong side of the crazy/hot scale) pretty much daily, but i have made it clear it is a fwb situation and i am not interested in a relationship with her. that didnt work for her. but idgaf so i keep putting my dick in crazy and drinking (hindsight is 20/20). so when i start casually dating another woman on the side 6 months later she(crazy>hot) is pissed and takes it out on my vehicle and with a bout of stalking. that ""other woman"" somehow stuck with me, got me help for my drinking, helped me move past the loss of my father and some moderate ptsd from the military; then became my wife and mothered my children. i dont know what i did to deserve her but she literally saved my life and i'll never be able to repay her."	2364	27636	buz6lq	epjsga4

why is your ex an ex?	i had been considering breaking up with her for a while because she would lie about little things that made no sense lying about. never cheated or anything, but would do anything so that she would get more attention from me and other people. i started noticing this when one night she sent me screenshots of her text messages between her and her dad. i had known her dad for a while and the things he was saying in these texts were awful. they were things like youre worthless i wish you werent my daughter they were things he would never ever say. if there was one thing he showed was how much he loved his two daughters. i was kind of skeptical when she sent me these because he would never say that stuff, but obviously i couldnt just come out and tell her i didnt believe her cause if it was true then id be a terrible person. what i thought was happening was i thought she was changing her contact info and texting herself making it seem like it was her dad who was sending that stuff. anyways, this happens a few more times in the next few weeks and im just there for her trying to be a good boyfriend because theres always a chance it could be true. well one weekend she went to a concert with her friend and after the concert she was drunk and we were facetiming and she told me that i was still in love with my ex. immediately im like what are you talking about why do you say that?? and she responds by telling me that i texted my ex telling her i still love her and she has the screenshot. i told her to send it to me and there it was a screenshot of me telling my ex i love her. the problem was that i never sent that and it was obvious she texted herself saying that because she was drunk and wasnt able to type that out correctly. she made it realistic though, because she even went out of her way to use the exact contact picture i had for my ex which was a very unique dumb picture. the moment this happened i knew the screenshots of her dad werent real and i proceeded to say goodnight and break up with her the day she got back. that is why she is my ex.	58	27636	buz6lq	epk2jls

why is your ex an ex?	he is a textbook narcissist. emotionally abused, manipulated, and gaslit me every day. constantly used other women to make me feel insecure by telling me how sexy and successful they were. ultimately, he sent nude photos and videos of me to seven of my friends and exes along with few people that i didnt know. but because he had convinced me he was the best id ever have, it took two and a half years to leave.	48	27636	buz6lq	epk7dbk
why is your ex an ex?	he broke up with me for a bullshit reason that didn't make sense. 8 months later i realized it was because i was getting help for my depression and becoming more independent and not letting him control me. he didn't like the fact that he didn't own me anymore and having me as a play toy wasn't fun for him anymore. months after we broke up was when i realized he had been emotionally and verbally abusing me for years.	433	27636	buz6lq	epjsei6
why is your ex an ex?	because he wanted to start selling drugs to his friends. we've been living together for maybe 3 years, and i didn't agree to this idea, at all. but the thing is, his business started to grow way too fast, and i got tired. so tired that one day, after i saw the 300+ pills stash, i decided i wanted to live on my own. and he dumped me for that, but i only heard the big new the day after, when he invited his ex over at our appartment while i was working. oh well, big bullet dodged, because a week after i left, he got busted and now has a criminal reccord. but hey, i'm finally over with these years of toxicity. and i got to keep the doggo, and this big old boi is the love of my life, no doubt.	223	27636	buz6lq	epjzvrt

why is your ex an ex?	1. it was my first and my insecurities took over me. like i was that dude that did his own thing and had pretty low self esteem. she was the super popular girl in school despite being an underclassman and was actually recruited to do some modeling. 2. she never was straight up with me. we had differences she always held to herself and it exploded in a single instant. 3. we were kind of a-holes to each other. better of separated. we tried getting back together but the bad stuff we did to one another were stuck in my head and i just had to stop it. 4. she kept hiding and lying to me. like it was way too damn obvious because she was never able to ever look me in the eye when we had problems. pretty explosive too like ron and tammy 2 explosive. she ended up avoiding seeing me for like a month despite us living literally a block away from each other. we broke up when she texted me she liked another guy instead. probably just a way out so i break up with her so she doesnt to me. knew she was lying but if shes gotta do it like that then shes not worth it.	173	27636	buz6lq	epjtb5j
why is your ex an ex?	cheated on me, then blamed the guys death on me (he died in a motorcycle crash at speeds 200+km/h) he was at her place and i surprised her by showing up unexpectedly and he left out the back door. accused me of having incestuous relationship with my mother and sister when i would choose to spend time with them instead of her. threaten a false rape allegation when i wanted to join the military instead of staying home with her. she also was physically and emotionally abusive. just an all around horrible little whore that broke me and gave me long lasting trust issues. this was almost 12 years ago now, and the affects are still present, even after therapy. she was my first love i guess, she was the first sexual partner, looking back at it i should have listened to her father when he said i should run and i should have thought it was weird her mother and father was ok with a 16 year old sleeping in the same bed as their 14 year old daughter.	124	27636	buz6lq	epjyvh9
why is your ex an ex?	boy was i in love with her. we got a nice place together, same schedule, same hobbies. it was great. we were set to graduate college and.i honestly felt like it was a dream come true. then, one day, her brothers body was found in his apartment 1,000 miles away up in seattle. he was a junky and had been missing for weeks. he overdosed, it was terribly sad. she flew up to washington to set his affairs in order. i told her id go with her.its my biggest regret that i didnt. she stayed in washington. i had this huge apartment, our dog, our furniture, our vehicles. i kept trying to reach her but.nothing. by the time cellphones and the internet became prevalent i tried other ways to find her. i even flew up to seattle to see if i could locate any trace of her. all i found was her brothers tombstone in a cemetery. i paid my respects and left. she was gone. never came back. ive tried finding her on social media. but ive come to the conclusion that; as much as i loved her, she had her own path to follow. and i love her just the same. i hope shes still out there, and happy. i miss you, sweetheart. ill never forget you.	63	27636	buz6lq	epkwpul

europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	dutchy here, the usa is my favorite holiday destination, i'd even move there if i could. i've toured the west, california, arizona, nevada. spent a week in las vegas and another week in manhattan. the biggest wtf: you guys are really friendly, this is not the image to us has abroad but i can't remember any notable bad encounters, just one waitress with a shitty attitude insisting on getting a tip anyway which is somewhat understandable. i don't even know why the nyc subway gets a bad rap. second wtf: how huge your roads are, driving in the us boils down to pressing the gas to go, pressing the brake to stop. just point it in the general direction you want to go and you'll be fine, lanes are too wide to hit anything.no engine braking though, drive up to the traffic light, hit the brakes at the last possible moment. i've had multiple people honk at me for letting go of the gas and just letting the car roll when i saw a red light in the distance.	528	39727	bv6o78	epnwxb1

europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	australian here. i did a lot of hiking in america around cali and the south west. my first comment is how amazing your national parks are, backed up by an organised park service. i havent seen camp sites in australia half as organised as yours. second was how cheap food is! as i was road tripping i originally planned to cook for myself out the back of my van. but honestly it was cheaper to eat at dennys, where i only had to hit breakfast and dinner and i was set for the day - the portion sizes were huge. third. wtf is with your toilets! they are filled to the brim with water, and your poo just sorta floats around until you flush where it then goes around in circles until it goes down the drain. my first few craps in your great nation was really unsettling. but i got used to it by the end. fourth. the disparity between rich and poor. like you see it in australia a between suburbs bit - but it was just so pronounced in america.	197	39727	bv6o78	epo039d

europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"went to l.a. a week last year for work. things like portion sizes, the average weight of people, quality of food and commercials etc. are just what i thought they would be. but the surprises for me: 1) i do know the modeled los santos in gta from l.a. but i didn't realise how well they did it. people talk and behave basically the same way. the sound, the light, the landscape, the frickin radio! i thought a big part of it was just exaggeration. nope! this was actually kind of fun, driving around looking at things going ""oh wow this is where that thing happened in the game"". awesome! 2) there are a lot of homeless people and you can tell a lot of them are sick and/or have psychological problems. this sure doesn't remove any of my prejudice about american healthcare and social security. 3) the extreme differences between neighbourhoods that are right next to each other. sure, i understand why one street might have houses that look nice and are well taken care of and another not so much. but why is there a difference in how well paved the road is? why is the ""poor"" street in such decay with lots of potholes and the ""rich"" street so clean and free from pot holes? aren't things like fixing the roads the responsibility of the city? mind boggling that they care more about rich neighbourhoods and the poor ones. if they did that so blatantly back here there'd be some shit and a big fan involved. generally the social class differences are of a magnitude i've never seen before. honestly i thought the things i heard before where somewhat exaggerated. i was wrong. and it is right in front of you basically all of the time! really really sad to see."	1589	39727	bv6o78	epn0oqj
europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	that there's a whole channel about the weather, it runs 24 hours a day and makes everything seem hyper-dramatic, and it's grimly watchable, mainly because broadcast tv is so crap. also a wtf is the sheer number of adverts that us viewers put up with on broadcast tv. the most popular tv channel here in the uk has no adverts, and even the main commercial channels have few adverts compared to most us tv.	44	39727	bv6o78	epnncez

europeans whove visited the us, what made you go wtf?	"i own a restaurant and could never be in that business if i had to do it the way americans do. ""the customer is always right"" in my country means that even though a request seems unreasonable or means extra effort for you, you do your best to make it happen because you want the guest to be happy and have a memorable experience. if they complain about something you, within reason, try your best to make it right and don't argue or get offended. however, it seemed to me that in the us that means ""the customer can treat the hard working staff like shit and gets rewarded for it"". also the compensation is absolutely ridiculous. you bought something and accidentally broke it the minute you got home? here, have your money back and a brand new item. you didn't like the food even though you ate all of it? no check for you sir, have some free desert as well. in my country ""not liking something"" is a you problem. better luck next time. you don't get to pick something else just because you picked wrong (of course i do sometimes make an exception). and if you treat my staff like crap, you're out of my business fast. i was shocked by the amount of people i witnessed being rude or short with wait staff or casiers. who are, btw, super friendly, cheerful and welcoming 99,9% of the time. the hospitality is awesome, way better than in most places in europe i think, but this made me go wtf. in addition to that: the tipping system as part of the wages of the employees appalls me and the taxes not being added in the price that is shown is just inconvenient."	954	39727	bv6o78	epmm0en

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was 7 or 8, i would have a reoccurring nightmare that one of my dolls came to life, played with me, and then would try to pull me into my closet with her. id follow her into the closet at first, but then shed show me this little door at the back of the closet, and my heart would start to race. i dont know what it was about that door, but i knew something bad would happen if i went through it. id start to struggle and try to pull away, but the doll was too strong and would start pulling me through the door. at this point in the dream, id always wake up screaming. the worst part was i had night terrors, so sometimes id wake up standing next to my closet. every night before bed, id make my parents make sure there wasnt a little door at the back of my closet. there never was. anyway, i was talking to my mom the other day and this dream came up. im laughing about it and how ridiculously paranoid i was about dolls and that closet, but my mom gets really quiet. she tells me the creepy part of that dream wasnt the doll; it was the fact that there used to be a little door at the back of the closet, but when i was one year old, they remodeled the house and put a wall where the door used to be. theres no way i could have remembered that door, but years later, i kept dreaming about it. none of my friends believe this story, but i swear its true.	2227	41514	bt3zc7	eouj2s2
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i grew up on a 2 acre home with plenty of trees and room for an 8 yr old to run around. our house also was heated in winter by a wood fireplace, so we would periodically cut down one of our own trees to save money. well for about 2 years, there was a stump less then a foot tall near the house, and at least once a day, without fail, i would see someone standing on the stump. usually it was out of the corner of my eye, but once or twice i looked directly at him. i always looked away quickly, cuz it startled me and he was gone, but my sister says she experienced the same thing. nothing ever came of it tho	613	41514	bt3zc7	eou7lyz
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	growing up, i had a friend named adam. he was never able to come out dyeing the day, only right before all of us kids had to go home for the evening. adam lived a few houses over, in a house with an overgrown yard. i met his parents once. they were very strange, didn't smile, and obviously didn't want me there. i remember adam telling me that he was sick, that's why he couldn't play that much. he was a small boy, pale with dark hair. eventually, adam stopped showing up all together. and i eventually moved on, though i do remember going to his house a couple times to see if he could come play, and his dad just gave me this look before closing the door in my face. later in life, i asked my sister if she remembered him. she doesn't, and according to my parents - that house was empty the entire time we lived there. i don't know who adam was, i don't know why i so vividly remember him and his parents. as far as i can tell, he wasn't real - and yet i have perfect memories of him and his parents.	277	41514	bt3zc7	eoulfd5
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	alright, buckle in. my neighbor was dying of a heart condition about 6 years ago. he knew he was, so he was giving away his valuables to people he trusted with them. neighbor gave me his tackle box. he loved to fish. i would see him come home from fishing every day and hed just sit on his porch and skin fish. i just put the tackle box in my closet and didnt really do anything with it since i dont fish. anyways, soon after, he passed away in his home. exactly a week after that, i woke up to the tackle box at the foot of my bed. weird, but my stepdad likes to dick around, figured it was him, so i put it back. the next morning, i wake up, its at the foot of my bed again. so, i ask my stepdad what the deal was, and he had no idea what i was talking about. to test this, i put the tackle box in a spot that he wouldnt find, nor would he attempt to get it. under my bed, all the way in the back against the wall, and i put stuff in front of it to conceal it. next morning, nothing. okay, i guess it was him. didnt give it much thought after that. 3 days pass, i wake up one morning and there it is, at the foot of my bed. fuck. now im starting to freak out. so i did what any rational person would and i went fishing with it. after i went fishing, i put the tackle box away, and it hasnt moved since then. its still there.	2278	41514	bt3zc7	eoukzoc

"just after high school, maybe six months or so after 9-11, i was a van driver who drove the meals for meals on wheels to the place where they get packaged up and taken for home delivery. anyway the delivery van only had am/fm radio and i was listening to 92.5 fm, when all of a sudden the station cuts out and a transmition that i can only describe as an american version of a numbers station began playing. it was seemingly random nymbers followed by a long period of the same phrase repeated over and over again. the phrase was ""they took the crosstown bus"", over and over again. none of the other drivers heard it but man was it creepy to hear. eventually the regular radio station came back on and they never mentioned anything about it."	7944	41514	bt3zc7	eoucln6
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this happened to me last year and i fully understand why no one believed me because it sounds rediculous. every morning, i need to wake up at 5 am to get the 5:30 bus to the train station to go to university. i had to be there by 8 am, but i like to get there half an hour early. to get to the bus stop, i have to walk down this bike path and under this bridge to get to this quiet backstreet road. there is fuck all light on the bike path. this street is dead quiet. the right side of the road is a continuation of the bike path, and the left is a normal footpath with a long green hedge. one morning, i was standing there waiting for a bus and this old women comes walking out from under the bridge. i didn't see her at first because as i said it was pitch black on the bike path. she crosses the road and walks up to me. she asked me if i knew where x road was. i turned to point in the direction of the road she was looking for. i turned back and she was gone. this old women who was walking at a snails pace dissapeared within 3 seconds.	600	41514	bt3zc7	eoue89j

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	about 8 years ago now i was taking a drive out to kansas from the east coast. i was with a friend and we were going out to see her grandparents. once we were about 2 hours from the grandparents house my friend starts outlining standard operating procedures of seeing things in and around her familys home. she seemed a bit panicky when going over everything but i managed to calm her down. im skeptical of everything and assured her that the things she had seen when she was a small child were just manufactured in her imagination. she insisted that the entire family had seen these things with the exception of her grandparents. 2 hours later, we arrive in kansas and im ready to fall over because of the length of time the last leg of the trip took. we are welcomed and grandmother takes me to a back bedroom and just as she about to close the door; she stops, says maybe you shouldnt stay in this room and escorts me to another room. ok, that was a little strange but whatever, im tired. fast forward to night #2 at the grandparents home. its around 11pm and my friend is crashed out on the couch watching tv. im in an adjacent bedroom from which i can see her laying on the couch. i nod off for the night and wake up to a old grey man that bared a resemblance to the grandfather but was not the grandfather standing with his back to me in the doorway looking at my friend sleeping on the couch. i decided i was going to get up and confront the old grey man and something slammed me back into the bed. i tried to get up several more times with the same result. each time i was slammed back into the bed a voice would repeat put a seal on the door finally, i snapped to its 3 am and everything was normal. i must have been sleeping. it was a dream. no old grey man and my friend was fast asleep. so i start pacing around the room trying to decide how i feel about what had just happened. i glance over to my friend her eyes are open and she says you seen it. i say, get in the car, i cant be here right now. we spend the next 4 hours sitting in a walmart parking lot talking about the history of her experiences in that house and comparing to my own. ok, my nerves are not on fire anymore and we are heading back to the grandparents home. we arrive and they are waiting for us inside. i tell them exactly what happened to me and i get yeah, thats strange. we usually do seal our doors with a prayer at night but with all the excitement we just must have forgotten. all the children have mentioned stories of things but we have never seen them. we are sorry you had to go through that. im really not sure what i seen or experienced that night but when i tell people they get that look of skepticism. its obvious they dont believe me. my conclusion is that the experience was indistinguishable from reality in the moment. i dont know what that means but it changed the way i look at things.	537	41514	bt3zc7	eouklks
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this was 4 years ago. as i was walking on the sidewalk on a busy afternoon, i saw a suspicious boy/man about 18 yo. he was 10 meters away and walking what it looked like towards me. i kept my eyes on him despite the fact that he wasnt looking directly at me, his eyes were roaming jumping from an object to an object. as we approached one another, half a meter away from each other he takes out a knife and tries to stab me in my left side. he wasnt really fast, so i easily dodged it and immediately turn to see who is he, or if he is trying to stab me again. to my surprise he continues walking and after couple of meters he stopes turns around smiles and gives me thumbs up, then he continues walking in the opposite direction. till this day i dont know who he was, what he wanted and even my family doesnt believe me, because if someone wanted to stab you, you cant stop him. you arent experienced enough to dodge it like that and something of that kind. edit: thank you for the rewards! those are my first ones so i dont know what do they do. thank you!!!!	2863	41514	bt3zc7	eoubqyu
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i woke up to something, it sounded like a door shutting. at first i thought it was a dream because i could hear it in the dream as i was waking up, kinda like when someone calls your name when youre dreaming. but then i looked at my cat, his hair was completely standing up and he was beaming at my bedroom door. this was the moment when i got really scared bc i know animals can pick up on that shit and i thought he might know somethings wrong. my cat doesnt do this type of thing unless a dog is in the room. so i looked over at the door and the only way i can describe it is it looked like it was swaying, slowly, like it was breathing, like someone was standing on the other side of it trying to hear if i was awake. this swaying was accompanied by a shadow. *i dont mean a supernatural shadow, but it looked like the shadow of a person behind the door. i was paralyzed in fear. i lied there for 5 minutes naked watching this door away. i considered yelling and trying to scare them away but i was terrified someone might respond. i legitimately thought this was the moment where i will have to defend myself or be killed. i dont own a gun but after 10 minutes or so i mustered up the courage to check every room in the house. i fucking checked every corner too. but there was no one there. i dont know what happened, but my evolutionary traits kicked in and i completely believed someone was outside my door. edit: the, accompanied by a shadow part was not a shadow figure, it was like the shadow youd see if something was on the other side of a cracked door. i dont know if that makes the story less scary or what, but just wanted to be clear.	9107	41514	bt3zc7	eou86yl
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"this makes me sound fucking crazy but anyways: &#x200b; it was a warm summer morning back when i was a kid. i was standing in our hallway, putting on my shoes when i randomly peeked into our living room and saw a see-through male figure surrounded by rainbow coloured light standing right in the middle of the living room. he was reading a book and didn't seem to notice me. i thought it was weird but i didn't feel scared or anything. it felt like the room was filled with a warm, loving energy if that makes sense. i kinda just shrugged it off and went about my day, probably because i was too young to really understand what i'd seen. a few days later when my mom tucked me into bed she read me a bedtime story about a kid who meets an angel or something like that, don't remember the story exactly but what is interesting is the authors description of what that angel looked like. it was exactly the same as the strange rainbow man i had seen in our living room a couple of days before. it even said that angels will often visit humans surrounded by a strong, rainbow coloured lightening and manifest themselves while reading a book*.* &#x200b; i casually blurted out:""*oh, i've seen an angel then!""* and my mom was like:""*you have? that's great!""* and we didn't talk more about that for a while until one day where i randomly asked my mom if i could see a picture of my grandad who died unexpectedly while my mom was pregnant with me.she found an old family album and we looked through pictures of my parents' wedding that happened exactly one year before i was born. there was a picture of three or four people sitting together, laughing and having a great time at the party. i immediately pointed out the guy who sat in the middle and said:*""how funny! he looks just like the angel i saw!!""* and my moms face turned white as a ghost. she was just about to tell me that this was indeed my deceased grandfather who i never got to meet. i'm very convinced it was him visiting me."	614	41514	bt3zc7	eoucs1m
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i spent one summer in high school living with my aunt and uncle and keeping their seven year old daughter for them during the day while they worked. i was up late one night watching tv in the living room. the living room was right off of the kitchen, separated only by an l shaped bar. i saw my cousin, out of the corner of my eye, walk down the hallway from her room into the kitchen. it was way past her bedtime, so i told her she needed to go back to bed. when i didnt hear her answer, i got up and walked around the bar and into the kitchen. there was no one there. i checked under the bar to see if she was hiding from me, and there was no one there, and no where else she couldve gone from the kitchen. i walked down the hallway to her room, and she was fast asleep, snoring, so there was no way it was her. it baffled me, and freaked me out, because if i didnt see my cousin, who was the little girl that walked into the kitchen? several years later, i was talking to my aunt and she nonchalantly brings up the ghost in her house. i laughed it off and she said, no, im serious. we have a ghost. your uncle and i both have seen her and heard her. we call her giggles, because we hear her giggling. we usually only see her in the hallway before she disappears. all of a sudden, i remembered the disappearing girl in the kitchen. i asked her what her ghost looked like. she said she had blonde hair with braids and wore a white dress. my cousin is blonde. on the night in question, i thought id seen my cousin in a nightgown walk down the hallway, but apparently it was the ghost that resides in my aunts house.	1163	41514	bt3zc7	eou6z6e
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"fishing on lake minnewanka in banff national park with a good freind. about 50 feet from shore. around 8:30 pm i see glowing red eyes. up in the trees. like . red. like predator i guess. i do a double - take. they are gone. i decide not to say anything, maybe i'm trippin. did just smoke up. nope. 5 mins later my buddy says ""i just seen some glowing red eyes up in the top of those trees."" i feel goosebumps. ""yup, i saw them too"". we look back and they are gone. we decide to aim the boat towards the shoreline. it's not dark yet but sun is going down. we saw nothing. no owls, no goats in the trails. we didn't get off the boat but we had a good look around. when i ask him about it (this was around 10 years ago) he just says he doesn't want to talk about it. i can't blame him. but after all these years i've never heard or seen anything like those glowing red eyes, 30 - 40 feet up in the trees. staring at us. i copied and pasted this next part, i knew nothing about the history when we went fishing there. ""for more than 100 centuries, people hunted and camped along the original shores of lake minnewanka. the stoney people called it minn-waki or lake of the spirits. they respected and feared this lake for its resident spirits. the early europeans called it devil's lake."" i used to go camping there. i do not any more. mostly because it's bear country for most of the summer. but yeah also because of those bright red eyes. i will never forget that. most surreal thing i've ever seen."	4184	41514	bt3zc7	eou2og1

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i used to have a buddy that lived in the same neighborhood, a few streets over. one night we were having a couple of beers in his backyard while playing cards. i had some things to do the next morning so just before ten i said my good-byes and shoved off. it was a short walk (maybe 15 minutes door-to-door) so i never drove. anyway, it was a nice night. uneventful trip. but when i got home, my roommate was coming out the front door, coffee in hand, and dressed for work. he gave me a funny look and said he thought i was asleep since my truck was in the driveway. i told him where i'd been and asked why he was going in to work at night. that's when he kind of laughed and asked if i was drunk. we stared at each other for a minute and then he told me it was just after 5 in the morning and he was going in just like he usually did. in my entire life, i'd never felt more confused than i did in that moment. i could tell he was dead serious but i knew i had just left my friend's house. i checked my phone and sure enough. 5-something in the am. my roommate left for work. i paced circles in the living room for a bit then called the friend whose house i'd just left. he groggily answered and confirmed i'd left at ten the previous evening. i have no idea what happened during those 7 hours of my life and it gives me chills to think about it all these years later. i wasn't drunk, i wasn't tired, no one could have slipped anything in either of the two coors lights i'd had.no known medical conditions that would have caused me to blackout, and nothing has happened like it since. i just don't know what happened to that time.	45827	41514	bt3zc7	eotzubs
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not quite sure how young i was at the time but it was probably between 5-8. i was in my babysitter bed at the time in her trailer park. it was 3:00am i had woken up because i had to pee. when i woke up i looked down the hallway to see my babysitter leaning against the wall like one of the stereotypical cool guys do in movies. and i made eye contact and i felt my body go cold because she was still sound asleep next to me in bed. i went under the blankets trying to hide and when i looked back she was gone. i didnt want to sound crazy so ive never told anyone. i just sat in her bed watching infomercials until 6:00am when she woke up. never even thought about sleeping there again. i honestly forget how much this affected me until i started writing this. really freaked me out man. edit: since i never told anyone idk if it belongs here, but no one in my family believes in ghost, so if i were to tell them i guarantee itd be dismissed.	12952	41514	bt3zc7	eotvvlf
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	two stories here, both about my grandma. near the end my grandma had trouble controlling her bowels, wore a diaper and would typically go all over the toilet. after she passed(she passed in the house under professional care) my family cleaned out the house, took the wallpaper down, cleaned the place spotless, because we were going to move in in the next month or two. about a week after we finished cleaning we went back to make sure everything was good, we get to the bathroom my grandma used and there was literal shit everywhere, the walls, the ceiling, behind the shower curtain, literally the entire bathroom was essentially coated. freaked me out because i knew it had to be my grandma, no burst pipes or anything wrong with the plumbing. second story: we ended up moving in after the shituation. my parents were out of town, so my brother and i had some friends over, we were in the basement playing magic the gathering when i went upstairs to grab everyone drinks. in line of sight from the fridge was the tv in our family room, out of nowhere the tv turns on full volume to the show the commissioner, which was my grandmas favorite show, she was also hard of hearing so it being at full volume was normal for her. i freaked the fuck out and ran into the basement to get my brother, we go upstairs and the tv is off but the recliner is reclined. i shouldnt have been scared because it had to be my grandma, but i young. we lived in that house a few more years and a few other things happened but those two stick out to me because they were so close to when she died	977	41514	bt3zc7	eouf8t5
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i was walking to class from the dining hall on my campus when i saw a lady yelling for help and banging on a window of a nearby building. lots of people were walking past but i was the only one who seemed to acknowledge it. i went to the window to help and she told me she was locked in a room in the building and that she needed me to come in and open the door. now, i have no idea the layout of this building and where she was located. so i decided to call campus security for help despite her pleading with me not to call them and to just let her out. i call them and when i hear them coming i go to greet them so i can take them to the window. i leave for maybe a maximum of fifteen seconds and when i return with campus security she is gone. we can't see her at the window and campus security goes inside to double check and sure enough there is no trace of her. campus security definitely thought i was crazy and i'm sure my professor thought i was full of shit when i explained to him why i was late. no one seems to believe me that this happened but i swear it did. faqs: i am female/it is a very old campus with lots of random historic buildings that people don't really use and this building was one of them/the area has a very high crime rate so it probably was a robbery	26449	41514	bt3zc7	eotveh8
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ooh! i have a story. my husband(then bf) and i were laying on his trampoline one night looking up at the stars and shit when all of a sudden a chunk of the sky starts moving/billowing. it looked like a green screen shifting, and had to be a few miles wide. we both saw it and still have no fucking idea what it could have been.	143	41514	bt3zc7	eouafg8
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ok so i was flicking through these and told my girlfriend about one and she hit me up with these stories. just some background she is a dedicated science brain and not superstitious at all. when she was growing up (~4 to ~15 years of age) she would often wake up in the middle of a disturbed sleep to see an old women perched at the end of her bed. this women was not someone that she recognised. the old lady would sooth her back to sleep often patting her feet at the end of her bed. the strange thing about this is her sister (a few years older) also had similar experiences seeing the old lady. they both shared a room, but would see her at different times. we doubt very much it was someone coming into their rooms at night. both her and the sister also recalled seeing a man popping his head out from behind their tall kitchen cupboard, smiling and then going back behind it. turns out that from his description the family believed it was a neighbour who passed away and used to play hide and seek with them and his children. personally, i've never experienced anything supernatural. found reading this thread and talking to her about it very interesting :). edit: thanks for all the votes and comments. one of my first big posts on reddit great seeing the love! we both woke up all giddy. my gf divulged further that the house they lived in used to be owned by and elderly women who kept it super clean and was a very caring member of the community. apparently she died 3 days after they signed the lease.	3019	41514	bt3zc7	eouagvc
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"this might end up buried but i'm going to add it anyways. i work night shift at a hospital and during the night it's fairly common for us to run out of particular supplies that we need. during the day, there is normally a worker from central supply that you can call and they'll bring up what you need directly to your floor. but at night, we don't have that luxury so we often have to go down and get it ourselves. central supply is the basement of this hospital that has been around since the 40's, so it's creepy enough. i had heard stories about how creepy it was and people getting uneasy feelings while down there alone. i was naive and didn't really believe it until one night i had to go down there by myself. the place is huge and dimly lit with rows of shelves of hospital supplies everywhere. i'm in the middle of these shelves looking for what i need when i just start to feel a shiver run through my entire body. the hair on my neck is standing up and i just get this feeling of complete dread, like i'm not supposed to be there. then all of a sudden i see this black figure dart passed me out of the corner of my eye. at first i thought i was just seeing things because it's like 3am and i'm tired so i brush it off. i go to leave and suddenly i hear a huge crash behind me. a variety of supplies were wiped completely off the shelf and all over the floor and in the corner of the room, i just see this black figure like thing standing there. every hair on my body is standing up at this point and i get my ass out of that place as fast as possible. i came back to my floor and all but one of my coworkers thought i was bluffing. the only one who believed me saw my face and without me saying anything said to me, ""you saw it too, didn't you?"" &#x200b; yeah, i never went down in the basement ever again lol. edit: grammar, inevitably due to writing this during night shift lmfao"	716	41514	bt3zc7	eouek7z
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not sure if it counts as creepy or overall scary, but it was weird. back in high school i lived in a large apartment complex, it was maybe around 8-9 at night and completely dark. i was with a group of friends 4 or 5 people, we were just talking and messing around with a friends pair of walkie talkies as we decided to look up in the sky as 2 fireballs or what can be described as fireballs just appear in the sky and slowly move in a line, just as that happened we started getting what sounded like military communication over said walkie talkies that was really static but words came in every now and then. about 10 or so mins later the fireballs disappeared and the communication cut out. there was absolutely nothing about this on the news the next morning, and no one ever believed me. edit: the sky was clear, no clouds, and the only military base in my whole state was 30ish miles away. luke afb	9557	41514	bt3zc7	eotseuc
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	footsteps and banging in my attic. for about 2 months, almost every night i would hear from my attic (the steps are only like 5 feet from my room) small taps or footsteps. then it gradually got louder to the point it sounded like an audible foot was pressing on the wood. i told my dad and he told me it wad probably an animal that got up there or something. thing is, my sister heard it too as her bedroom was in the same hallway as mine. my dad might've been right as it was completely gone after 2-3 months and right now at 2 am, i don't hear it. and i swear to god if i hear it after i post this i'm actually gonna piss my pants. edit: a commentor also reminded me that about 3 times i heard a loud bang, like something knocking really loud on the roof. my heart would skip a beat when that happened. i'm so fucking relieved whatever was up there is gone now or else i felt like i woulda gone crazy.	12831	41514	bt3zc7	eotvtg7
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"no one ever believes me when i tell them this except the few people that are involved. my dad thinks we are just to imaginative even though my mom and i will tell the exact same stories at different times, never having talk to each other but any way here's what i have to contribute it's a copy&paste btw. i've told this story on reddit before my story starts when i was roughly 8. my parents bought an old farm house that's over 100 years old ( we found news paper clippings in the wall when they renovated it from 1864). i had 2 brothers at the time and we were all outside playing and they had a tendency to pick on me, so i decided i was done putting up with it and went in the house to tattle (as year olds do). i yelled several times for my mom and finally got back. "" what is it dear*?"" not seeing her i yell ""where are you?"" again i hear a voice ""i'm over here dere."" i dont see her and call out again. this repeats about 4 times and as i get closer and the voice gets louder. i passed by a window and glanced out to see my mom and dad out in the distance working on a tractor. my heart jumps into my throat and i book it outside. my brothers are exactly where they were when i went in so i know it's not one of them messing with me. throughout the years i hear voices and tv's and strange noises constantly throughout the house but just assume i'm hearing things move up a bit to me being 17. parents left town for a few days and i had some friends come over. night starts off normal we play some video games and all is well. 2 of my friends need to use the bathroom so one goes down stairs and one stays upstairs since theres 2 bathrooms in the house. first friend comes back from the bathroom and says "" yea yes really funny guys"" to the 3 of us that are in the room. we have no idea what he talking about. he said ""banging on the door and making weird sounds while i'm taking a piss, soooooo funny."" we are all genuinely confused as we haven't moved. he doesn't believe us but sits down and rejoins the group. now the second friend comes back from downstairs and has a similar complaint. he says we were bouncing a ball, shuffling things around laughing outside the door and heard us run off when the toilet flushed. we again are confused especially since there weren't enough of us to mess with both of them at the same time. conversation kind of drops but neither seem convinced we did nothing a couple hours go by and for some reason the conversation comes up again. we deny it they dpnt believe it. eventually that turns into jokes a out ghosts and how we disturbed them when the house was remodeled(i was about 13 when we started remodeling). jokes continue and someone said, "" ah come on now you cant really believe that ghosts exist?"" and everyone is like nahh they probably dont. on the other side of the room is a single-fold closet door and right as we said that this door explodes open so violently that the folds slam together and bounce almost back shut. we immediately end that conversation, flip every light in the house on and no one dared to touch that door. the next day i wanted to make sure something didnt fall, but as i open the door there is nothing close to the door a d nothing big enough that even could have fallen to slam that door open. move forward to me being 20 and telling my mom of the weird things that i witnessed. she tells me "" oh i know theres at least a family of 3 that i know of. 2 little boys one always has a bouncing ball and the other giggles a lot and an old man"" i hadn't even gotten to that part in my story. edit:dear* cause apparently this is a hot button issue for y'all"	6058	41514	bt3zc7	eotxcsx

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was around 9 or 10, this guy who looked about 40 just kept being in every single public place i was in. with my parents or not, he was there. at the store? yes he was there, bought everything me and my family bought. in school? yes, he was staring at me on the other side of the school gate. out in the city? yes, following me in the streets. i told my parents so many times and they just ignored me and said i need to stop believing everything my brother says. (since my brother was really into creepy stuff at the time, he was 14) one day this guy just disappeared. the next thing i knew was that one of my friends kept seeing the guy everywhere. she many times pointed that the guy was outside the school gate watching her, i never saw him on the otherside of the gate. then she told me the guy disappeared after a few weeks. then this other kid started telling everyone about the guy following him. about 7 months passed and i moved to another town. still gives me creeps. edit: for the people asking what he looked like, he was a ginger head, not really good looking :/ and that's all i remember.	16055	41514	bt3zc7	eotz5to

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"about a decade ago, i was helping my sister and her husband move into their new apartment. it was in a far off city, so i couldn't exactly drive home right after we were done, and their place was also pretty cramped. i decided to spend the weekend at her friend's (who i'll call mary) house for my bus back home on monday. now, mary is a widow. i'm also a guy. keep that in mind. when i first got to mary's house, i was immediately hit by how unwelcoming the place felt. she was really nice, but the house just ""felt"" angry, as if i was an intruder. the building was also ice cold despite it being summer and there being no ac. it was off putting to say the least but i just chalked it up to nerves. mary starts to show me around the house, but a feeling of profound unease begins to steadily creep up on me, starting right in my gut. something is seriously off about this place, but i don't know what exactly. one room was her husband's study. it looked completely untouched since what i was guessing was the time of his death: files, books, computer and keyboard, pens and pencils, and even a coffee mug. all of it was covered in some serious dust. the room didn't look exactly ominous but it was certainly bizarre. she finally leads me to the guest room and i start to get ready to turn in. it's about 11 pm. i leave the one luggage bag i brought on the floor, change into my pajamas, lay in bed and try to get to sleep. a few hours later at about 1 or 1:30, i wake up to what sounds like footsteps. i don't worry too much about it, thinking it's probably mary on her way to the bathroom or something. then something hits me like a brick. these footsteps are far too deep and far too loud to belong to mary. they sound like the footsteps of a bigger guy. now, i'm sweating bullets but all i can really do is stay still and try to go back to sleep. for good while, all i can hear is the steady pacing of a large man just outside the door. i swear, at some moments it felt like whatever the fuck it was, was walking right into the room. i eventually fall back asleep. i wake up again at about 3 or 3:30. this time it felt like someone or something was pinning the covers from below the bed so that i couldn't move. i'm terrified and almost paralyzed in fear. after a few moments of struggling, i manage to get the covers off and then the bed starts to violently shake. i grab my phone and fucking take off. i hustle down the stairs in my pjs and call a taxi to get to a hotel since i'm way too spooked to stay any longer. once i get off the phone, i quickly go back into the house to get my stuff from the guest room. i will never forget what i saw next. as i open the door to my room, to my total and utter horror, i see that my luggage has been carefully placed on my bed, opened, and the contents have been completely strewn about. i practically shit a brick, scramble to get my stuff into my bag, and sprint out of the house. i haven't been over at mary's house since edit 1: formatting, spelling, and some extra deets edit 2: i never spoke to mary about this in detail, but she did ask me why i left in such a hurry. i told her that i couldn't sleep since the house was so cold. she clearly wasn't believing me, but we both just silently agreed to let it slide. i'd later find out from my sister (who i also did not tell very much to) that mary's husband had killed himself in the guest room."	4342	41514	bt3zc7	eou3tme

"i guess this isn't super scary, and idk if it really fits, but it still weirds me out and my friends just think i'm crazy. back when i was a freshman in college i went out with a friend of mine. he ended up dancing with some girl, so i went and grabbed a seat at the bar. girl came up to me and bought me a drink because she ""liked my style"" and introduced herself as sapphire. we chatted for at least an hour, had a few drinks, and at some point she said she had to leave, so i asked for her number and she scribbled it on to a bar napkin. but then we ended up chatting more and one thing led to another and she invited me to her apartment. we go there and start hooking up and she asks if i've ever tried acid and if i wanted to do some. i said sure. after it kicks in we go for a walk, we were talking about the constellations and space for a while, but then i noticed she got quiet. i had my eyes glued to the sky for the entire walk, so i look over. and she's gone. i freak out and start retracing my steps to get back to her place, yelling her name and checking bushes (my high ass assumed she was just peeing in a bush). get back to her apartment, knock on the door, and some guy answers the door. keep in mind this was like 4am at this point. some guy answers and i ask if he knew sapphire and described her. he said he had no clue who i was talking about and to just go home. so i did, i ended up crashing at a friend's place because my trip was going south and i knew he'd be able to calm me down. next day comes and i'm still trying to figure out what happened to her. i call the number she gave me. it was disconnected. went back to the apartment, same guy answers, still no idea what i'm talking about. even knocked on some of the neighbors, and tried the same room location on different floors. nothing. talked to the security guy at the front desk, said he remembers me coming in a few times, but never saw me with a girl. called up my friend who was at the bar with me and asked if he saw the girl i was with. he said he never saw me with a girl, according to him i was sitting at the bar alone for a bit, had a few drinks, and left after like 30 minutes. i have no idea who this woman was, or if she even existed, but i remember her so vividly i can't believe that i imagined it. she just vanished, i have no tangible proof of her existence. freaks me out to this day that i spent an entire night with this person who didn't exist. i still don't know what happened that night."	8920	41514	bt3zc7	eouc713
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i was at this scene of a suicide(work related). guy shot him self with a shotgun, right under the chin. when i walked in, a black cat was sitting in his blood and staring at me. really weird. edit: for the ones calling bullshit, thats cool lol. the wife called us. his wife and kid came running out of the house past me as i got there. the detectives came out after the fact. and it was his own cat.	14666	41514	bt3zc7	eou2cgp
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not really creepy or scary but my parents went canoeing in the middle of nowhere with some troubled youth. while they were on the river their canoes capsized and people were having problems swimming and getting to shore. about 3-4 large men came out of no where and helped them all to shore then completely disappeared afterwards. my parents swear they must of been angels as theres no way they appeared and disappeared that quickly when they were in the middle of nowhere.	5812	41514	bt3zc7	eou6sq7
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	as a marine, i used to have the graveyard patrol shift at the beirut bombing memorial. part of the memorial is dedicated to a veteran's cemetary. oddly enough i never got freaked out being completely alone in a remote cemetery, in the middle of the night, surrounded by dense woods on all sides. it was actually kind of peaceful, to be honest. however, one night i was patrolling near the perimeter fence where some of the oldest headstones are, when i heard the sound of a woman humming. i followed the sound and noticed a light glowing through the vines and brush of a large tree. as i approached, i could literally feel my hair beginning to lift as if there was an electric current in the air. i pushed aside the brush and what i saw nearly took my breath away. it was an old, weathered headstone with a large cross etched into the marble. only the cross was glowing a bright, vivid blue, like a neon bulb. the humming was also suddenly much louder and had a weird plurality to it, like it was coming from hundreds of voices at once. needless to say, i freaked the fuck out. i screamed like a scared little girl and sprinted back to the parking lot. i radioed the guard who was supposed to relieve me and forced him to come early, then spent the rest of my shift in the cab of his truck. i don't think he believed me, but he stayed in his truck and didn't go out on patrol until the sun was fully up. a few days later, i worked up the nerve to return to the grave (during the day, of course). as i suspected, in the light of day it was a completely mundane headstone. there was no name, only the aforementioned cross. i ran my hands over the stone and checked to see if maybe there was some sort of hidden light source or solar panel, but no, it was just plain, solid, unremarkable stone. the humming was gone, too. i eventually returned to my normal shift, but never again experienced anything out of the ordinary. i never learned whose grave that was, either, but i find myself thinking about it from time to time. it certainly sounds absurd when i say it out loud, and i suppose it could have been a hallucination or a trick of my tired brain, but i don't believe it was. i think it was real; a ghost or spirit of some sort, but i don't think it was malevolent at all.	245	41514	bt3zc7	eouik55
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"this may be long and it isn't a ""no one believes me/us"" scenario due to the amount of us involved, more of ""a lot of skepticism"" thing. back story: (you'll need it) i grew up in a small california desert tourist town called joshua tree. home of the joshua tree national park (those of us that are older call it ""the monument"" as it was that before national parkdom). i was in my early 20's at the time of this, which was approximately 14 years ago, and was the only one with a car and a license. growing up in a small desert town leaves you will limited options for fun and we would make use of the park. occasionally, maybe once a week or so, a group of us would pile in to the station wagon with beer, smokes and a mix tape and drive through the park late at night. an empty road, so dark and quite other than the loud group of guys in a red mercury driving fast from one enterance to another. hours would go by each time as we drove the long desolate road and stopped at various rocks we liked to climb. and i can't understate how desolate it was. how alone. no other cars, no lights. except the occasional road work sign when warranted. hell, that was exactly what we thought it was. this trip started like every other, except maybe more of us than usual. crammed in that car, windows down as i chain smoked and drove a good 20mph over the speed limit, gravel spitting up as we had a good time. shortly in to the trip i saw a light. a blue light. possibly (and it was) miles and miles ahead. that is the thing about dark, light is free to shine. i remember saying something about having to slow down at some point ahead, must be some road construction left by itself up ahead. had to be a sign, the light hadn't moved. we continued for a few miles to one of our favorite stops and got out. we climbed for a while, maybe 45 minutes or so. drank a little. joked. the norm. then we piled back in and continued. let me be clear, this light never moved and we had already been about an hour in to our adventure. why would the sign have a blue light?? as we approached the light i started to slow. and slowed more and more as we approached the source. it wasn't a sign, it wasn't a car, it wasn't a ufo. standing on the side of the road, facing towards us unmoving for over an hour at this point, was a man. a pale white man, white beard, dirty old miner clothing with an old mining helmet and a pickaxe. his light giving off an unnatural blue light. his face blank but he stared at us, directly at all of us. we sped up and as we drove by faster, his head turning to keep pace with us as we left. his light visible, unmoving once again, facing us the entire trip out. i remember looking at the car clock shortly after passing him, it was damn near exactly 1:00 am when we passed him. we never saw a car, hell. a horse, any way for this old sickly pale miner to get in to the park, nor any reason for him to be there. worst of all we estimated that this miner had to have been standing there, facing us, for at least an hour and a half never moving. not once did that light flicker as if he looked down for a moment, or turned his head. he just stood there staring down a road at a car full of dumbasses. we never saw him again. however, a couple of years ago i decided to check to see if anyone experienced the same. i found one other story of a couple that saw him near where we did. standing there, staring late at night. as a man i wish we would have stopped. even if it would have been the most horrifying thing ever, i wish we would have stopped because i honestly believe there was a ghost of a dead miner out in that park and i would know for sure today."	1623	41514	bt3zc7	eou61bl

"ah!! i wrote about this a while ago. none of my family really believes me, everyone just dismissed me as ""imagining things."" copy and pasting below. *** so i was getting on the elevator in the metro. to get from the train platform to the main platform with the turnstiles and exit, you have to take the elevator. so i got on with this older guy, it was just us two. and i glanced over and this guy was watching me. pointedly. and he was smiling but not in a nice, welcoming way. you know in cliche creepy pastas where they talk about monsters with ""unnaturally wide smiles""? that's exactly the kind of smile this guy had. anyway, i looked away from him because i thought he was just crazy or something. but out of the corner of my eye, i saw him making these weird gestures all over his chest. it almost looked like he was making the sign of the cross or something. finally, the elevator doors opened and we both got off and walked towards the turnstiles. i swiped my card to exit and then turned around to see if this dude was following me. and he was. gone. there was nowhere else he could have gone, we were at the only exit for the station. unless he turned back, ran and got on another elevator in about four seconds. i don't know. i don't know where the fuck he went. anyway. i'm from a small town and sometimes weird things happen in the city that i don't quite understand but i just chalk it up to me being practically a redneck. but this was. really out there. and it's been bothering me. anyway. there we go, that's all. thanks for reading."	7812	41514	bt3zc7	eotpojp
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	we had this punching bag (on the ground, not hanging on the air) that we took the bag off of, leaving only the thing that brings the punching bag back to you. we were wondering what to do with it. the next few days, my mom was doing some arts and crafts project (she was big on it lately) and made this dragon head. she called it george and hung it on that punching bag thing. when i slept, it was directly in my eyesight if i looked through my bedroom door. sometimes, when i was having trouble sleeping, i could swear that the head turned 90 degrees to look directly at me. when i blinked, it was back to normal. this happened many times over the course of 4 years before george started falling apart. i was happy, but my mom was sad. even when i told her what i saw, she thought i was just having bad dreams. i'm sure that dragon head was looking straight at me.	3320	41514	bt3zc7	eotv6p5
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"on mobile, so i apologize beforehand. it's kinda a long one, it'll be my first long post, so i hope you enjoy. tl;dr at the bottom. my mom runs an antique business and has for years. i've worked with her on various occasions, often changing between working the shop with her and doing construction with my dad. for awhile, she ran her business a few towns over with my best friend's dad, and the business was ok, but didn't make enough to support the both of them. well, a few years back, she sold her ownership to him, and just boxed up some of her things from the shop to bring home. my dad, however, surprised her and rented her a building in our home town so she could run her own shop. she quickly brought everything there and began unpacking. while unpacking, i found an old ouiji board from an estate sale she had bought out. i showed her, we joked about the creepyness of it, and she said when she'd gotten it, her coworker had jokingly played with it to tease her (our family isn't super religious, but we ain't about tempting demons lol). she thought he'd thrown it away, but apparently he'd snuck it into her stuff as a final prank. so, we laughed, and she tossed it in the garbage pile. a few months later, i was running the front desk when she brought a box of antiques to price down from the attic. we began going through it and what happened to be in the bottom of the box? the ouiji board, still in it's cardboard case, planchette underneath. i recognized it as the same one (the box had the same tears and dents i remembered). mom and i looked at each other, and after much debating, threw it away. again. well, in about 2017, mom stopped opening the shop (we weren't making too much while open), and instead started buying out estate sales or helping them run it, then buying what was left over to take to the shop (which we still owned). it became a storage house for antiques she hoped to one day sell. this last week (may 20th i believe?) she asked me to help buckle down and clear out damaged junk from the shop. we began going through boxes and boxes and moving them to a trailer to take to a garage sale location. as i was shuffling a box through to the back area to load it, i heard my mother shout, ""no. f***ing. way."" i thought maybe she'd been bitten by a spider or found something valuable, so i set the box down and rushed back to her. what i saw sent a chill down my spine. in the back room where she was, the back wall was lined with shelves, and there were clothing racks and boxes of clothes stacked in front of it. after moving the boxes, the shelves were in clear view. most were cluttered with knick knacks or such. but on the bottom shelf, centered and all alone there sat a familiar board-game sized cardboard box. we stared at it, then each other. neither of us said a word. we pulled it out and sure enough, it was the same damned box. the corners were torn. the sides were scratched. same one. i'd seen it thrown out twice before, yet here it was. we tried to tell my dad, but he isn't superstitious. my brother didn't believe us. they assume it's a separate game, and part of me wants to think so too. but i've seen that box too closely too many times. i know it's the same one. tl;dr - mom opens her own antique shop and we find a ouiji board and throw it out. then find it again and throw it out. then find it a third time and crap our pantaloons. edit: thanks for my first gold! as soon as mom and i decide what to do with the ouiji board, i'll update the post again"	1325	41514	bt3zc7	eou1al0

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	k, so i live in this pretty suburban town in canada. however just about a kilometer behind us is a huge forest country that is completely backwoods and super creepy at night. anyway there was a party in this backwoods town one night so me and the boys decided to go. they left before i did and the guy i was supposed to leave with ended up crashing there. my mom didn't want me to stay the night so i called my sister and asked her to pick me up at the general store. so i left the house and it was about a 5km walk to the store. i got lost in the woods, and the shit i saw that night was absolutely terrifying. there was no noise in the world at all. not even my footsteps made noise. everything was dead silent. oh yeah and my phone was dead. but i'm not dumb, i knew the general store was east. so all i had to do was look for the north star. this is where i started freaking out. i looked up in the sky and there was no stars. nothing. this wasn't because of light pollution, it's a backwoods town at 2:00am. so i just kept walking, starting to freak the hell out. after walking through the woods for about an hour i came across a clearing but i stopped in my tracks when i saw a guy like 10ft in front of me. he was facing about 90 degrees away from me and there was something with his face and body that was just wrong. it was like he was incomprehensible to me. i got a huge chill down my spine and just a sense of dread like nothing i'd ever felt. keep in mind it was like 2:00am so there was no reason for this guy to be here. i didn't want to stick around for any longer so i turned right back and ran straight through the woods for as long as i could. eventually i reached a dirt road and collapsed, and by some stupid luck which i should not have been blessed with, i saw my sisters car pull up to me with a cop behind her. at this point it was like 4:00am and they were searching for me for like 3 hours. i got in the car and cried until i got home. i've never been back to that town, nor do i have any plans to go back. fuck. that.	396	41514	bt3zc7	eou8gbo
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	a few years ago i went camping with my dad, my sister, my dad's friend, and my dad's friends dog. to get where we camped we had to boat across and down a river to where some old woods is. this was proper camping, not a campsite or anything. when we were there me and my sis decided to play hide and seek, i ran into the woods to find her, and about 30 seconds in i see this medium sized man, about 50 with long, ungroomed, grey hair just standing their. i saw him for about half a second because i was running and did a turn and only caught a glimpse. as soon as it happened my heart raced and felt deep inside my body. i turned back to see him and he wasn't there. i knew i really saw him because he was in a yellow rain coat that stood out abruptly in the woods. i called out hello a few times because i knew my dad could hear me, and if i got in a situation him, his friend, and his dog would run over if i screamed help. but he was just gone. i yelled at my sister to come back and she did straight away. i told everyone but no one believed me that he was there. well about 3am that night a police helicopter had flown right down above our camp at the clearing on the edge of the woods, they had a huge bright white light pointing on the camp and my dad and his friend went out to look. i don't remember what quite happened as i was tired, so i just lay there on my sleeping bag, a bit worried. i remember the helicopter left like 5 minutes later. the next morning we packed up and left. bloated down the river to the cars, and on my dad's friends car was a small card, like the size of a business card, but it was a light purple with a flowery background. it had a poem about death on it, and said rip at the bottom. a small amount of days later my dad's friend saw in the paper, a guy had went missing right where we went camping by the river, and must of been thought to of drowned of something right when we were camping, still no one believes me i saw the guy next to our camp.	550	41514	bt3zc7	eoudhf6

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was three, we were picking up my grandparents for a sunday drive. i was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side. my grandfather was sitting in front of me. suddenly he keeled over, dead of a massive stroke. as they hustled my little sister and me out of the car and into my grandparents' store, i happened to look over my shoulder and plainly saw grandpa walking down the street with two men. both were dressed in suits, which made it all the more incongruous that grandpa was wearing the same gray sweater and peaked hat he'd been wearing a moment before in the car. there was nothing particularly creepy about the experience, except that i wouldn't accept that grandpa was dead because, after all, i'd just seen him walking down the street. naturally, this didn't go over very well. but i loved my grandpa, i didn't want him to be dead- and i knew what i had seen! when our family doctor arrived to pronounce grandpa dead, my mother asked me if i would take his word for it. we had a very good, trusting relationship with our doctor, so i said that i would. the doctor assured me that my grandfather had in fact died. but he was the only grown up who didn't treat me like i was crazy. he listened respectfully as i told him what i had seen, and he suggested that maybe the men in the suits were angels. this seemed reasonable. problem solved. but to this day i can still see grandpa walking down the street with those two men. and no matter what my parents tried to tell me, it wasn't just a guy who looked like grandpa coincidentally wearing exactly the same clothes he'd been wearing in the car. it was him.	5795	41514	bt3zc7	eotxw2i
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i once encountered what i can only think of to be a skinwalker. me and a friend were outside in a small town in germany, where my friend lived. it was past 11 pm on a summer evening, he would invite me for a sleepover on the 13th august every year, it always was pretty normal and we slept in a tent in his garden.this evening we decided to head to the towns playground to talk about stuff and do some stupid shit like doorbell-ditching. right behind the playground there was a small forrest in front of a big corn field. so after 20 minutes at the playground we hear a really loud scream, not anything human or anything that sounds like an animal, it came from the woods we turned around and saw something glowing brightly on the ground but it was a sphere and seemed almost liquid. we heard something running into the cornfield with fast big and light steps but suddenly the steps changed to a heavy slow trampling and something growled deeply. my friend and i tried to stay as quiet as posible not making a sound for the next 100 meters, then we ran off as fast as we could. i was paranoid the whole way back to his house and felt like someone was watching us. we instantly got in our tent when back at his home staying quiet and watching star-wars with headphones in one ear so that we could hear anything approaching (the ground was covered with leafs and you could hear everything that stepped onto it) our tent. we fell asleep at around 1 am. at 3 am i was woken to something walking in his backyard, i heard that it was bigger but very fast, i silently woke my friend up and we both listened to this creature walking around in his backyard. it suddenly stopped and we heard heavy thin breathing, like an old woman grasping for air. we were both extremely terrified. then again the creature started walking around but it's steps again turned heavy, like a bear or something, that's when all sounds seized for 15 seconds followed by light fast steps running away into the fields next to his house, and a high pitched screech. neither his nor my parents ever believed us. we visited the playground the next day to discover a few dead birds and a piece of wood still glimmering like a campfire that was left behind over the night, at the exact spot where the sphere was. edit: thank you guys for 125 upvotes!	196	41514	bt3zc7	eouabzt
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	ghost story time. i was living with a few of my friends a year and a half ago and were all pretty religious at least two of us work in religion. we were talking about how we didnt believe in ghosts or demons, at least in the sense that we couldnt see them if they were real. we started talking about how if we saw one it would change our perspective entirely. i said out loud, if something is here i wish it would just show us. two nights later im sound asleep and have the most vivid, brutal nightmare ive ever had. long story short i was in my childhood house, we were getting robbed, and the robber shot my father only it was me (i was the robber). my father and i had a very strained relationship and the detail of the shooting woke me up in tears. i mean i was sobbing. i looked at the foot of my bed and saw a man sitting on his heels staring at me. it looked like he was 80 years old but never hit puberty thats as best i can describe it. his face looked kind but his eyes looked so wicked it struck terror into my soul. he almost looked curious, but morbidly so. he was wearing clothes that looked like he was a newspaper salesman from 1890s new york. i only saw him for a split second and he was gone. the wild thing is i got all of that detail in just a split second, like he wanted me to remember him. heres the crazy part. so i was spooked to shit right? i went into our living room and watched youtube and some twitch streams for a bit until i convinced myself i was just half asleep and still spooked. i lay back in bed and the moment my head hits the pillow my room mate sits straight up in bed (still asleep), points at the foot of my bed and says, _______ (my name), who is that? i lost my god damn mind. i literally drove home at 3am and told my parents through tears i wanted to stay home until summer. i stayed at home for a week or so and then went back. my room mate started having night terrors after that but we moved soon after. ive never been so scared in all of my life. edit: ive had question about my room mates night terrors. the one i saw happened the first night i was back. basically were both sound asleep and he wakes up screaming. i dont mean yelling, i mean screaming. it sounded like an animal in pain, for those of you who have been hunting before he sounded like a dear screaming after being shot. i got down on the floor (he just slept on a mattress) and tried to calm him down but we locked eyes and he started to try to climb over me still screaming. he looked afraid, absolutely terrified. after two or three minutes he stopped all of the sudden, started mumbling and went back to sleep. i was holding his hands and our fingers were locked like when you wrestle and i had bruises the next day because of how hard he squeezed. the next morning i asked him if he remembers waking up screaming and he said, no but i had a crazy dream. you got down from your bed and started attacking me but you were covered in this black sludge. like your face was melting off but it was this tar-like goo that smelled like decay. after that two of my other room mates and i got together and prayed in our room. nothing quite as bad happened after that. some other less entertaining stuff happened like couches being stripped of their cushions and things spilling in the middle of the night. one time a bottle of wine just fucking exploded out of nowhere and scared us to death. thanks for the silver, was my first! edit #2: to be clear, im a seminary student and i work in ministry for high school students. not exactly a youth pastor, but sort of. i dont believe in spiritual healings or anything like that, im much more naturalistic about my beliefs but these things really happened, whether it was a hallucination or genuine spiritual thing i have no idea, i dont like to think about it.	6658	41514	bt3zc7	eou224p
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 8 or 9, me and my brother were laying in bed ready to go to sleep. then all of a sudden our room is illuminated with a bunch of flashing lights. it was probably around 10 pm at the time and we were scared shitless. so the lights go on for a good minute and afterwards, we immediately look out the window to see what it was and we see nothing. no car, no random person playing a prank on us, nothing. so we run to our mom and tell her what happened and she doesn't believe us and just tells us to go to bed and stop making stuff up. to this day me and my brother vividly remember this, bit no one ever believes us.	93	41514	bt3zc7	eou2szq
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"i was 8 and my brother was 10. it was sometime in the middle of the night when my brother went barging into my room saying, ""something is coming! something is coming!"". i went under my bed to hide and my brother went under the sheets on my bed. i laid there, and shit you not. door opens. and i see a pair of legs and feet that looked inhuman. idk how to describe it. it stood in front of my bed. then from there i dont remember what happened next. i went to sleep under my bed and my brother fell asleep on my bed. both me and my brother remember this still. (i'm 26 now and hes 28). unsure if it was our wild imagination or what. but for both of us to remember, makes me feel it may have happened."	411	41514	bt3zc7	eoudzeh
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"my aunt emotionally abusing me when i moved to her with 16, because my dad was abusing me. it went from bad to worse in a week. and no one believed me what i was experiencing. she had a light bulb installed in my basement room. it had a cable going all the way up to her. whenever she wanted me to come up, she would blink the light and i have to run upstairs immediately. i couldn't finish my last task, like finishing the sentence i was just writing or wearing a shirt because i was about to get dressed. if i wouldn't be there 10 sec after the blink signal i would have consequences reaching from losing internet/my laptop for a few hours/days, or being force fed or having mandatory ""family time"", because i would need to learn respect. family time was me sitting in the living room, not allowed to move or do anything than sit and stare (not even reading a book or writing my diary), while uncle and aunt would belittle me and say hurtful things to me. the signal was happening up to every half hour. i am still sensitive to lights. i didn't want to eat meat for ethical reasons. i didn't make a big thing out of it. i just told her she wouldn't have to buy extra meat for me and i would be okay with the veggies. that's when she started to add bacon pieces and eggs into the veggies. when i had a different opinion than her or her fat loser husband, she would bend my arms so i couldn't move, hold a mirror inches away from my face and let me repeat to myself ""i am a liar. i am wrong. [aunt] is right and i'm a liar."" until she would be satisfied. different opinions would mean stuff like once i came home from school, they wanted to know what i learned today. i was telling them about my philosophy class, and started my sentence with ""so first we assume that humans, as all animals."". ""did you just call us animals? you have no respect! thou shalt not lie!"". this particular argument dragged until the evening. my door to my bedroom was broken, because she kicked it in. i asked her if we could repair it. the answer was no, because otherwise she couldn't just enter because i surely would lock it. the door was always a crack wide open. i asked to get a magnet, so at least it would click close. after a few weeks i got one. i am very skinny and she is very fat and old. i don't like to show my body around, so i like to wear tights when i wear skirts and t-shirt that go all up to my neck, so nobody could see my bones. she would think, that i was making fun of her and feel better than her for having a ""perfect body"". she would force me to strip down in the hallway, where windows were to the street, because i was body shaming her by covering mine up. i wasn't allowed to wear tights. she would make fun of me for wearing my skirts low, so they would cover more of my boney legs. once i was wearing a blouse and was about to leave for school. the blouse was wrinkled so she wanted to iron it real quick. she told me to take it off, so i wanted to go to my room and switch to a shirt until the blouse was ironed. i wasn't allowed to do that. i had to strip to my bra in the hallway (where all neighbors could've seen me). i was holding my hands up to my chest and tried to stand in a doorway, so i couldn't be seen. when she noticed that, she forced my hands down and let me stand in front of our glass door. because i did that for shaming her body, she said, and i shouldn't be so ignorant. she force fed me. i was eating very little, but i never was anorexic or anything. she would cook extra much and let me having to eat more than i could, until i felt like puking. i gained 10kg in a year. that was the time when i tried to be bulemic, but jokes on me, i can't puke. no matter how much i press back there or force my finger or toothbrush down, it doesn't work. i gag a lot, but nothing comes up. believe me, i tried. so i started to drink a lot of alcohol, because i would always puke from that. i ended up in the hospital twice for alcohol poisoning during my time at hers. i started self harm. not cutting. not my arms, because she would see. i would scratch my legs with my fingernails and/or scissors, until i had raw and fleshy wounds. then i would touch those wounds as often as i could with dirty hands so they would get infected and crusty from pus. i wanted to have maximum pain throughout the day. in the summer, it was smelly. during my time there i lost track of all my hobbies. before i read several books per week. i played guitar and piano. i had a very solidly kept diary. i learned a bit of programming myself. i drew so much. i really wanted to go to art school. being called up several times a day interrupted everything i loved. bit by bit i gave up everything and started to just sit on my laptop mindlessly all day, because i was just waiting for the next time it would blink. i ran away two times and lived among some punks in some occupied spaces, because it was better than living in constant fear. i stood behind her with a knife in my hand too often to count. i once lifted it and was seconds away from stabbing her ugly fat back, when she turned around. i told her i want to see a therapist. she didn't allow me that because ""we are not sick"". we, as in the family. because only sick weirdos go to therapists. she didn't allow me to have hobbies. aty parents place i was a good dancer. i was in a dancing group for 4 years and my whole life evolved around it. it was the only place i had friends. my aunt forbid me, because i had to focus on family first. if i would behave, i could join a dancing group. going behind her back didn't work, because she would track my school bus and control that i would be home on time. my school friends often hung out after school. i wasn't allowed to. my school friends would always hang out at this bar every friday. i lived in a village, so i asked my aunt and uncle to drive me there. they did it. i always asked them to drop me off a bit further down the road (like every teenager i guess). after a few weeks my uncle grabbed me by my shoulders, face to face inches away and whispered that he knew i was a looser who didn't have friends. he knew, that i was just just a poor ugly girl drinking alone on that park bench where he drops me off whole night. i moved out when i was 18. all the time i was telling my parents and teachers about what i experience at home. but no one believed me, because my aunt told them i was just a raging teenager. nobody believed me. i know this isn't even the worst what people experience. there are people who had it way worse. i never believed i was abused until my therapist told me it was definitely legit to call it like that. this was the two year of my life, that ripped me of all my joy that was left over from my dad's abuse, and noone believed me. i am very sure this will get buried, but it felt good to write it out."	253	41514	bt3zc7	eougje6
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was a kid, i used to stay at my grandparents house a lot. theyve had that house for as long as my mom has been alive, possibly even longer. all i know is that the history of the property is still unknown to this day. anyways, i used to stay in my moms old childhood roomit was called the purple room due to the purple carpet and the lavender wallpaper. it was a pretty big room with a queen sized bed in the middle, and a humongous window right next to it. during the summer i would frequently stay at that house and spend a lot of time in that room. one night, i vividly remember waking up late at night, probably 1 or 2 in the morning, and seeing a puppet show outside my window. i wish i was making this up. they were hand/sock puppets and it looked like it was only performed by one or two people. it was only a shadow of this performance, which threw me off, so of course i assumed i was still a little tired and totally out of it and imagining the whole thing. i decided to brush it off my shoulder and ignore it. oh man, do i regret that. as soon as i turned over on my right side, there in the doorway was a large black figure. it was pitch black out in the hallway, but i could clearly see a figure standing there. my stomach sank and my heart started beating quickly. i was wide awake now. i blinked a few times and i swear every time i did, it got a little bit closer. when it got arms length away from me, thats when i felt my heart stop beating completely and my body turning cold. i swear i could see my breath because of how cold it is. i was able to muster up a scream that woke up both of my grandparents and brother from their deep slumber. my grandma was the first one to come into my room, but as soon as she flicked the lights on, it was gone. never to be seen again. i was sobbing and trying to tell her what i saw, but she just kept stroking my hair and saying i was just having a bad dream. i know that wasnt a dream and what i saw was real. i also believe that this thing that i saw as a child has followed me when i moved to a different state. i was about 6 or 7 when this happened and im 16 now. to this day, no one believes me edit: if youre assuming its a mental illness of some sort; such as schizophrenia or anything else, ive already gotten myself checked on multiple occasions and i am perfectly sane and healthy. :) thanks for all of the concerns though!	1490	41514	bt3zc7	eotxhfx
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"i work night shift at a nursing home. at my first job (5 years ago) the building used to be a school in the 50's. so the set up is already eerie. anyway. there was the usual noises heard in the distance and cold chills every now and then. the faucets in the rooms used to start running water randomly and the lights would turn themselves off and on. but the last straw was one night i felt someone tap me on the shoulder, and when i turned around i saw a silhouette pressed up against the privacy curtain and 2 skinny grey legs in blue slippers at the bottom of the curtain. when i moved the privacy curtain (thinking a resident had wandered into the room) no one was there, even though i could clearly see the outline of the body when i grabbed the curtain to move it. i called in and quit the next day. me calling don's private number: ""hey this is so-and-so. i dont think i'm coming in tonight. actually i'm not coming in tonight. i'm not coming back in any night. i quit. don: ""can. can i ask why?"" me: ""uh. no."" *hangs up. the facility i work in currently is down the street from that place. and one if my current coworkers used to work there. she has a similar story. side note: i also got stuck in the stairwell one time. you have to have codes to get in the doors so the patients can't just open the doors and fall down the stairwell. the keypad wasn't working. i had no phone and i was in tears by the time my nurses heard me banging on the door. surprised i'm still in this line of work."	501	41514	bt3zc7	eoubu3u
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"when i was about 14; there was two men that attempted a home invasion while i was home with my mom and a 2 year old she was babysitting. it's about 2 in the afternoon. while my mom was sleeping on the living room couch, she heard someone trying to open the front door. she jumped up and looked out the window to see a man at the front door and an unfamiliar car in the driveway. the man noticed my mom and immediately put his face next to hers in the window. ""i'm from the energy company, you called and i'm coming to check it out."" as hes talking tge other guy gets out the car and we can hear him walking to the back door. my mom tells the guy she didnt call anyone, shes not letting him in. these guys were in street clothes.fyi. the other guy is now trying to force himself in the back door. the guy at the front window jumps on the ledge of the window and starts banging his arms and legs against the window in an attempt to break it. he starts yelling and calling her and i names. my mom grabs the phone and calls the police. now mind you, we will in the inner city on a busy street. people are driving by.and they arent stopping, not are the guys bothered by it. this is a high crime area. it is scary to feel like everyone can see and no one is going to help. as my mom is on the phone with 911, (the guys continue to be loud and yell at us and call names.) a station wagon pulls up in our next door neighbors driveway and sits there for a moment. the door opens and a tall, white man in a suit gets out. he makes eye contact with the guy on the ledge of the window and the would be intruder just stops banging. the pounding at the back of the house suddenly stops (my mom at this time is just hanging up with 911.who claims to be on the way). the men hold eye contact (and the intruder remains standing on the ledge). the tall white man walks to our neighbors house and starts to knock and ring the doorbell. after about 20 seconds of strange silence the man jumps off the ledge and the other guy is now standing by the car. they continue to stare at that guy and silently get in the car and drive away. after they drive away, the man at the neighbor's house comes to our front window.tells in asking my mom if shes ok. she says she is, and he says ""they're gone now, and they wont come back, you guys can stop crying."" he then walks back to his car and drives away.silently. the police arrive (about an hour later.typical to come that long after.since no guns were involved. ) my mom and i tell them everything. they then talk to all the neighbors. they question our next door neighbors; who heard a lot of the yelling, but couldn't see much from the way their windows face our house. but.they have no recollection of anyone coming to their house during this time. no one came in the driveway, no one knocked on the door and no one rang the doorbell. so of course, the police continued to question about this part of the story that was made up. talk about the chills; all my hair stood up when the neighbors claimed no one came over. i can still see that station wagon driving away. it seems like time stopped; the guy even waved as he left. but.i cant remember what he looked like at all. i have a great memory for faces.but his is just a white spot.weird. remains one if the scariest things memories i have; and we still talk about that guy. where did he go????? saved our lives."	169	41514	bt3zc7	eouisv5

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"when i was about fifteen or so, i went upstairs in the early evening. the light was hitting the window at a low angle, and covered the wall over my bed with yellow light. &#x200b; the reflected light contained the shadow of words, and spelled ""execute jennifer"". i went to get my sister to show her, and the message was gone. &#x200b; she didn't know what to say, and didn't believe me. i told her that i didn't know anyone called jennifer and we agreed that that was probably for the best. &#x200b; we laughed it off, but i couldn't figure out how the words got there. the best guess i could make was that there's an bus shelter across the road with a large ad space behind reflective plexiglas, and that maybe words from that advert were reflected onto the wall. maybe my brain misread the words as something sinister. &#x200b; i've always had a logical outlook on the world, but i never figured out what that message was about or how it got there."	85	41514	bt3zc7	eoue3hc
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	it was afternoon in the middle of summer. i was delivering soda to an old mental hospital that was in the process of being shut down. my call sheet didnt say which of the several buildings i should go to so i was trying doors on all of them until i got one that opened. the building that did open was the crappiest looking so far; it was missing bricks, and looked somehow just darker than the others. like it suddenly wasnt such a sunny summer day anymore. i was ready to get suddenly shanked by modern day sarah connor as i walked down this empty hallway trying to find.anyone who worked there. finally found someone and got their liquid diabetes order into their break room. by this time id been there an hour and really had to pee. i asked the lady if i could use theirs and she pointed me down the hall. there was one of those sudden wall and floor style changes right before the bathroom like you get in old buildings where an addition is made way later. the bathroom is on the old side, darker and colder than the side where the break room was. i really have to go though, and as a woman in a male dominated industry id peed in more awkward circumstances, so i walked in. its a one toilet deal and i locked the door behind me after finding the light switch, because there was no window. i sat and started the stream before realizing that it was a combo toilet shower room, with the shower recessed into the wall right in front of where i was sitting. all dirty institutional tile with an old, old school set of fucking chains and manacles for uncooperative patients bolted into the wall. it was the creepiest thing id ever seen. and as i peed and stared those fucking chains started swaying back and forth on the goddamn wall. yall, do your kegels because i cut off that stream while i was standing and pulling my pants up so fast i broke the sound barrier. the chains were still clanging around while i was struggling with the rusty old deadbolt on the door of that godforsaken, haunted-ass ancient lunatics bathroom. i ran down that hallway out to the truck fit to start crying, and i was not any kind of stranger to weird haunted things like that. it somehow scared me worse than growing up in a ghost-ridden house ever did. mental hospitals being decommissioned, never again.	2066	41514	bt3zc7	eou293t
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"\*\*\*edit\*\*\* thanks everyone for reading my experience. as i figured, a lot of people wouldn't believe it (thus the theme of the thread.) little follow up to what all i can remember is that my dad instantly switched from working nights to working days so he could be home at night if anything else happened. a few months later my parents finally saved up enough money to move into a much better neighborhood. ever since i moved out of that area i never had any problems, other than the night terrors, since then.i will post a picture of the house below. mind you the surround houses drastically changed in appearance over the past like 20 odd years, but the old house still remotely looks the same. (its the puke green colored house) [https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8](https://imgur.com/a/eodtxq8) only my mom ever believed me about this, unfortunately she is no longer alive so i cannot ask her for anymore details than what i have been told while growing up. my dad just never wants to talk about what happened. i used to live in this rented house near an appliance store from birth up until i was six years old. i am 24 now and out of the military, if that tells you how long ago this was. since it was a small house and i was the younger sibling, and my dad worked nights, i ended up sleeping in my parents room until we moved out. it should be noted that one side of my bed was against a wall, and the other facing the doorway. i remember having this cookie monster plush that i was obsessed with and would never go to sleep without it. if my mom ever tucked me in without it i would throw a tantrum until i had my best friend. things started to change when i was about to turn four though. my mom would wake up and notice i would be sleeping without the plush and that it would be under my bed. not thinking much of it, she would just put it back in my bed and let me continue sleeping. this kept going on for a couple of weeks until my mom finally decided to ask me about why cookie monster would always be under my bed when she would wake up. i remember saying something along the lines of ""he is my friend, he talks to me and likes to walk around at night."" or something of that matter. from my perspective, i knew i was talking to cookie monster because i could see his eyes. you know how he has those big white eyes that stick out. he would talk to me at night and help me go back to sleep when i was scared. my mom played it off as my overactive child's imagination, but it slowly was about to get worse.over the course of the next couple of months i would have night terrors. no, not simple nightmares. i am talking about full blown night terrors, so bad to the point i would stiffen up and do nothing but scream as my mom tried to rock me back to sleep. this went on for almost every single night.they were so scarring on younger me that to this day i remember what they were about. i would be laying in bed at night when my cookie monster plush would came to life, drag me out of my bed, and pull me under it to eat me. shit, i never stopped getting these dreams until i was 14 that is how scarring they were. about a year from moving out of the house and into a better place, my mom would learn the truth behind the whole ordeal. she woke up to some noises one night and heard me out in the living room talking to cookie monster. now you might expecting that i am going to say she saw me talking to the plush, but you are wrong. you might expect me to say that i was laying in my bed and only the plush was out in the other room, but you are wrong. but reality is much, much scarier than any fictional story. what she saw instead, is much worse than any paranormal activity shit you could ever see in any move theater, for instead of a possessed doll, she saw me standing there, talking to the dark.my mom instinctively turned on the light and as soon as she did, two old guys went running out of the now wide open front door.the only thing i remember from that night was my mom holding onto me for dear life as my dad and the police rushed to the house.the thing that scares me to this day is not the fact that i was talking to two random strangers that night. what scares me to this day, is that i was talking to these people for months without knowing it. i was talking to the people who were constantly breaking into my house every night. that they were breaking in for months without kidnapping me, or stealing anything from us. what scares me to this day is that i still have no idea what they ever planned to do."	5293	41514	bt3zc7	eou3jxh

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	not sure if it counts but quite creepy, since it's not that people don't believe me, but the second part isn't quite creepy to them as it actually is. here it goes: there's this abandoned resort place like a 15 minute walk away from my house. the place is old, cieling fell in some places. one day, me and a friend were exploring and found some papers, one of them was a list of people that died while building the place, sizeable list, maybe 10-15 people. a few weeks ago, me and that same friend were there at night for some night pics. when we approached the place, it was nothing unusual. but later a bit we heard stuff fall and break inside, (keep in mind, if anything was there, it would have escaped a while ago. since we were blasting some music to negate the creepiness there. also there are no wild animals around the place, like never, and it is in a rural area, and it's not possible to even meet a homeless person around these parts, let alone one sleeping there) as we're taking this long exposure milky way pic with the resort in frame, we heard some glass break, even though there is just about no glass left to break here. we felt some extremley strong creepy feeling and legged it outta there as soon as we took the pic. i'll link the pic shortly. edit: here it is: https://i.redd.it/nwemklqe54q21.jpg edit2: forgot to say i had some very wierd time sleeping that night	1718	41514	bt3zc7	eou7fkr
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	maybe less creepy and more of just flat out weird, but one christmas morning many years ago my friend and i decided to meet up at a park just to hang out. now this park has a clear view of a very major highway and unsurprisingly it was empty. maybe one or two cars every 7 minutes or so. however, at one point cars just stopped coming entirely for like a 30 minute period and out of the blue a horse drawn carriage makes its way down the highway. my friend and i kind of look at each other to confirm that we were both seeing it, and yes it was real. mind you this is socal so this isn't a common occurrence at all, but we brushed it off as maybe a quince celebration or something, so we get up and start walking back to my house. suddenly we look up and a parachuter is dropping down a decent distance away. no plane in sight, and no logical landing location. we both stare at him for a while before continuing to walk, a few seconds later we both look back to see how our man up there is doing and he's gone. we confirm with each other that yes we both saw him and yes he seemed to have disappeared. as we walk, puzzled, a car drives by. no problem there, we were in a neighborhood at that point. however, he turns a corner and just pure silence. we were maybe 10 feet from that corner so logically we should have at least heard it go into the distance, but we didn't. it turned the corner and just was gone. we ran to see it, and there was no trace. i'm pretty sure we were in some sort of alternate reality there.	75	41514	bt3zc7	eou9uuu
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i used to do this as a kid, but id hallucinate stuff like shadows arguing or corner of my eye people. i know the things i see arent real and cant hurt me, but it still doesnt change the fact that im terrified shitless of them. the scariest one was reoccurring. its more recent and im chalking up its creation to me being stressed out. it would perch on my table and watch me from across my bedroom. its always dark but i know that if i can see it, it can see me. when id say something about it, everyone would laugh and say that i was nuts/i was cursed. i havent seen it in a few months and idk if itll come back. edit: today i learned, i might have a brain tumor or (more popularly) schizophrenia. guys, i really appreciate your advice. i just dont want to have an evaluation only to get a whole bunch of mental illnesses stamped on my forehead. edit #2: im aware of the things that might be wrong with me. thank you for your insight and most of you have been helpful. i am looking into what i should do in terms of getting this whole thing figured out.	836	41514	bt3zc7	eotxjl1
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i remember when i was little and was taking a bath with the help with my mom. some guests came over so she left me alone for a bit to talk to them leaving me. personally i was always scared of being alone in the bathroom - maybe because of bloody mary or being a pussy. anyways, i remember looking at the mirror and swear to god seeing a women in their with black hair, white skin, staring at me. its very cliche, black hair, pale skin, looking at me in the mirror. it could be my imagination but this isnt the first time ive seen crazy shit update : just had a fucking nightmare	325	41514	bt3zc7	eotyzlp
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i went to a non-religious highschool in the uk. i was always a nerdy kid who the teachers liked so often got given tasks like delivering papers to other teachers or to bring sick kids to the nurse. basically little jobs which meant i was walking around the school occasionally outside of class times. for about a month or so i kept seeing this nun walking around the school when nobody else was around. i'd get back to class and tell my mates but they all thought i was taking the piss. i asked a few of the teachers and they just openly laughed at me saying we don't have nuns at the school. it became a massive running joke with a lot of people in my class that i kept seeing nuns that weren't there. i even saw the bloody nun when i was with my friends once and pointed her out and the walked around the corner. my friend just missed her and we couldn't find her after running after the nun. one girl later said she also saw the nun but still people didn't believe me. over 10 years on i'm still bitter. fuck that nun	72	41514	bt3zc7	eouo17n
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"so, my best friend believes me, but no one else. my boyfriend was staying the night with us (theres me and 3 other roommates, one being my best friend). he and i went to bed around 3 am because he had to leave early, and i had work at 4 pm. i tried to sleep, even took melatonin. every time i would almost get to sleep, my body would tense and i'd gasp and panic. i kept having minor panic attacks. i wasn't stressed or anything. i took antistress gummies just in case. it worked a little bit but i still kept tensing and gasping. finally, i felt myself drift asleep. my eyes were partially open and i could see this girl. it didn't freak me out. i do believe in the paranormal but i'm also skeptical. i debunk stuff like that all the time. she was about 8ish years old, african american with short pigtail braids. her mouth didn't move but i could hear her talk, ""this is how i sleep."" she was holding a small blanket or something, ""i put the blanket this way on my legs and i move so my body is like this"" she shifted like she was laying down but she was still vertical. my body automatically moved the way she did. i didn't realize it until right before i fell asleep. i passed out and didn't wake up once. i told my boyfriend and he swears i was dreaming but i remember what my tv was playing and the way he was sleeping. i wasn't dreaming. sorry for how long that was lol"	145	41514	bt3zc7	eouedgq
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	finally- my chance to shine! so, i live in edinburgh in scotland which has, naturally, rather a lot of old buildings. when i was four my family moved into a victorian villa that was built in 1860. lovely place, beautiful big garden - happy days! that was, until what i like to refer to as the incident of the window. so, one afternoon small me was sat under the window in the ground floor living room playing with some barbis. mum is in another room, and no one else is in. no-one else should be outside either, may i point out! but lo and behold, i look up to notice someone walking along the front of the house toward the window i am sat under. panic ensues at this point, but its hard to describe. while i was definitely a shy child, i wasnt terrified of general people in the public sphere. all i can remember is this really strong feeling of wrongness, so i dipped behind the armchair that faced away from the direction the gentleman was walking and hid. after a bit i peek around the side of the chair to see if its safe to come out yet, and see a man passing the window. he lifts his hat at me and smiles, then continues on his way. i howl for my mum! after a mad dash through to the sitting room, and my garbled explanation of the problem, she goes outside to obviously find nobody there. she checks our wash house, the summer house and the garage but they are all free of middle aged men in jaunty hats. she assumes someone has come down the drive, which is long and cuts around the side of the building with a separate entrance, assuming it was a short cut off the street and left when they realised their mistake. adult me finds this story pretty implausible but heyho, we say what we need to to placate kids eh?! and in the past a couple of people had made that mistake, only they realised and turned back / apologised long before reaching the far windows! anyway, i am assured its nothing to worry about and go back to days whiling away the merry childhood hours doing random crap in this room by that window. however!! later in that same week the *same man* appears again! (how bad aaare his directions, you might well ask). this time mum and i are alone again, but with the important difference she is doing the dishes in the kitchen next door and is stood in front of the window: looking out. she has seen nobody go past, but at my shout of that funny looking man is back! she bolts out the door in a flash - to find absolutely no-one there. a fact she already expects because she has seen nobody go past the entire time she has been in the kitchen. again, she checks all the out buildings - and finds nothing. once again she attempts to reassure me that it is probably nothing to worry about; that it probably wasnt the same man and that they will put something on the drive to make clear it isnt a passage for the public. i insist doggedly to anyone who will listen that this was the same man, and that he looked funny. eventually my grandma, who is a big believer in the supernatural, came to stay with us and the whole incident is brought up. by this point i no longer willingly go anywhere near windows on that side of the house and live in general terror of people looking in at me. she asks me to describe who i saw. at this point i feel i should mention how utterly obsessed with the victorian period i was for my entire childhood. i was forever playing olden days set then, i had loads of dressing up clothes of it, and collected lots of childrens tv or books set in, or about, the period. you can probably see where this is going, but i described a victorian mans get up, which my grandma recognised instantly. she said she thought it was the old gardener by the style of dress i explained, down to the hat, and that she thought it was just his way of letting us know he was happy a new family had come to live there. her and my mum thought that was a lovely heart warming tale, but i have spent the rest of my life terrified of it - meanwhile anyone else who ever heard the story either believes the same man stupidly walked down that drive by mistake twice in one week, or that i fell asleep and dreamt it. twice in one week tho? ** edit: just clarifying, i realise people do have recurring dreams. its the notion of me falling asleep, while sat on the floor next to a table playing with toys, twice at a random time of day in a week that i would say is unlikely to me! also, not saying it was def a ghost. it was just really weird / unsettling!	595	41514	bt3zc7	eoucyvv

"for about a year i would get these phone calls, always at the same time (2 or 3 am), and the caller never spoke. just. breathing. then the time changed and the calls were coming at about 11 am. then the calls stopped for about a year. they started coming in again. again, regularly around the same time of day 2 or 3 times a week. i started having fun with it. i would answer and say ""hey buddy haven't heard from you in a while! i've really missed our little chats."" then i started collecting cat facts to recite to them. or i would discuss current events. i think the longest i was able to keep them on the line was about a minute and a half. ended up getting a new phone number but i wonder about my harmless stalker sometimes. hope you're doing well, weirdo. not super creepy but that's all i got."	191	41514	bt3zc7	eoupymr

"it's not really what i've seen, but what i felt and heard. when i was around either 8th or 9th grade, i had a bunk bed in the living room this time with my brother. in the room currently was my little brother watching youtube. he was either a 1st grader or a kindergartener at the time. but, after i climbed up onto my top bunk and was trying to sleep, i felt something. i felt something rub up my legs and thighs. i ignored it, thinking it was just my body being weird. but, then i heard something that sounded like a full grown man whisper in my ear, ""i know you feel me."" it scared the shit out of me, i shot up out of my bed and looked around for my dad but can only find my brother sitting away from me, and watching youtube still. i used to still get that feeling of someone touching me here and there, but now that i'm older i don't. i called the guy mg, ""molester ghost."" i think i just got too old for his preference."	65	41514	bt3zc7	eouo6bq
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"before starting this story, keep in mind that i was around 9 years old, so certain details are lost to me. but the story is still the same. &#x200b; &#x200b; around 2010, i lived in a two story apartment. and was in the 4th grade at the time. living with my older brother and my two parents. due to my brother being the oldest child in house, he had his own space. he just djayed all day and all night long, mixing music and having a good time. making ""fire"", basically. he also had a medium sized disco-ball that filled his room with colorful lights when it was night, and turned it on each time he was still djaying late into the night. one day, i was walking in the hallway upstairs when he called my name, wanting to show me something. which turned out to be a video he recorded on his phone. he proceeded to tell me that he left it on his bed and forgot about it. because of this, it lead to his phone recording for 10 minutes and some number of seconds. he then told me that there was something weird about the video, and that he wanted me to see it. i said okay, and he played it. for the first two minutes, you just heard mexican music and dub-step in the background. as he was trying to composite those two music genres together. and his room was completely dark minus for the disco ball i mentioned rotating random colors everywhere, making seeing his room difficult. another two minutes in and stuff started to get strange. you see, in the video, the music got quieter. and at some point, it stopped. so it was just quietness for a couple moments. i remembered being a little unnerved by this. then late into the video, he asked if i saw it. i said *saw what*. he then backed tracked, and pointed to a mask he had sitting on top of his tower computer. something that i completely overlooked when watching his video. then he said to watch it. i saw this mask-head thing go up and down very, very slowly. he even scrolled back and forth in the progress bar and made sure that i saw it. since i was a kid and all. i was really freaked out by it. i then proceeded to ask if his fucking with me, he said no and that he's not shitting. i believed his answer because he didn't crack a smile and didn't show any signs that he was lying, but i did know that he is a bit of a liar sometimes. the weird thing that i think about now recalling this memory is that i never actually this mask in his room when i walked into his room and showed me this video. i know that this could've been easily faked, but it still unnerved me by how weird it was. and how serious his face was. only me and him knew this happened, my parents don't know. but i don't think it matters &#x200b; anyway, that's all."	330	41514	bt3zc7	eou4n5j

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was a wee child, when i was still put down for naps, every day a shadow man would pop out from the end of the bed as soon as my mom left the room. it would pop up and do a little hop before just standing there, as if it was waiting for me. it had no face, or any other discernible features other than the general body structure of a man, with it's entire being simply a flat, opaque brown-grey shadow. despite this, it would stare at me. each and every day, for the duration of my nap. when it started i would call frantically for my mom, but she would never come to save me. as time went on, however, i grew used to the shadows presence, though never comfortable with it. i never did fall asleep with it there. it never harmed me, or even acknowledged me beyond the staring. it would, however, occasionally wave, as if saying goodbye to something on the other side of the bed. occasionally there would be 2. sometimes both on the same side, and sometimes on opposite sides. they were practically the same, *different* at the same time. they never acknowledged each other, just *me*, though when they were on opposite sides they would stare at each other in addition to me. as i grew out of naps i stopped seeing him/them. i still live in the same house though and i know they are still there. as i've posted this story in the past redditors have suggested everything from faes to sleep paralysis. all i know is i saw something and it's fucking terrifying.	551	41514	bt3zc7	eotwp02
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	back in 1999 when i was twelve, i saw an explosive light in the night sky. i was in a grocery store parking lot, and i didn't even think to look up until i noticed other people pausing in the lot and gazing upward. it looked like a flower of fire, spreading out slowly and burning bright. from our view, it was twice the size of the moon at its maximum spread. it then began to fade, but it was an eerie kind of fade-out that didn't register until it was completely gone. it could have been any sort of natural space phenomena, a rare spectacle of our galaxy bent on relativity and such with nothing to do with ufos or ball lighting or whatever. every time i tell people, though, they just smirk and shake their heads at me, even though there are crazier stories out there with less/no witnesses.	125	41514	bt3zc7	eou186o

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	so yeah, got a couple. over the course of maybe two weeks in a new house my family got a lot of paranormal activity. first was my older brother who saw a middle aged man fron the 60s looking outside the window , just floating in the living room, no legs. my mother often heard a very young girl run all the way across the corridor at night, and converse with my very young brother (also, when she appeared, the trap used for going into the attic (which is realllllly heavy) was completely opened). i saw a shadowy figure climb the stairs with me one day, but it wasn't mine since i eventually stopped, but the shadow climbed two more stair before turning his shoulders towards me as if he was saying : the hell you waiting for? i also heard a big scary mean voice kinda scream something completely intelligible in my ears, and thats it. felt in danger for like 6 hours straight, wasn't fun. we eventually found out that the first man in the living room was the deceased cousin of my grandma (motorcycle accident) thanks to a photo of him that my brother recognised immediatly. everything stopped after 2-3 weeks strangely enough.	175	41514	bt3zc7	eou2gw7

"ah, well. first off sorry for formatting, mobile user. there's this old house where some family members worked, it's called 'east riddlesden hall.' it's been there for yonks and it's known to have weird/paranormal phenomena go on inside, these are a couple of stories from my family that worked there. story one: my great uncle was going around the house looking for anyone still inside before it shut (it's a museum so people are allowed inside, providing no touchy) and all other staff except the receptionist had gone home and he'd noticed a particularly strong smell of toffee/caramel cooking. this smell had originate from the kitchen, with nobody inside , it's out of use anyway so he goes and asks the receptionist about it and she stands up and follows him to the kitchen, she says she can smell bacon cooking. they make sure nobody's left a weird smelling air freshener or something and locked up, assuredly a little bit creeped out. story deux: my sister had been working there a couple of weeks and was using one of those light detector machines (like the ones they use on ghostbusters, but for light levels, i can't remember the exact name of it) and closing the blinds to make sure nothing gets damaged from light exposure, when one of her colleagues walks in and they start chatting. they were facing each other so my sister could a see a door behind her partner and while they were talking, saw a flash of light followed by a woman in a dress walk past. she asked around and was eventually told that that figure was the lady of the house who was killed by her husband for reasons that aren't important, it was in her room which is known as ""the grey lady's chamber"" for fairly obvious reasons. if any of you are skeptical, please. go and look this up, it's really interesting."	61	41514	bt3zc7	eoub59a
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"about 15 years ago, my wife and i separated when my two youngest were 2 and 4 years old. she went to live with her mom, leaving the children with me. the two youngest shared a room. they had a hard time with their mom leaving and i had to deal with some behavioral issues and night-time complaints. also, both their mom and nana would show up at random times to ""spend time"" but really just to chew me out about some thing or another. one morning, about 4 or 5 am, they both came crying into my room saying that nana visited them and talked to them. once i got them calmed down and asleep, in my bed, i called their mom. i was livid. showing up at random times during the day was one thing, showing up at 4 am was beyond the pale. she answered in tears and said, ""i can't talk right now, mom died in her sleep last night."" and hung up. i have no idea how long i sat there, until i went back to bed and cuddled with my two youngest children. they have since grown up, time being what it is, and have forgotten all about it. one has decided they are an atheist and doesn't believe in supernatural anything, to the point where they won't even watch shows where supernatural events are portrayed. the other has become a nihilist who believes supernatural things may be possible, but ghosts don't exist because when we die we just . evaporate. no one else was there. no one, not even the two most involved, believes that this happened."	66	41514	bt3zc7	eoukzuf
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i'm probably really late but this is the perfect chance to share my story. let me preface it by saying my dog is nine years old now. in those nine years she was only ever aggresive one single time. that was when she was four years old. about five years ago, it was around 8 pm and my friend is over and we are making food and getting ready to watch a movie. all the blinds are open to the back porch and the light is on shinning in the backyard. my dog is sleeping by the front door which is on the entire other side of the house. we sit down with our food and turn on the show, not even two minutes in and both of us out of the corner of our eyes see a very tall almost human like creature scurry/run across the back yard. both of us felt completely paralyzed and couldn't move. the light in the back then goes out, and in that brief moment my dog comes running at light speed to the back porch door snarling with all her teeth out. that entire night she refused to move from the back porch door and just sat there showing her teeth. my friend and i have never experienced anything like it and to this day we both get chills talking about it. the light from the back porch never worked again after that night. ive tried googling what it was we saw and neither of us ever came up with a good explanation, but there is no way it was human.	62	41514	bt3zc7	eoupwa0
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i've posted this elsewhere. back in the 70's (yes i'm old) i was hitchhiking. one ride dropped me off but i still had about 20 miles to home. it was one of those dark roads, no lights or houses, just corn fields on either side. i began to walk but there wasn't any traffic. i can hear the echo of my footsteps, i thought. i stopped and heard something walking inside the corn. then it stopped. i began to walk. it walked. i ran. it ran. i quickly did a 180. i heard it stop, turn and begin to run, then suddenly stopped. as soon as it got beside me it stopped. i ran again and did a 180. it ran, then did the 180. i could see the top of the corn moving. i saw headlights coming and stepped into the middle of the road and was waving my arms and they stopped. i jumped in. that haunts me to this day. i could tell it was a bi-ped. i did live in an area that had bigfoot sightings, and an insane asylum. so my mind was racing. i've never been that scared again.	63	41514	bt3zc7	eourfkm

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	"i'm posting from my mum's perspective as i never personally saw what she saw, but i was the only one who believed her. a couple of years ago my mum ran a hugely successful cleaning business in england, and based on her location most of her clients were based in the countryside in huge houses ( biggest house she had to clean was a mansion with over 100 rooms to give you an idea of the scale of these houses) anyway, one of the houses she cleaned was a huge bed and breakfast that was converted into a huge house. this house is estimated to have been built sometime in the 1700's ( not that uncommon in the english countryside) the family there consisted of a husband, wife and 3 kids between the ages of 3-5. a very important detail is that one of their kids died at teenager age, maybe 14 based on pictures (mum never asked how, she felt too disrespectful to ask) the husband was a bit strange, anti social, career focused. he was mostly at work so mum and i didn't see him often. the wife was maybe mid 20's, very chatty and friendly and she loved her kids. the fact they were such a normal family makes the events of this story worse. so, mum was asked to clean the 3 floors of the house. however, the wife told mum that on the 3rd floor is where the guest rooms are and they collect a lot of cobwebs. (old house, completely normal) and so they only need cleaning once a month. this is where things get weird. she was given strict instructions not to enter the room 3rd along the hallway on the 3rd floor. that was their dead sons room and they want it left completely alone. okay, sure. the first time she did the new cleaning job at this house, she came home early in absolute hysterics. now, this is a woman who was a carer for years, she's held many dead bodies and guts in her time. so not a lot affects this woman, she's a tough mum. i've never seen anything affect her like this day she came home. she said as soon as she climbed those stairs to the 3rd floor, everything went quiet and freezing cold. chalking it up to old creepy house, she pressed on. she opened up the door to the hallway that leads to the 6 guest rooms. upon walking in, the 3rd and 4th door opens inwards and she hears a young child giggling, and a child on a tricycle comes out the 3rd door and wheels round to the 4th. my mum dropped the hoover and ran the fuck out of there. she asked her other employee to come up with her. they didn't see the boy again, but the atmosphere was still there. they peeked into the 3rd room (my mum has huge balls and morbid curiosity that overrides her fear) and she said it looked like a murder scene. there was dried brown blood on what looked like a normal kids room, on the covers of the bed, the carpet etc but she said the worse part was turning to the wall and seeing ""help me"" scrawn into the wall in fresher blood than the rest. mum and employee got the fuck out of there. they immediately went downstairs to the wife, and just as she was about to say "" i'm not cleaning the 3rd floor at all, you need to find someone else."" the wife looked to her and said "" i can tell you went up to the 3rd floor, i understand you don't want to clean up there, none of the cleaning companies we've hired will go up there. we usually do it ourself. "" upon hearing this story from mum i was thinking hoooly shit. i dont understand how this family uses those rooms as guest rooms! as in, friends and family stay in those rooms over christmas etc. a few months later, she was scheduled to do that house alone, she practically begged me to come along. now it's not uncommon i helped out at the time because i loved her and supported her business but in all honesty i was shit scared. she even had to offer me payment before i considered. so upon arriving i immediately hate this house. huge long driveway, massive courtyard in front of the house. old rotting wood supports, all windows facing outwards towards the courtyard where we park the van. i can see those 3rd floor windows and i am extremely nauseous. the 3rd floor windows are completely black, but my mum was certain they didn't have curtains. oookay. so, i start cleaning, and the first thing i noticed is that there are hidden cameras everywhere. i mean, fucking everywhere. maybe mum didn't spot them because she doesnt know what's she's looking for ( she's a bit old bless her) but i could see little glowing lights where they were on and recording, they were very well hidden mind you, i can't be certain i found all of them but in the whole house i counted 130 cameras. 130. one hundred, and fucking thirty cameras have been recording mum and all her employees ( including me) for months. what the fuck. upon this discovery, i immediately told mum and she went apeshit at the wife, who was the only person present. mum hated being filmed while doing her job, and it's not uncommon people record cleaners to make sure they don't steal, but not 130 fucking cameras. this is where the story gets worse than that creepy upstairs. the wife had no fucking clue what we were on about. what the fuck. we went around the house and i pointed them all out for mum and the wife. the wife was gobsmacked at this. we had to leave for the day as we had finished, and the wife said she'd have words with her husband when he got home. so. the next week i come with mum again and as soon as we greet the wife we know something is very wrong today. the wife is teary eyed and has a weak voice. she asks us to sit down in the kitchen for a talk. she says she confronted the husband and found out a lot of things. firstly, all these cameras went to a random, locked room where the husband had a mini cctv setup where he held all the footage, and he was forced to show the wife what recordings were stored. ooh boy. there were thousands of trimmed videos of my mum cleaning, bending over, working and were extremely perverted, not only that, but he saved recordings of his own kids undressed in their rooms. oh my god i felt so sick hearing this. she said she was going to the police when he goes away on a trip to avoid more confrontation because she was scared, she was also packing up her and the kids stuff to move to her mums house. she begged my mum not to ever come near the house again and she will pay her to keep this quiet. ( i guess they had a reputation in the area and didnt want word going around? not sure how you can keep that shit safe??) to this day, mum and i have never said a word about what that wife said to us. she said she wont accept any money for bribery, and she will never be in contact again, and that was that. we went in the van, went home and had lunch. we both didn't want to speak and felt so sick. we still haven't spoken about it in full. bonus, we drove past that hellhole house about 2 years afterwards and we saw a new family playing in the gardens outside the front. myself, mum and that employee are the only people who know what we saw. mum tried telling the story of the room to the rest of the employees and they laughed as if it was a ghost story. she never mentioned that weird fucking husband. sadly, these things are much more scary when it's for real. fuck. tl;dr creepy house with a young family, their child died and they kept his room as it was which was covered in blood, saw the boy riding a tricycle upstairs. even worse, the husband had cameras planted around the house and had recordings of my mum cleaning and his own children undressing. we got the fuck out of there and never saw them again, new family moved in and house is back to normal.

[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	in december i was back visiting my host family in the us. my host brother and i went to an outlet center, to pick out some new clothes. i was just minding my own business, when out of the blue, a black labrador came running at me. while petting him, i couldnt stop noticing, that it looked a lot like my old labrador back home. he even had the same white spot under the belly. eventually it ran back around the corner, and we continued shopping without thinking about it. fast forward a couple of hours, i get a call from my real mom back home. she was crying, and she told me theyve put down my labrador(he was very sick), a couple of hours before. i still believe he came back, to say his goodbyes.	54	41514	bt3zc7	eourazi

"when i was about 3 i kicked my ball into my neighbors house. nobody was living there at the time and the front door was open, i kicked the ball further into the house for no reason and it went into a room. i remember hearing a voice and then seeing the voice coming from what looked like a gas cloud in the room staying still. no idea what i saw but my brothers remember me trying to show them the ""gasman"""	56	41514	bt3zc7	eou7h5m
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was four i fell asleep on the couch next to my mom. i woke up later in the night and the television was static and silent and lit up the dark room. i saw a woman walk out of the basement and into the kitchen. she turned to me with her finger to her lips to tell me to be quiet. she slowly walked to the other side of the room, motioning me to follow her. when she turned the corner where i could not see her, i woke up mom who told me i had a bad dream. this has always stuck with me and it happened in the 70s.	56	41514	bt3zc7	eou7lwv
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 12, i was in a living room with a bunch of family members. people talking, music playing, even the front door was open so you could feel the air flow and hear the noises outside. all of a sudden everything went still and quiet, like time itself froze for everything but me. it took a second or two before i clued in that something was wrong, and i could see people around me looking exactly as they did, even with my grandpa in the middle of a story with his mouth wide open. i walked a few steps forward to try and figure out what was happening and really to just see if i even could move, and then like a switch it all started back up again. absolutely no one believed me and i don't blame them. to this day i've only told maybe three or four people in real life and i've lived a long time since then.	49	41514	bt3zc7	eoun8yz
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this is going to get lost, but here it goes. i was probably about 7 or 8 years old. my room was at the end of the hallway with the stairs to the attic right outside my door. the way my bed was positioned, i could see the bottom of the stairs and clear down the hallway. well one night i flip over, and i see the legs of a woman sitting on the stairs. she wore a long dress and dress shoes. i covered my head with the blankets until i ended up falling asleep. a few years later, i'm playing spiderman 2 in the guest room on my gamecube. i saw the shadow of a woman in a dress and a veil walking along the wall. just as it disappeared, some toys from the toy box fell over. there was nothing that should have made a shadow like that. there was only one window, but it had a garbage bag over it because my dad slept there when he worked overnight (the bag blocked out the light). after i graduated high school, i moved out to indiana (this all occured in pennsylvania). i met my wife there and we have a daughter. well last thanksgiving, we came to visit my parents for the holiday. we slept in the guest room, and after the first night, my wife said she got a bit creeped out last night. when i asked why, she told me she woke up and thought she saw a black figure standing over me, but it disappeared after a few seconds. remembering my childhood, i asked her what it looked like. she described exactly what i had seen as a child. a woman in an old long dress and a veil. i had never told my wife about the woman i saw growing up because i brushed it off as the imagination of a child. now i'm not so sure.	52	41514	bt3zc7	eoupusg
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	this happened to me when i was about 14 years old. i and my friend were really into photography at the time and we woke up early to shoot empty streets in the morning sun. we were walking on a small street filled with family houses, nobody was around except us and that blue-soft morning light was giving a pretty dreamy look to everything. (i can't give a more accurate description in english sry) anyway. we came around one corner and we could clearly see one of the houses on fire. whole house burning down at once. we have both seen it. we both felt the heat, heard the terrifying sound of a giant fire. we panicked and called the firefighters. gave them coordinations of the house and everything. but as i said, we were 14 and really scared so we both gave up on waiting for the firefighters thinking that staying near the house would just bring us trouble and we ran away in panic. next day we came back to see how did the fire damaged the house and guess fucking what. everything was normal. no sights of fire or damage. we were discussing what could possibly cause that for like 15+ minutes until we have decided to knock on the door. middle-aged women opened them and got pretty pissed when we told her about the fire. she thought we were just teens trying to be funny. later we got into huge trouble for bothering the fire brigade. to this day we are both sure we saw that exact house on fire. but officially that house never burned or any different house in that area.	335	41514	bt3zc7	eoubyf4
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	it's neither my scariest nor creepiest i've seen and since i've two friends who saw the same thing, i certainly have someone who believes me but it still is my most prominent thing i remembered in my first year at the middle school till these days. it maybe past five and school's over so does my playing around behind the home economies building. with my two friend who heading home in the same direction as mine, we simply walk across the all-purpose field, which have a huge flag pole in the middle, to the school gate. while doing that, i don't know why, maybe because of the flag or something caught my eyes, but i looked up and on top of that pole sat a man. he looked elderly small, dirty, clothes and all, and have darker skin than most i've seen in that day. at first, he look ahead but suddenly turn his head and lock his glares at me. as soon as i saw that i just picking up my speed and almost got up to sprint at the time i make it out of the school gate. and like all protagonist in the horror films, the young me have to glance back to check only to made an eyes contact with him. after that i ran till out of breath and then realized that, strangely enough, my two friend were ahead of me all those time, sprinting and all. turn out, they also saw the exact same thing but too scare to tell me. but that is the first and last time i ever saw him. as a citizen of a mostly superstitious country, he is some kind of the school guardians, watching and making sure that the kids got out of the school safely, or so it seems.	441	41514	bt3zc7	eou4i5b
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	i saw a non native poison snake in the forest of my old neighborhood, behind a house.it had eggs and it looked at me. i was afraid and ran as fast as my 6 year old legs could take me, told my brother who didn't believe me.the woods where i saw the snake are gone. i have never told this story to anyone besides my brother and feel stupid writing it now. edit: this was in oregon and this is the only snake that isn't a garden snake i have ever seen.	261	41514	bt3zc7	eou7fc5
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	two years ago, i moved out into rural indiana with some of my best friends to share a pretty large apartment that was above my best buddys dads garage. since most of my family is from the area, most of them have known about the house their whole life and all of them pretty much unanimously agreed that it was haunted. before my friends dad moved in, the place had actually been a church. one wing was the actual chapel and the other was living quarters. my mom said multiple exorcisms had been done there and she once watched the double doors to the living quarters fly open and something stomped down some stairs, all during an exorcism. hell, even when i got there, my other friend i was living with showed me the unused concrete basement and in there was a room that seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, bigger than a closet but smaller than a typical room. the only thing in the room was a symbol painted on the middle of the wall that gave us bad vibes. we googled it and turned out to be a symbol that represented some demon who preferred taking childrens souls or some shit (cant remember exactly what it was). anyway, its 1 am and all my roommates are asleep and i decide im going to go outside and smoke some weed and look at the moon and listen to some radiohead to relax myself after work. usually i take our pitbull pup, sweetie, with me and go around the back of the garage towards the forest. sweetie is so well trained that she will stick to you without a leash and typically scares off packs of coyotes that lurk around. however, as im walking towards the forest, sweetie stops and starts whining and wont follow me like she usually does so i tell her to come on but alas, sweetie refuses to go. i take her back to the apartment and have her sit in my bed and she is *shaking* at this point, but stupid me decided it was okay and went back around the garage outside and started walking towards the forest again, but this time i noticed something was walking alongside me (pretty much directly next to me) in my peripheral. i just kept going until something clicked in my head that said you did not imagine that and i turned to see what was next to me. i shit you not, what i saw was a white figure that was as tall as my waist, and it was wearing a dress, then something whispered in my ear and i took off running into the huge backyard area where i usually smoke. but wait, theres more. after smoking a bit and listening to in rainbows for the thousandth time in my life to calm me down, i decide i had to of imagined it and sweetie probably just saw a coyote that was bigger than usual. i decide im done and ready for bed. i had pretty much forgotten the white figure, so i decide ill head back the way i came since its the faster way back to the apartment. this is where most people dont believe me because i was high but in all of my years of smoking weed, i have never experienced something like this. i started walking into the huuuuge open area that has the forest behind it and i saw something running in the darkness. curious me kept watching to see what it was and i could make out two legs and that it was pretty large but full on sprinting. when i noticed that this large, hulking shadow person thing was full on sprinting towards me though and beginning to show itself in the moonlight, i booked it. i could hear something following me all the way back until i got to our door. my friends have told me some of their stories too but no one believes the last part of mine. i know what i saw and i know it was real. weed has never made me hallucinate, i wasnt so tired that i was imagining things, and ive never had this happen to me again after this event. that shit fucking happened.	476	41514	bt3zc7	eou1jz8
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 4/5 i was spending a week at my grandparents house. there was a sort of small shed in the front yard that they used to keep brooms and the odd gardening stuff, and one day i saw that it was unlocked and slightly open (it was usually shut). i went and opened the door more and there was an old man inside. he was dressed in a white shirt and pants, had a long beard, and just kind of stood there in the shed. he didnt say anything or even look directly at me. i ran back inside to tell my grandparents, but when they went outside he wasnt there and didnt believe me. the only evidence was that the shed was unlocked. i had nightmares about that old man basically every night i stayed there from then on. the fact that he didnt seem fazed at all when i opened the shed door and saw him is what freaked me out the most.	49	41514	bt3zc7	eou9jui
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was a kid (probably 4-5), i used to tell my mom that a man would come in my room at night and sit at the foot of my bed. my mom always thought i was just letting my imagination run away with me. then some time later, she was going through old photographs and i pointed at a man and said mommy, thats the man who sits on my bed. it was her father. he had died when she was eight so i had never met him nor did i even know what he looked like. my mom always said she believed in ghosts after that day.	47	41514	bt3zc7	eoudpsp

"not so scary, but today, i was tying my shoelaces to go do some gardening, and as i look towards the clock, out of the corner of my eye, i could've sworn that i saw a black figure dash across the living room really fast. my sister always does this, so i called ""annabelle, where are you?"" and my sister responds from in her room, which is adjacent to the living room, and from my angle, i would've been able to see if anyone were to cross. completely puzzled, and sorta spooked, i turn my head back towards the living room, only to see the figure dash back. &#x200b; haven't told anyone, but am spooked"	43	41514	bt3zc7	eouc0sd
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i moved into my new apartment, my mom gave me her fathers trunk from the vietnam war, which i used as a tv stand. my mom has always lied to me about how he died in the war, however my father enlightened me as to how he committed suicide shortly after he returned home. my mom said she always how she never wanted the trunk and how she always felt odd having it, and told me to get rid of it. but i insisted on keeping it. fast forward to me getting a roommate. i tell him the story of my grandfather and the trunk. he asks if we can go through it, and i said sure. we figured out he killed himself after receiving multiple letters from credit unions regarding credit card fraud. to this day nobody believes my roommate and me, but two hours after we go to bed, i wake up to the absolute deafening blare of an ambulance siren. i mean it gave that uncomfortable rattling deep in your ears that industrial fire alarms do. in a panic i cover my ears and leap out of bed and leave my room. im met with my roommate standing in the hall plugging his ears. the moment we saw each other the siren stopped. we both looked outside, no ambulance. never consulted with neighbors, but when i went to work at my 911 job and asked night shift if they sent anybody to my apartment complex or if a fire alarm went off that night, they said absolutely not. that nights call logs proved them correct. none of my friends believed us but we knew what we heard. it was nuts.	40	41514	bt3zc7	eoujsc7
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was around 12 years old i woke in the middle of the night needing to use the toilet. my room was unusually dark so i quickly got up and walked over to my bedroom door only when i reached for the light switch my hand touched the window which was on the other side of the room. i began to feel incredibly disoriented so i stood still for a minute to let my eyes adjust to the darkness. for some reason the room became darker, i'm talking absolute blackness. i thought that maybe i'd somehow turned around in my sleep and woken up with my head at the bottom of the bed which is why i'd walked to the wrong side of the room. i took a breath and walked to where the door should've been. i reached for the door but could only feel wallpaper. this went on for what felt like half an hour, no matter which direction i went in, i kept ending up on the opposite side of the room to where i should have been. so there i was, sliding my hands around the walls, frantically trying to find my bedroom door. at this point i'm terrified and crying. i stumbled back in to the middle of the room and got back in to bed. after my heart stopped racing i decided to try again. this time, my bedroom door was right where it had always been. i turned on the light, my pillows were were at the correct end of the bed, everything was in it's place. it was the freakiest experience and i slept with my door open for years after.	41	41514	bt3zc7	eouk4ls
[serious] whats the creepiest/scariest thing youve seen but no one believes you?	when i was about 4 or 5, this guy used to come to my window every night. the first time, my curtains were closed, and i heard a little tapping sound. my bed was right against the window, so i rolled over and opened the curtains, thinking it was one of my brothers being stupid. it was some dude i didn't know, at eye level with me. then, while holding eye contact with me, he started doing what looked like sign language. it went on for a few minutes, then he nodded at me and walked off. happened the next night, and the night after that, and for the next three months until we moved away. the window was open; if he'd wanted to abduct me, he could have at any time. every damn day i told my family, and they never once believed me about the sign language guy. they used to call him my imaginary friend, and to this day, they tell me i made it all up. i was wide awake, and i know what the hell i saw, though.	38	41514	bt3zc7	eoukzpm

"a huge part of the bachelorette was scripted. the company i worked for at the time was a major tourism service provider and featured prominently in one of the seasons. we were all pulled into meetings with the higher up managers, given a speel about what was in our best interest. and spilling any secrets was punishable by a $5mil lawsuit, ""please sign here"". i gave 0 fucks about the show at the time. still don't. just wanted to do my job. the ""bachelorette"" herself was clearly there to further her public profile or ""acting"" career. the scenes were always ""set up"" before filming. behind the camera nothing was happening. the cast were told where to go, what to do and how to do it. if half those guys weren't on their phones texting their real girlfriends most of the time, i would be surprised. so fake. so 100% fake. &#x200b; edit: well, this is getting a lot more attention than i thought it would. here's a few tidbits: the nda was only that we wouldn't spill secrets about the show before episodes involving our company aired. we were also not allowed to 'disparage' the company, which honestly was easy to abide by since we were treated well and we had excellent managers. the 'bachelorette' has since gone on to a fairly successful tv career, hosting several shows. all of her official press credits ""the bachelorette"" and her exposure during another elimination style reality tv show with launching her career."	10756	52694	buluna	epem5cv

(total bs. i liked the dentist, and i was a people pleaser. also, laughing gas). my moms lawyer was super pessimistic and told her just to settle and sign an nda because she had a small chance of winning. so my mom settled, being naive and scared to take on an office full of liars. she could never disclose who the dentist was, and weve heard other horror stories throughout the years about this dentist effing up other peoples mouths. it sucks because every lawyer weve talked to after-the-fact says we had a very strong case and its likely we would have won. like really won.	1155	52694	buluna	epf6za6

people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	i used to work for a company in the middle east that provided relocation services to people in america. we represented 3 main companies under 9 different names which changed every so often when the reviews got really bad. we had receptionists whose main task, aside from damage control, was to write a few extremely positive reviews for each company every single day in order to counter all the negative ones. i worked in sales. our job was to catalog everything our clients wanted to move and then provide the best possible price while lying through our teeth about the service itself. we promised professional movers who had all the necessary training and tools for the job, great prices, quick deliveries, you name it. on moving day, the movers who showed up were often in unmarked trucks or ones with completely different names and branding on them. the workers were often immigrants who were paid under-the-table and had no experience whatsoever. the deliveries themselves often took a long time and items were often lost as multiple moves would be stacked into one truck without much labeling of items or categorizing in general. as mentioned earlier, we changed company names fairly often as the negative reviews and bad press stacked up. moving is a toxic business, and people will always try to undermine and cheat. this is something you should never cheap out on as the money is well worth the comfort of knowing your move is in good hands. if you are moving, i recommend finding a company that is local if possible, so that you can meet the people who represent it and see that their business is legitimate. more importantly, they will be able to send someone to survey your belongings and give a more realistic quote and time estimate. even if it costs much more than the quotes you receive online or from salesmen, it is well worth the peace of mind on an already stressful venture. edit: spelling and grammar	110	52694	buluna	epf2e5r

people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	&#x200b; when i was in high school this kid kept bragging about joining the russian mob. he was kind of a shit head. sold drugs. and way more than just pot. no one really believed him. and then one day he disappeared off the face of the earth. this was a while ago. i'm in my 30s now. so no facebook, no proliferation of cell phones. one day he was just gone from our lives. well, turned out somewhere up the chain of drug dealer scum this kid really did have connections to the russian mob. they offered to let him in. told him he'd make tons of money. people would respect and fear him. girls would suck his dick 24/7. whatever he wanted. all they wanted from him was to show his loyalty by doing a hit. mother fucker was 17. he killed some rival drug dealer or something stupid like that. the russians set him up and let him take the fall. this was over 20 years ago. he's still in prison. he will never leave. and that was just one fucking day in the lives of the people that dumbass looked up to. i didn't breach an nda but i think 20 years later the russian mob probably isn't going to kill me for talking on reddit. so it kinda fits.	6671	52694	buluna	epdvok6

people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	"my old company i sold mattresses for are still the most overpriced places ever and heavily rely on having their own ""exclusive"" beds so they can't price match. i've sold one for nearly half price and still made decent commission. also, the exclusive beds they sell are exactly the same as the ones in other places, but maybe just rearranged the foam cushions or just got em in different colors and that's it, but they'll be priced an extra few hundred bucks. we were told that tempurpedic messed up and that's why they dropped them as a vendor, when in all reality, the company made demands and tempursealy refused to screw over their other customers and dropped the contract. we sold clearance beds. we had to say they were overstocks, floor models that never made it to the floors, rejected deliveries, etc. truth is, sure, a handful we're floor models, but 95% of em we're returns that people slept on for a minimum of 30 days. and no, they were never cleaned. just sprayed with what's essentially an industrial version of a knock off lysol with reduced scent so it's not obvious. idk how they haven't gotten caught by the health department yet. and finally, if you go to a mattress place for a new bed, don't go for anything priced less than $1k. they're shit. instead, find a $1200 one and haggle em down to about $7-800. you're welcome."	82	52694	buluna	epf85ho

people who have signed ndas that have now expired or for whatever reason are no longer valid. what couldn't you tell us but now can?	"i had to sign an nda in the army when i was tasked to a special training area that was set up for combat medics. they would take goats and put them into a chemically induced coma. then they would first cut off their limbs to practice proper tourniquet application. then they cut open their stomachs and pulled out intestines to practice evisceration bandaging (fyi, never stuff it back in, you only apply a bandage). there were other things that were not as gruesome like getting a saline lock for iv drips and practicing ncd for tension pneumothorax (hole in the lungs). after they were euthanized they were thrown into a large ""kicker box"" and packed with ice to slow decomposition. &#x200b; the nda was to keep the public from finding out this was going on and potentially stopping the training event. i'm kinda on the fence about the morality of it. on one hand, it's kinda fucked up. there's no other way to put it. but on the other hand, i would prefer a medic who went through that kind of training to come to my aid if i caught a bullet to the chest. i know the training is gruesome but has its benefits and has definitely saved lives on the battlefield. &#x200b; \*edit to address the three main questions flooding my inbox: the reason you don't stuff it back in is explained pretty well by u/d-usa where he says: >there are two main concerns for emergency treatment: keep it moist (drying out delicate tissue like that will kill it), and dont do anything to restrict blood flow. if you try to shove it back in you can easily end up twisting it or pinching it off, and then blood cant flow and tissue ends up dying. also, i know it's not a well-kept secret and everyone knows about it. the purpose of the nda is to keep it a secret long enough to finish training without peta and other extremists from picketing outside the gates. i fully agree that human lives and medical advancement are well worth the sacrifice of these animals."	11086	52694	buluna	epe4s2a

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"* signal clearly when waiting at the stop that you want my bus - i can't read your mind or stop on a sixpence when you wave frantically at the last minute (if the bus stop says request stop, then you have to request the bus to stop!) * have you pass/fare ready before boarding, especially if the bus is stuck in the traffic waiting to serve the bus stop, you can see the bus is there so don't wait until you're at the driver to route through your bag or do the pocket strip tease. * if you have young kids please keep them seated. i don't mind crying, singing or loud kids, but kids running around the bus means that i will pull up at the next safe point and won't move until you either seat them or remove yourself and them from the bus. * if you need extra time to get seated or for me to lower the bus just ask. the extra 20-30 seconds it will take is nothing compared to the paperwork we have to fill out if you have an accident on the bus. * please don't crowd the doors if there is room on the bus, it causes delays as people getting on and off have to push past you - and i will request you to take a seat if there is one. * if you have a question for me please ask when getting on, not when i'm driving, also don't expect me to be an oracle and getting pissed because i don't now where every side street or pub is. edit - thanks for the gold, and to clarify the first point which has rubbed some people the wrong way - at every bus stop that i approach i check the stop and around it for ""intending passengers"", if you're nonchalantly sitting there playing on your phone in a world of you own chances are i'll go past you, but if you look like you want my bus i'll stop. i will stop at any bus stop with a person with a cane, guide dog, wheelchair or mobility aid or a crowded bus stop. in london most bus stops service several routes at once and my bus route is a high frequency route (a bus every 4 minutes during the peak). my point of signalling clearly means that i don't have to read between the lines and i can be certain that somebody wants my bus at that particular stop."	21513	39097	bp9xm7	enqqwfg

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	its been said already, but to reiterate: 1. ring the bell, pull the cord, push the button (however it works on your bus) for your stop at least a block or two before we actually get to the stop . and even if its a stop we will make anyway. drivers cant read your minds, so signaling will let us know you want to get off the bus. signaling as we pass your stop is pointless, because. 2. buses cant stop on a dime! dont step out in front of a bus and expect us to stop safely for you. also, after getting off the bus, dont cross in front of us! either cross behind us or wait for us to pass. its too easy for us to run you over. 3. if you see your bus at your stop, board quickly. we are on a schedule and cannot wait around for everyone to lollygag their way to the stop. hurry up and get to the bus. youre holding up the bus and everyone on it. 4. if youre the only one standing at a stop served by multiple routes and im a bus that you *dont* want, signal to me that you dont want my bus so i dont have to waste my time stopping for you. shake your head, turn away from us, step away from the stop, or something. 5. buses are not taxis. we have routes, schedules, and designated stops. if you are on the street in between stops and see a bus you need or want, dont flag them down and expect them to stop for you. many times our policies dont permit us to stop anywhere except a designated bus stop. 6. we are most likely not the last bus that will ever service your stop. so if you miss your bus, or if we leave before you make it to the stop, dont try to sprint to catch up with us. wait for the next one! and if you really need to catch my bus at that very moment, be on time to the stop! 7. when the bus is crowded, please move as far back as you can to allow people to get on the bus. there is no stigma to sitting in the back of the bus. 8. when exiting the bus, use the back doors unless you need special attention offboarding, e.g., if youre in a wheelchair, use a walker, or otherwise require us to kneel the bus (which can only be done at the front). 9. when boarding a bus with a special needs passenger who is offboarding, wait for them to get off and clear the bus before you push your way on. 10. be considerate of other people! this is not your personal limousine. this is public space. not everyone wants to watch you eat or hear your music or watch your videos. 11. if you clip your nails on my bus, i will kick you the fuck off it. that is just plain disgusting. take care of your personal hygiene in a proper bathroom somewhere else! 12. if you need help with anything, especially route information, never hesitate to ask the driver. nine times out of ten, they will be happy to help. 13. but please dont distract us for too long. we cant be your therapist and safely operate the bus at the same time. (nor would many of us want to.) 14. we are people too, not your servants, so please be kind and courteous to us. we may be in a service position, but that doesnt mean we have to take your shit. 15. this is a large vehicle, not a jungle gym. find a seat and sit in it. do not swing yourself from the bars. if you cannot sit down, hold on to something! this list is way longer than i thought it would be!	1509	39097	bp9xm7	enr4iwp
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i used to be a bus driver years ago. i usually found other drivers far more annoying than passengers, but one thing i disliked was when a long line of people would get on and each ask where the bus was going. like, a) there's a sign on the outside of the bus that tells you this, and b) you *just* heard ten other people ask that question and get exactly the same answer. edit: i think a lot of you are misunderstanding what i'm saying. there is a big difference (to me, at least) between asking ""where does this bus go?"", which is very frustrating, and asking ""does this bus go to [some specific place]?"", which is fine."	11677	39097	bp9xm7	enqna5j

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i drove for my college's transportation system, so there were no fares to ride. one thing that's a given on most public transportation systems is the courtesy of letting the people currently on the bus get off before you try to get on; this was very difficult for college kids for some reason, and it was compounded by the fact that you can board through both the front and the back door, so we'd have people trying to squeeze their way on (at both doors) while there were still people getting off. it's a pipe dream, but that problem would go away completely if everyone would just board in the front and exit in the back. such a simple solution that sadly will never, ever happen because people are too {insert adjective}. also, when you get on the bus (or are already on it), and the bus is getting full so you're standing, and there are more people coming on, **move toward the back**. i had to sit there and talk to these people (of all ages) like children, ""please move back and make room,"" because they simply were unaware that they were standing directly in the way of like 20 people trying to board when there's still plenty of room on the bus. i guess, if i can sum it all up, just pay attention, and realize that you're not the only person on the bus."	178	39097	bp9xm7	enqzxyq

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i wonder if it's a british thing. but whenever get the bus, we don't stand in line or form an orderly queue, rather just mill around or stand wherever. however while doing that we will have taken note of exactly who was there before we were. so when the bus arrives a queue will spontaneously form with everyone in the exact order of arrival.	346	39097	bp9xm7	enr08ra
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	not a driver, but a regular bus-user who would like to post something on behalf of the drivers. if the bus is late due to traffic, this is not the driver's fault!!! so many people get on my bus and give the driver an earful when the bus is late. do you really think that driver has control over the traffic buildup in the two cities that the bus travels between? do you think that the driver has the ability to magically fly over the cars in order to get to your bus stop in time? the driver is enjoying this traffic even less than you are. they have no control over it. give him/her a break. at least you have the option to get off and walk.	1187	39097	bp9xm7	enqvgg6
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	one thing i would of liked people to know when i was driving was that once the doors are closed and were pulling away, its too dangerous to re-open the doors and let you on. were not being dicks by driving off. too many accidents happen when people ignore this and its the driver that gets the blame.	1111	39097	bp9xm7	enqu6ki

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	i used to be a bus driver and now work in management for a public transit agency. i always feel the worst for drivers when they get chewed out for things they cannot control, like running late. there are times where theres a big event in town and traffic is at a complete standstill and people get mad at the driver because the bus is late. like, what.? also, most bus drivers are some of the nicest, hardest working people ive ever met. its not easy to drive a bus and have the safety of so many people in your hands (not just on the bus, but anyone around the bus). give them the benefit of the doubt as much as possible. also, public transit is extremely underfunded. buses are built to last 12 years but many (pretty much all) agencies have to run buses much longer because of lack of funding. this means buses break down more and end up costing more in the long run due to maintenance. i just had a call the other day where someone complained the bus they rode on was old and dirty and just trash. that bus is almost 20 years old; we dont choose to keep it around because we want to, but because we have to. so many people in the community really rely on public transit but there are political groups actively trying to reduce funding to make public transit worse. i feel bad for the people who really need it. public transit constantly gets requests for more service, or to expand it to areas where it isnt, but they cant because theres not enough funding. theres plenty of money in the economy, but politicians prioritize other things. please speak up to your representatives to provide more funding for public transit. ppublix transit is full of hard working people trying to do the right thing to improve lives in the community and provide opportunity.	56	39097	bp9xm7	enr6fce

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	if it's a bus stop with multiple routes, please wave me off if you dont want to get on my bus. pulling to the curb and then reentering traffic is time consuming and dangerous. please don't stand at the edge of the curb for the bus. most large buses have their wheels behind the first 3-4 feet if the bus body. to get completely out of traffic and enter the stop i must often swing the bus nose over the curb. you can be bonked by the mirror or hit by the bus bumper. please get out of the way. we cannot pick you up if you aren't at the stop. seriously, we can be reprimanded or fired for such action, don't get mad.	84	39097	bp9xm7	enraupf

"my bf is a busdriver, i asked him to answer this. his answer (translated to english ofc): i wish customers know i'm not google maps. people literally get mad at me for not knowing obscure street a in faraway village y. i just drive past through there, i don't live there :') in the same spirit: i also don't know where all my collegues are at any time, so no, i don't know when bus x, y, z is coming, or why they're late. neither do i know at what time bus 43 is supposed to depart at obscure-middle-of-nowhere busstop. we (as in, society) have booklets and infosigns and the internet for that to look it up. because seriously, busdrivers aren't gonna memorise all thousands of busstops and accompanying arrival and departure times, only for them to change every year again. (note from me: people sometimes seriously get aggressive if a driver can't answer such a question!) also, even if the ""do not talk with driver"" sign is on, we still appreciate it when you shout a ""thank you!"" or a ""have a nice day"" to us. we're people too you know :) tl;dr: busdrivers aren't computers, look your own shit up."	45	39097	bp9xm7	enrc6it

bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	im a bus driver from a city of ~90k. for the most part, people say hello, goodbye, and thank you, and as a driver it is appreciated. one thing i wish customers knew is that sometimes youll see a bus driver stop at a coffee shop and come out with a coffee. 99% of the time, the stop wasnt to get a coffee. during my shift, (540a-240p) i get off my bus for one 35-40 minute break. if i have to use a restroom outside of that break, i may have to use a coffee shop for that purpose. these coffee shops usually know whats up, and drivers tend to know the ones that have good, clean washrooms. they dont get paid by my employer for allowing us to use their facilities, and to keep them clean, so we feel kinda of obligated to purchase something when we use their establishment. even in a city of my size, we still get people taking photos of our drivers walking to or from a shop with a coffee or something. it sucks to get hammered in the press because you had to take a leak and couldnt hold it.	8	39097	bp9xm7	enrcdg0
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	finally a thread i have an answer for. i drive a school bus for an afterschool program. my biggest problem is with other drivers on the road. it's like no one understands how to drive around bigger vehicles. like i need people to understand that i may be slower on the road, but i'm also slower to break than you as well. and not all drivers of big vehicles are innocent. a lot of them don't know how to properly drive them either.	8	39097	bp9xm7	enrcye8
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	the rules on the bus don't exist because i'm an assshole. they exist for my safety and your safety. i'm a bus driver, not a babysitter. if i'm focusing my attention on you breaking the rules, then i'm not focusing on the road. and i want to keep my job so when people break the rules i have to do something. my bus has 8 cameras with full audio and they investigate every complaint. all it takes is one call in saying someone was breaking the rules in that bus driver did nothing. so next time you're eating on the bus, or have your music up too loud, or talking on your cell phone, swearing, know that i'm not calling you out to be a jerk. i just want to keep my job and be safe.	9	39097	bp9xm7	enrv8he
bus drivers of reddit, what is something you wish customers knew, or would do more?	"i've been working on public transit for about six years now. i operated streetcars that functioned like buses (a stop at every block, but they don't stop unless there's demand for it), buses, and light rail trains now. operators can be kind of petty because we work a somewhat thankless job. 1) if you want terrible service, be sure to remind the operator that he's late. i've gotten stuck in traffic, or stuck behind another train that broke down, or any number of things that i couldn't do a damn thing about. once i'm on the move again, there's always at least one person who looks at me sternly and taps their watch. i get it, i'm late. the little trip computer has been showing negative numbers for the last fifteen minutes; it's hard to miss. by doing this, i specifically remember you. if there's a point in the future where i'm on time and you're not, i won't wait for you now because you annoyed the hell out of me. 2) if you want great service, bring food. sealed food is the best. a bottle of soda where the seal hasn't been popped, an unopened bag of chips or whatnot can help a lot. i'll not even joking when i said i had a regular that brought me a big cookie once, and two weeks later i didn't see him at his usual station. i did, however, see him running up from about a block away. since he was actually running and had brought me good food, we all waited for him even though it made me a little late. i made up the time quickly enough though. 3) stop requests are important. if you're on a route that has stops in every block, we're not stopping at each one every time. pull the cord, push the button, even saying ""next stop, please!"" is enough communication. standing behind me is not. do you want a better view of where you're going because you're lost? do you want the next stop? or what about the stop after that? if you stand there silently, i know nothing. 4) hearing music on the bus and train sucks because 99% of time it's not music you like. shut that shit off, an don't you dare get upset when the operator or another passenger asks you to be a decent human being and turn it off. 5) the trains i run now have very limited rearward visibility from the cab. a lot of stuff happens behind me that i miss. if you see someone unload bodily fluids onto the train, let the operator know. i wouldn't want to ride a train with vomit all over the floor, and i don't expect you all to either. 6) holding the door for your buddy who is late or was hanging out on the wrong side of the platform is a dick move and i don't know if any train operator who doesn't wish misfortune upon those who do it. i personally try to limit the amount of misfortune i wish upon these people to ""i hope a bird shits on your head"" but man, if you do this at the wrong time, you could probably bottle my rage and sell it as a renewable energy source."	9	39097	bp9xm7	ensaflr

what's the dumbest thing you've ever done because your brain was on autopilot?	i went on a road trip and lost my laptop, but didn't know how i'd done it. i remembered carrying it to the car, i never used it at my destination, and yet it wasn't with me or at home. it was odd - i could picture carrying the laptop, but couldn't picture it in the car. i filed a list item report with police, checked warranties, even shopped around for a new one. then one night i stumbled upon a craigslist lost and found page, and saw my laptop had been found. it was cracked across the screen and dented in a corner. when i left for the trip, autopilot me evidently (and literally never do this with any item, ever) placed the laptop on top of the car, got in the car, and drove away, dropping it on the street to be incredibly luckily retrieved before being driven over. i was reunited with it about two weeks after having lost it.	157	29681	btfu8k	eoy61yf

what's the dumbest thing you've ever done because your brain was on autopilot?	first year in public school (i transferred in the sixth grade), i was invited to someone's table to sit (not the first time it happened). if i was awkward in private school, i was definitely known as the weird kid in junior high. i also tended to space out, a habit i'd picked up at some point in my development. so i'm at this table, it's mostly a table of girls, and i'm quiet around them. i space out into my own little world. but when i come to, i realize i'm apparently gazing straight at a girl across from me. and what more, she's looking straight back at me with a really concerned and unsure look on my face. someone eventually told me that she'd found me creepy, which i couldn't blame for. but we ended up friends in the later half of high school. i also once took my dog's medication instead of benadryl. that might've been a funnier story in hindsight.	26	29681	btfu8k	eoy1ddh

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	don't know how major or interesting this is but in athens in the area of faliro () (which used to be the port of ancient athens before it was moved to piraeus) during some excavations for the construction of a cultural center, a huge cemetery was discovered. an entire year of construction was put on hold (and this is a frequent problem in athens, major construction work running into ancient buried buildings which now have to be preserved). apparently the cemetery is interesting not only because it hosts many dead babies and children, which were buried inside vessels, (infant mortality rate was very high) but also many prisoners and criminals who were executed. there's also a mass grave of about 80 shackled men. it has been speculated the mass grave may be related to cylon of athens, a winner in the olympics and wannabe tyrant, who tried to stage a coup by taking over the acropolis but was promptly chased out of there by megacles (of a powerful athenian clan) and escaped to megara. his followers sought refuge in the altar of athena polias. anyone present at an altar was considered to be under the protection of the gods, and was not allowed to be harmed. they agreed to descend the acropolis afted being promised they would be left unharmed but were slaughtered nonetheless by the followers of megacles, as they considered the men unworthy of the gods' protection.	608	31178	bsahi8	eomkkx6
archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	i'm primarily an egyptologist but i work for a uk regional archaeology crew, and recently they found a specific vessel which was very unusual. its hard to describe but i couldn't find a picture, but it was a smallish clay pot, which had been made on a wheel and was incredibly well-made, but the neck of it was tiny, and it pinched in and out at points. bad description i know. anyway, we got it dated to around the stuart era, and gave it over to a potter who we sometimes worked with, so he could attempt to make a copy. he couldn't do it. he made a lovely pot, but it was nothing like the original. he explained that he couldn't get the clay thin enough to pinch like the original, because his hands were simply too big to make a pot with a neck of that size. so after a lot of thought they came to a conclusion that it must have been children making these pots (i suggested women but it turned out even womens hands were too big). based on other circumstantial evidence from the same context, this was from a relatively poor family, who trained their children in the same trade as them to create beautiful pottery to sell to the elites. in the stuart era, that style of pottery was around a lot, but it had started not too far from the city we found it in, so we figured they must have been copying the popular style. it's so interesting to think that a child, probably no more than 8, made such a beautiful piece of work. edit - just adding for clarification as it seems to have confused some people - when i said i'm an egyptologist, i mean that's my main link to archaeology. the pot i'm talking about here is from a regional archaeology find - it's stuart, as in its english and dates from the 15th/16th centuries. its not egyptian, just to clear up any confusion!	4912	31178	bsahi8	eom7yaa

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	okay i've got another one related to my actual degree (egyptology). the tomb of neithhotep was discovered in the early 1900's, but it was badly damaged and therefore we're still investigating all the material we have. a lot of it was burnt by tomb robbers but there is still some epigraphic evidence. one of the most interesting pieces is a tiny piece of pottery with a serekh on it, the symbol of the name of the king. for context, neithhotep was from predynastic egypt, just before the first dynasty. and this is where it gets exciting - neithhotep is believed to be the mother of the first pharaoh of egypt. however, on this piece of pottery, her name is written in a serekh. indicating she was a pharaoh. of course its possible that it was just indicating her as queen, but it's quite fun to think that there's a very good chance the first pharaoh of egypt was a woman. furthermore, as far as we can tell, this is the earliest ever surviving evidence of a woman's name written down. we all thought that was pretty cool.	1286	31178	bsahi8	eom8llu

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	it's difficult to talk about things that have been found in the field, but not formally published. the act of publishing is where all the background information, theoretical models, data collection, and analysis go to offer interpretations of finds found in the field. like, you may have found a tomb, but you can't say much more than it is a tomb, the location, and a general overview of the contents without sitting down and doing the analysis of the mortuary goods, the skeletal remains, and the soils and then comparing all of that to other known excavated tombs to find similarities and differences on a regional, temporal, and/or cultural scale. so as a rule, archaeologists tend not to talk about things they found in the field until they've had a chance to do all that work and get a publication either in the process of being published (review and edit stage) or the publication is scheduled to come out soon in the next issue of a journal. there's a lot more work that goes into archaeology than many people realize. it's not just digging in the dirt, giving what you find a cursory glance, and making broad sweeping proclamations about the past. there's radiocarbon samples, ceramic sherds, chert/obsidian, bones, metal, fibers, soil, pollen, faunal remains, floral remains, etc. that can and is tested to inform us about the dates of occupation, where clay or chert/obsidian sources are located, the dna of a person or the stable isotope value that indicates where they grew up, the sources of metals, what plants or animals make up the preserved fibers, chemical signatures in the soil that may indicate certain kinds of activity, the types of plants being grown nearby, and the animals and plants people consumed. it's a monumental undertaking to do archaeology. that being said, i could talk about some recent work that i've done and presented on at a conference if anyone is still interested.	706	31178	bsahi8	eokwrjb

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	not and archaeologist and was not really hidden, but near me, in 2017, a guy found a huge unexploded bomb from ww2, which he dug out with counstruction machines and took pictures, drove it arround and whatnot. it had a ~~20km~~ blast radius, so it would be pretty dangerous, had it exploded. made big news back in the summer of 17 in slovenia lol. e: it was a 230kg bomb, they evacuated a 1km radius, memory is a funny thing.	41	31178	bsahi8	eomcwup

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	in the 1960s two (headless) skeletons were found in a latrine of a house on the greek island of delos. this is a big deal because delos was a sacred island and no one could be buried there, instead there was a cemetery on the neighbor island. but what is even more interesting is the excavators could not find the heads anywhere. but what is even more interesting is that within this house was the largest single collection of phallus (erect penis) statues. so fast forward to 2014, excavations were beginning again at this same house and they found the heads!!!! two rooms over. it has been suggested that because of their unusual burial context (in the latrine), the fact that they were decapitated, and the fact that they were on delos at all indicated that these two individuals were murdered! next week i will be helping catalogue and analyze the skeletons- very exciting! unfortunately for ethical reason i will most likely not be able to post photos. tldr; two decapitated skeletons found in the toilet in a penis filled house in delos. edit: 1960s here is an chapter about them: https://books.google.gr/books?id=llgmawaaqbaj&pg=pt120&lpg=pt120&dq=two+decapitated+skeletons+delos+greece&source=bl&ots=sclhwebdqx&sig=acfu3u0i2vvzqinnhrenseibm3xz_0y3ow&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdt8_vobtiahvdpvakhamrbiwq6aewcxoecacqaq#v=onepage&q=two%20decapitated%20skeletons%20delos%20greece&f=false	39	31178	bsahi8	eon4iuj

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	in april 2019, a new hominid species (human species) was declared in the philippines. this has been ongoing research since 2007 but the research study was only recently unveiled to the world. this species shares commonalities with many of its contemporary humanoids (sapiens, neadertalensis, floresiensis). with the current finds, it is believed that h. luzonesis was short (less than 4 ft. tall) just like its indonesian cousin h. floresiensis. it's quite a fascinating research, here's a short video describing what we know so far https://youtu.be/mgn2dvdywgc	17	31178	bsahi8	eon6jj1

archaeologists of reddit, what are some latest discoveries that the masses have no idea of?	they recently discovered possible evidence that there were humans 100,000 years ago in the americas. in san diego they found evidence of what we think are tools made of mastodon bone. so essentially archaeologists are stubborn just like any other type of ideology on academia and theyre reluctant to let go of the theories that dominated the 20th century. for example weve always been taught clovis first meaning the first people to populate the americas were the clovis people 10-12k years ago. but now there is overwhelming evidence the americas were populated before that and possibly all the way back to 100,000 years ago which would completely change our understanding of humans.	124	31178	bsahi8	eolxusw

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"back during wow's second expansion there was this guy in my guild i'd become friends with mostly through other friends. we talked more and more over time and became fairly close. he had this asshole roommate, and i could hear the guy sometimes, especially when something went wrong during a raid. he'd scream and throw fits, he was pretty awful sounding. my friend told me he wasn't just loud and obnoxious, but verbally and sometimes physically abusive, too. i had my own apartment, so i said you know what, come stay with me. just long enough to get you on your feet and into a place that's safe. he showed up at my place with a trash bag full of his stuff and a laptop. i set him up in the apartment and started trying to help him find a job. well, he did not want a job. he did not get a job, either. he sat in my apartment, day after day, eating my food and slowly draining my savings. no matter how hard i tried to get him motivated, he would just dig in his heels and somehow become more sedentary. eventually i told him he had to go. i couldn't afford to keep him there. he was just couch surfing. i spoke to some people and eventually pieced together that his method of securing a new ""temporary"" place was playing on the sympathies of his friends to convince them he was in a terrible living situation. it just worked really well on me because he had that loud, obnoxious roommate to play off of. he wound up calling a nearby relative to come and get him, i think his aunt. i don't know what he told her i supposedly did, but i have never seen a more venomous look from someone in my life. as far as i know he moved in with his sister and brother in law after that, but frankly i don't care where he ended up. he also stole a bunch of my stuff. first and last time i do anything like that."	1340	20447	bqhfq9	eo5cbqu
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is more of an embarrassment story. when i was in high school in the 90s i was active on the local dial up bbs scene. i was friends with someone who went by the handle venus. i knew she was a woman but had no idea what she looked like. i also knew she was dating a guy in real life with the handle lord gumby who was also a friend online. being a socially misadjusted 15 year old i had a crush on her anyway even though i knew they were both like 18. this was like 1992 so privacy wasnt as big a concern and they knew my address. this was also when people would randomly come by your house to see if you were home. thats unfathomable today. so one saturday morning im at home on my computer totally disheveled, unshowered, and just gross in ratty sweatpants and no shirt. i hear a knock on the front door and go open it. theres a woman who was incredibly beautiful standing there and she just goes hi! im venus! i stood there for a minute it seemed like jaw dropped trying to say something when lord gumby walked up and was like hey doofus, ever met a woman before? needless to say i wanted to sink into a hole in the ground and die. but i hung out with them and i guess i wasnt too horrible because we hung out a lot after that. but that whole time i was like fuck my life choices! havent talked to them in decades. i wonder how theyre doing.	2238	20447	bqhfq9	eo5dxlj
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"met this dude on everquest and we've played games together ever since. been a part of the same guild, help each other out on mobile games, and have conversations about life in general. it isn't him that's the horror story, it was his mom! so one day, i think we were playing wow at the time, i log on to do some quests. suddenly his user comes on and ask to chat by video. we've done this before and there's no problem but after i click to start the video chat: there's his mom butt naked on the screen. she asks me to watch her masturbate and i'm like ""no lady this is just awkward af"" and i log off for a few days. i get an email from my friend and he wants to know why i haven't shown up for quests or anything. so i tell him what happened and he is seriously like ""wtf?"" turns out his mom had been doing this to a lot of his online buddies and she eventually goes to prison for raping a minor or two. buddy's doing great though: wife and kids plus we still play the occasional game together."	1071	20447	bqhfq9	eo5jtwn
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i never actually met the guy, but spoke to him on the phone. wed met on myspace when i was in college and exchanged email addresses when we realized we lived in the same town. eventually, i gave him my phone number and made plans for him to call me. when he did, his voice creeped me out. it was how i imagined a serial killer would sound. by the time i got passed it and was comfortable talking to him on the phone i started noticing other red flags. whenever i brought the neighborhood up, he changed the subject. at one point, i asked him what his favorite restaurant on the boulevard was and he hedged, so i made up a restaurant that i said was my favorite. he immediately said that was his favorite too and that he especially loved one of their dishes. he went on and on about this wonderful place that didnt exist (and there wasnt a similar one in town, so he couldnt be confused). i called him out on the fact that hed obviously never been to my neighborhood. turned out, he didnt even live in the same state as me.	328	20447	bqhfq9	eo5hlqx

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"guy i knew in college met a girl online and spent every day talking about her. she lived about 6 hours away, so he planned to take a semester off and pursue this relationship. he got a job in her town and asked if i'd hep him mov out there since my car would hold more than he could take on a bus. i had a long weekend off and figured, why not? a road trip cold be fun. i'd drive him out as a goodbye present, and the way back i planned to visit yellowstone. well. we arrive and it turns out he doesn't have an apartment lined up and. he found a job *posting* in his girlfriend's town, he hadn't actually gotten the job. or even applied yet. i make a bunch of phone calls and find him a room to rent that will let him move in that day with just first, last, and deposit, even without a job. i'm tired and disgusted with his lack of planning, but figure it's worth staying the night and trying to end things on good terms with my buddy. then he breaks down and confesses that he hasn't actually met this girl. the nights he spent ""video chatting"" with her were really just him watching her vlog and jacking it. they've never talked. never texted. never even emailed. hell, he's never even left so much as a comment or ""like"" on one of her videos. she genuinely didn't (still doesn't) know he existed. his plan was to hang out at this game shop she talks a lot about until she showed up and someohow create a relationship from that. he thought that they'd meet and she'd fall in love with him and move back to our college town to marry him. all before the next semester began. that didn't happen. instead, i made my ""buddy"" buy a bus ticket for his ride back to school and left. he came back to school and got more cringey, not less. i lost track of him after that."	17609	20447	bqhfq9	eo589ud

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	when i was younger i met an online friend in a public place for the first time. he was about my age and hadnt lied about that, so i guess i let my guard down. anyway, after we walked for awhile i notice he had led me down a dark alley with no other people. he then looked at me and said how he really wanted to rape me right then and there. right after hed said that, my instinct kicked in, and i ran as fast as ive ever run in my life, until i came to the train station. here i jumped on the first train i saw and got the hell away from him.	259	20447	bqhfq9	eo5wdmr
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is way back in the mid 90s. bulletin board systems were all the rage. i made friends with this guy from nc - he was friends with a bunch of us from my dorm, mostly females, which should probably have been a red flag but i was extremely naive at the time. a couple months in, he mentioned he was coming to our state for a wedding and asked if he could come by our college to meet everyone. it was agreed hed sleep in my dorm room since my roommate was almost never around. now, there was no discussion or thought of sex, but i was pretty excited to meet this guy and see if he was as funny and charming as he was online. well. day arrives, dude shows up. i should mention that i and all my college friends were 18 or 19, this guy was 24. or so he said. guy looked like, and im not exaggerating, a cancer patient. pale, gaunt features, long greasy pale blond hair except where he was bald on top, and just generally looked like he was about to die or he was dressed as a ghoul for halloween. he insisted on hugging all of us. i was trying to remind myself that looks dont matter and that he was a cool guy despite his very unsettling appearance. but then, when we all started hanging out, things just got worse. he was asking really invasive questions of all of us, making weird comments to whatever was said, just all around creepy and distressing. i was sitting on the floor with another friend and actively rocking back and forth from discomfort. i lied and said i had hurt my back and that sleeping on the floor helped, because that night he kept insisting we could share my tiny twin college bed. nope nope nope nope nope. last time i ever met anyone from that site.	12646	20447	bqhfq9	eo4xb92
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	he and i were part of the same forum many, many years ago. he was dealing with his issues and i was dealing with mine. i think we both went there to escape, where people wouldnt judge. also, because we were bored. im not quite sure when we got properly talking, i think its when he told a terrible joke about kipper ties. we used to share everything with each other, over msn. id give him advice about his love life and hed listen to all my fuck ups. it took quite a few fuck ups before we eventually met up. i think i already knew we were in love but seeing him in person really cemented it. we decided to give it a go, even though we lived 300 miles away from each other. we had a lot of ups and downs. i was distant, he lived with his ex girlfriend for a bit even though she didnt have a job and couldnt afford her half of the rent. the same ex gf who id given him advice on, who he had nicknamed trouble and liked to claim she was pregnant every so often. we got over that, along with many other things, and finally moved in with each other. i thought our issues were gonna be solved when there was no distance between us. ends up, we were just very different people who wanted very different things and the distance wasn't gonna change that. we broke up after three and a half years together. none of thats the horror story. not the way he treated me, not the fact he probably cheated on me, not that i wasnt a priority and used to cry myself to sleep. about a year and a half after breaking up, he gets back in touch and we talk like it was in the beginning, when we were friends. after a few weeks, he asked if i want to get back together. i said no. i told him that hed broken my heart again. the next day, i got a phone call from his work because i was still his emergency contact asking me if i knew where he was because he hasnt turned up. the police got in touch too. the last phone call that day was from his mum, to let me know that hed killed himself.	4218	20447	bqhfq9	eo58lqs
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	ive been active in numerous online communities over the years, and have been fortunate enough to hang out with many of the friends ive made there in person. theres only been one incident i couldnt cope with. he picked me up at the airport, which was very nice of him, and as soon as we got into the car, he started picking his nose. theres a lot that goes through your mind when you hop into a vehicle with someone youve never been alone with and you immediately catch them two knuckles deep in their rostrum. i looked quickly away so that he wouldnt know i caught him and be embarrassed, if he was just trying to sneak one out before i noticed. if he did notice, he didnt seem embarrassed, so i relaxed a little. i guessed maybe he was just so confident about himself and our friendship that hed ascended past caring if i saw him take care of a quick boog. fine, sure. when i finally looked back at him, he was wiping his fingers across his dashboard. to this day im not really sure what to think, but this guy spent the entirety of the few hours we were together scooping out boogers and wiping them off on parts of his car or the table or wherever it was that wed stopped at. i realized i was being transported in a rolling booger shrine and that there was nothing i could touch without needing to wash my hands. i was sitting on a crust of fossilized booger stuff. i had to be. i didnt want to hurt his feelings, he was a nice dude, but i wound up ollying out of our visit early because i couldnt handle it. i dont consider myself a clean freak, but as wiping started to stack it was all i could do not to throw open the passenger door and roll myself out into traffic to escape. i still wonder if i should have done or said anything to save him some grief in the future but it didnt feel like it was my place, you know? what do you even say?	4371	20447	bqhfq9	eo5cbn1
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"\*flashback 15 years ago\* i was talking to a person online i'd known for a few years. we weren't best friends, but we talked daily. seemed like a nice guy. at some point he he asked where i was from, and i mentioned that i lived in philly and i was going to the art institute there, living in the dorms. didn't give specifics other than that. most people knew i was an art student at the time (i posted it about regularly on livejournal). a few days later i come home from class and see a message on aim. ""figured out where you live. i'm outside of the dorms at the cafe across the street. meet me."" this guy lived on the west coast, and after finding out where i lived, he makes an unannounced trip across the country, tracked down the building where i lived in, and was camped out at the cafe across the street. asking him to meet him. all of this *without any head's up.* i immediately felt uncomfortable, and didn't really know what to do. it's one thing to meet up, another thing entirely to make a trip cross country and camp out in front of a person's residence. i didn't answer the aim message right away and needed some time to calm down and think, get more rational. more messages started coming through, each reading slightly more hostile than the last. okay, this guy traveled all this way. it'd be a dick move to ignore him, but at the same time, i felt like i was seeing red flags everywhere. i was legitimately creeped out. more messages came, and each time, they started to get more agitated, more impatient. he started asking for my class schedule so he could meet me outside class, asking where i'd be going, where i usually ate, what time my dinner schedule was. he started getting weirdly specific about wanting to know about every facet of my life. i was getting full-on stalker vibes. so i lied, and told him that i was visiting my sister and that i'd be back over the weekend, and *i'd just miss him.* that's when he said ""that's fine. i can wait."" and he did. three days later, he's still there, still messaging me that he's ""still at the cafe. waiting."" *what the fuck are you waiting for? why are you here? why didn't you tell me you were coming?* my privacy was having huge issues with all of this, and it got to the point i started feeling legitimately scared. i made a decision. rather than meet him, i'd log out out aim, create a new handle, pretend i never existed at that point. i completely abandoned my livejournal and started posting under a new name, and went so far as to change my entire online persona. i never heard from him again."	1635	20447	bqhfq9	eo5lwyt

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"not a horror story, but definitely weird. at 13 years old, i went to a show where my male online friend was also supposed to go. not a big show and i was with my father, don't worry. we were supposed to meet at one of the entrances, but he never showed up. when i asked him about it later, he said he must have been at the wrong entrance. over time we stopped talking for no reason really. a few years later, one of our mutual online friend told me she learned that the guy in question was actually a girl. i don't care about the gender, the thing is that she wasn't the one on any of the pictures she sent to us and our other friends, and her name wasn't her real name, she totally invented another identity. the worst part is that another of our friend even told us she got pregnant from ""him"". i don't know if she asked her to fake a pregnancy, or if it was her own idea, but that was really weird. wonder what other thing she lied to us about."	6094	20447	bqhfq9	eo4r1se
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i used to play a war game and i was friends with this other person (was a guy) and we became good friends and talked and all then out of the blue he asked me to be his girlfriend (he was a truck driver in the usa and i was only 12) it freaked me out a lot and i ghosted him. it was a terrifying experience and a real eye opener for me.	2061	20447	bqhfq9	eo55m9h
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i used to play wow with my now ex. our guild leader actually wound up moving to our state with his wife. my ex and i broke up before we got the chance to hang out with the guy, and right after the break up he messaged my ex essentially asking if it was cool if he and his wife got me drunk and took advantage of me. ex showed me screenshots when i was getting my stuff from his place and i cancelled my plans to meet the guy and his wife. my ex had been physically abusive and broke up with me to date the girl he'd cheated on me with. i'd tried leaving before but he'd fake suicide attempts and i was so scared he'd go through with it so i stayed. even though he was in a new relationship he tried to keep tabs on me and control me, but i saw it as my chance to escape. i happened to move right after we split and he didn't know my new address. i blocked him on everything. somehow he kept getting information on me though. turns out the guild leader was feeding him everything, i hadn't deleted the guy off facebook cause i figured he was only a problem in person. when i confronted him over messenger, bringing up the abuse, and the guy said, ""he said he choked you because you guys were arguing and he was afraid he wouldn't get the chance to speak. he still loves you."" side note, the choking was cause i was defending myself against accusations of cheating, which i hadn't done."	5008	20447	bqhfq9	eo4rvuq
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i dont know if its a horror story, but it how i ended up where i live now. i played wow for years with a pretty regular group, got to know them offline and at one point two of them, a couple, invited me to move across the country. at the time i didnt have anything tying me to where i was, so i packed up and moved. got out here, moved in with my friends and everything seemed okay. my buddy was a long haul driver so he was always gone for days at a time. his girl would try to set me up multiple times with two of her friends at the same time (one in minnesota). i ended up having a hard time finding work for a while, finally got a job though and was putting some money away while helping watch their kids. out of nowhere one day my buddy accuses me of trying to fool around with his girl. nothing had ever happened, but i had noticed her spending more and more time in my room when he wasnt there. i knew his history and his previous relationship had ended after she cheated with a friend of his. he wouldnt listen, so i got kicked out without any warning and they stole about $1k worth of my stuff and later moved. ultimately it all worked out for me. cut the friend and his girl out of my life completely and moved on. now i have a good job here, wife and kids. *edit* clarified that i cut out the friend and the girl lol not my wife and kids	7488	20447	bqhfq9	eo4j9cr
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	we were friends online for years. wed meet up every so often and when we started families wed meet up and take the kids to the zoos or whatever. she wanted us to go on a cruise together, with our husbands and kids. i made the comment towards the effect of we cant afford that, and she went nuts. we shouldnt have had kids if we cant afford them, we shouldnt have more children, our life sucks blah blah blah because i didnt want to go on a goddamn cruise with her and her bratty ass kid. sounds like a nightmare.	7322	20447	bqhfq9	eo4u09p
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i was the horror in this story. i was part of an online writing community that i really enjoyed and i made a lot of good friends through the years. one man and his wife were visiting from another country so another guy from my area and i were going to take them to dinner and have a nice in-person evening with sight-seeing and conversation. things kind of blew up for me at that time. my (now ex) husband and i were having major issues and i was near my mental and emotional breaking point. i had lost 15 lbs in three weeks just from pure stress. on top of that, my family had chosen that evening to have a get together for my uncle who would soon be travelling to undergo surgery for cancer. i showed up in body, but that was basically it. my mind was a million miles away. i wasnt talkative at all, and i left after about an hour. i feel like i lost three good friends that evening because of my behaviour at dinner and my subsequent withdrawal from the whole community. im sure they look back on that evening and think what a nightmare host i was. *edited to add several missing ts	475	20447	bqhfq9	eo5dv3h
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i was on meetme, met this guy who was super cool. we ended up texting every single day and i took the train out to los angeles to meet him. when i got there, he was being kinda shitty and he told me that he hadn't gotten much sleep becuz he was partying until 5am. we walked to his house and when i walked into his room, i was kind of shocked. it was a 8x6.5 room. all he had was a mat on the floor and a small little jewelry box full of mementos on top of his suitcase of clothes. we took a nap together. later, we went to get ramen and he asked me to pay. i didn't mind. we went back to his place and we listened to music while we waited to go to a party. fast forward to that night.we met up with some of his friends and they were so mean to him. they kept roasting him and picking on him and he was visibly getting upset. i stopped him for a bit so his friends could walk ahead of us. i reminded him that it was all fun nd games and to ignore them. ended up at the party and lots of people knew him. i sat out in the patio with a few cool people that i had just met while i waited for my friend to come back from saying hello to everyone inside.he never did. i was outside in the patio with these strangers for about 3 hours. people kept coming up to me and asking if i was alright. idk if i looked sad or if i just looked like a plain loner. i went to find him and it was so packed. didn't see him so i walked back. i seen his roommate and asked him to please tell my friend that i was gonna go get a motel. he went to tell him, came back and said my friend was being a dick & he would walk me back to the house instead so i didn't have to spend money on a hotel. we got to the house and i thanked him for walking all the way back home. i really appreciated it as my friend was probz inside doing coke or fucking girls. i went to bed in my friends room and he woke me up in the middle of the night kissing me, trying to get his freak on. i simply said no. i'm not interested in having sex. his exact words were, ""are you serious? what was the point of you coming here?? you're such a waste of time!"" my feelings were really hurt. i went back to sleep, woke up and left. never wrote him after that. he had texted me a month later asking to borrow $50. i simply ignored the message and moved on."	1824	20447	bqhfq9	eo56klc
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	sorry in advance, this is a long one. i was talking to this girl i met on quizilla back in 2008/9. we met because she made one of thosewhich twilight characters are you? quizzes, and i was asking for help on making mine. we got to talking and realized that we were roughly the same age, lived in the same state only a couple hours apart, and had quite a few things in common. fast forward a few months, i start thinking of her as one of my genuine best friends, and we start to broach the subject of meeting irl. my parents- understandably- have their doubts, and only agree to let me meet her if i agree to bring my older brother along. (i was 13, he was 18). i agree, and the girl and i arrange to meet at a museum that is equidistant from both of us. so the day comes, and its time for me to finally meet this girl ive been talking to for a solid 6-7 months. my brother agrees that hes not going to breathe down my neck, but that ill always be within eyeshot. i see her at the entrance when i walk up, and everything seems to be going well! after all, shes not an 80 year old man, and she looks exactly like her pictures, which is really all that i could possibly expect from the situation. later on in the day, my brother meets up with us so that he could drive us somewhere to get lunch, and everything immediately went downhill from there. this was the first time my brother had really seen her up close, and not from a few meters away, and he gets a really confused look on his face. he doesnt react further, but stays pretty much quiet the rest of the drive. i think nothing of it, and just assume that hes letting us talk and doesnt want to interrupt. when we get to the restaurant, she doesnt want to sit on my side of the booth with me, instead choosing to sit next to my brother. she claims that this is because she wants to be able to look at me while shes talking, but my brother is looking more and more uncomfortable with the situation. i decide to sit next to him instead, and dont really give her an option. suddenly, the conversation starts to drift from me and her, to just about my brother. what he does for school, where he works, his friends, etc. i start getting really jealous, and eventually blow up saying are you here to talk to me, or to just my brother??? she starts backpedaling, and apologizes for ignoring me. at that moment, my brother finally realizes that he recognizes her as a girl that had been stalking him on myspace for the past few months, but without all of the terrible filters/makeup/angles that he was use to seeing her with. he immediately gets super freaked out, and starts saying that we need to leave, and that she needs to find her own way home. we end up leaving as soon as her parents come to pick her up, and i never hear from her again. and thats the story of how my junior high online best friend was also my brothers weird myspace stalker. needless to say, he still brings it up to this day, and uses it against me at every opportunity.	314	20447	bqhfq9	eo631x9
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i (25) was best friends with a woman (46) for nearly six years. we would talk for hours and send each other gifts constantly. we shared everything from art to personal trauma. we were very close. when i fell in hard times, she was very kind and offered to take me in. i was so grateful that she would do this for me. after a few months, things started to change. i started to see why she was such a lonely person. she was mean, if not cruel, to anyone who ever disagreed with her or even had a different opinion. she was so mentally unstable that she couldn't even buy something without having to call her elderly mother and ask for permission. i found out that she was scamming the disability services to get money from the government because she didn't want her mother tracking her spending. she was so horrible to her caregiver. i'll admit that the guy was a complete moron, but he was still a sweet guy that was just trying to help. she was so abusive towards him that i had to step in on multiple occasions, which she fucking hated because it meant i wasn't on her side. that's when she turned on me. she began to freak out over small stuff. screaming and crying because i missed a spot while mopping or because i spilled a little bit if water in the kitchen or ate my food too fast. she was fucking insane! as soon as i realized how messed up and unstable she was (after being screamed at and chased back to my room) i told her that i was going to be moving out as soon as possible. so, for the next week, she decided to make my life a living hell. she would scream about me to other people on the phone, telling lies about me, saying i did things i never did. and because she was a youtuber with a big following, she doxed me on social media, telling people i punched holes in her walls and keyed her car. she even called the cops and tried to get me arrested for things i didn't do. her followers began to harass me, sending me rape/death threats. then she started posting and sharing all of my personal secrets that i had shared with her in confidence. i ended up having to call my family to come get me because she was wanting to keep my dog so that i would have to keep in contact with her and i was no longer feeling save. so, after six months of living in hell and three years of internet harassment and stalking that followed, i'll never meet someone i met online ever again. i have no interest in online friends. it's not safe because you never know how absolutely fucked up someone is until it's too late	796	20447	bqhfq9	eo5dhwv

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	back in about 1998, i met someone playing an online word game. we were both 16 year old girls and we just hit it off and became very close. finally in 2004 she was passing though where i lived so i invited her to stay for a few days. she shows up totally coked up. then she invites some guy over and they were snorting cocaine off her car key in my living room. i didn't know she used coke and i was so uncomfortable the entire time. it was like having a stranger there, yet we knew everything about each other. we remained in touch and i still really like her but it was just such an awkward visit. we haven't seen each other since, though. edit: fixed a typo	538	20447	bqhfq9	eo50wzo

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"oh finally i have somewhere to tell this story, but it's probably too late to get any real traction. long story short, when i was doing a lot of online dating i had multiple accounts across multiple platforms. one happened to be fetlife. i used pictures there that i hadn't put online before, with my face cropped out. it didnt pan out however, i didn't really like any of the guys that messaged me, i was polite to them all but ultimately kind of abandoned my profile. cue tinder, i match with a guy that looks white collar, tailored, professional. just my type. we match, talk for a week or so until we decide to get drinks. i get to the bar (took an uber there) and look around. dont see him. until this scraggly looking guy comes up to me and says ""oh hey grenadinegarden! i thought youd never make it!"" now, i'm not unusually one to judge by appearances, we all have rough days and lord knows i dont wear makeup or do my hair on the busiest of them, but his hair was significantly longer (think short, well manicured hair versus mid back length uncombed waves), he was covered in a patchy beard, and dressed really badly. i honestly didnt recognize him, and he waved it off with ""sorry. those pictures are kind of old"". red flag stupidly ignored, we grab a small table with huge chair and start drinking and talking. one drink, just to be polite, but i'm turned off at this point wholly. then, the kicker. he leans in toward me, puts his hand on my thigh, and says, ""you know, after you didnt message me back on fetlife, i'm surprised we matched on tinder. you really are quite beautiful."" at this point i'm like ""?!?!?!?! i'm sorry????"" he chuckles, literally chuckles like a villain in a movie, pats my thigh, and says ""i'm going to the bathroom. you should look at your profile and figure it out. i found you because your body is quite distinct."" it's worth noting we live in a major international tourist city. there are thousands upon thousands of new people here every day. especially on tinder. this is not a small town. i used to match with people that would swipe between connecting flights! so i'm beyond nervous, watch him get up and go, and i quickly check my fetlife inbox and lo and behold, he had messaged me months ago. his profile picture looked like an absolute serial killer. i remember why i rejected him. incompatible on all fronts. and i was polite. so anyways, i got to use the whole ""angel shot"" protocol. in which i basically ran to the bartender, explained the situation, and left through the back door. i was beyond uncomfortable. and deleted all of my social media for a few months. and i consider myself lucky that he only sent a few ""you're a whore etcetc"" messages for the rest of the evening but gave up after that. and i paid for my own drink, too. i'm not a monster."	411	20447	bqhfq9	eo63ofq
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"it's not a horror story, it's a story about how i was put off meeting people from the internet i was friends with a bunch of people i met through an online game. after about 2 years, i decided to meet 2 of them. the 2 i was meeting were a long distance couple, one from one country and the other from mine. they had met many times and had spent 2 weeks together prior to meeting with me. we met in the city, said hi and hugged and did some touristy stuff, took their pictures etc etc. but throughout the whole time, they weren't really talking to me. at first, i put it down to anxiety as i was nervous too. but even after lunch, they were only talking to each other and i felt left out. i even took a sneaky video of them talking to each other and sent it a friend, who agreed it was odd. when it was time for me to leave, i told them i had to go but i had a nice time, and they continued to chat to each other. i said it again but no response, so i started to walk away, until one of them said ""oh byeee"" i was really hurt. it was like they didn't want me to be with them. i had spent a lot of money getting down, especially since at the time i didn't have a job. when i got back, i stopped talking to them. the friend who i sent the video to sent a message to them asking why they were ignoring me, and they tried to turn it on me saying that i was the quiet one and that i was being rude to them, especially ""leaving without saying goodbye"". i blocked them all on the game. a few months go bye and one of them finds my social media and tries to reconnect. starts off well, and then goes back to blaming me. haven't met anyone from the internet since"	2230	20447	bqhfq9	eo4uap0

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i'd been chatting to a girl for quite some time and finally ended up visiting her house about 50 miles away for an evening of enjoying each others company. we wake up the next morning to loud noises, which turned out to be her fiance i knew nothing about, ripping a window off it's hinges and climbing in as she'd locked him out (locked the door and left the key in the lock) and there was a strange car on the driveway, so he thought she might be in trouble. alas, it was me in trouble as this guy was huge, and a bit upset by this point. i managed to talk him down and explained the situation, to then find she had called the police and accused him of breaking and entering. during the time the police were questioning him, i made my escape and high-tailed it out of there.	125	20447	bqhfq9	eo5swfz
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i never actually met him but i used to play runescape when i was younger (around 11ish). i didnt pay for the member account so there were a bunch of items and things i couldnt get. some member started gifting me things and i was super grateful. every time i went on he would help me with my quests and whatever. but over time he started asking more personal questions like what i looked like, what i liked to do etc. etc. in return he told me his first name, that he was 14 and that he was in the army as some cadet programme or something but back visiting family blah blah. i knew nothing about the army, a cadet programme at that age didnt sound that far fetched to little ol me. he started to escalate how he was talking to me and started sending me messages like hi sexy, miss you come back and talk to me babe. etc. i stopped replying because i was creeped out and was 11. i still thought boys were gross. anyway in school the next day i was making small talk with a girl i sat next to and she mentioned how her brother was home and how much shed missed him while hed been away in the army. i got a sinking feeling then which continued when she told me his name (a match). in desperation i asked her if he ever played runescape in which she said he did and his username was friendsusername she showed me a picture and told me about how she was really excited about how hed finally found his calling in the army. dude was 26. yikes	449	20447	bqhfq9	eo5uph7
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i have two. one was this guy from an mmo i played. he was older than me, married, had a kid, stuck up for me a lot. everyone said not to trust him, but i thought i knew him better than that. he told me he thought i was really smart, and he wanted to make a journal with me. because a journal needs a lot of content, though, he asked me to write extra stuff to save for future publications. i had nothing going on so i said i'd do it, even though his prompts were super specific and kind of boring. one day, though, he called me and asked me to go into his email because he didn't get online and he needed something. i saw a folder with my name on it, so i clicked it. it was filled with emails to other people, with my writing attached, and negotiations for payment. he was selling my writing to college kids for $500 - $1000 each. the second guy, i met from the same game. he was in a bad place and i felt sorry for him. i offered to let him join me and my new roommate in our apartment search. the rent was going to be super cheap. he was really messy, though (filthy, even) and i told him that since the landlord was really strict, he'd have to make sure to keep things somewhat clean. he went to my roommate behind my back, said i was too controlling, and offered to replace me with his way cooler friend (who would pay more, of course). i just considered this a bullet dodged and moved on. i got an even better, somehow cheaper apartment. when he saw the photos online, he freaked out, started stalking my mom (sending me notes on where she was throughout the day), and when i called the cops on him, he called in a bomb threat to my work. i lost my job and my apartment. don't worry, i'm not dumb anymore.	932	20447	bqhfq9	eo52mc3
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this is /u/kikistiel 's story, but it popped into my head because she wins all horror stories imo with this. [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/sadcringe/comments/9b9pk6/the_dirtiest_job/e51q307/?context=3) copy/paste text: this almost was me. almost. long story time: i am an artist, and my main job before the one i have now was selling my work at comic, anime, and video game cons across the us and canada, and sometimes in more countries. it was surprisingly a lucrative job if you did it right and i enjoyed it, and required a lot more work than people realized. but i digress, the point is i was familiar with the convention scene and this leads me to my next point: i used to take commissions at conventions but i stopped doing them years ago because i got too busy and my art had improved enough that $100 felt too low for my skill level, and im all about artists pricing their work fairly and not working for pennies. a couple of years ago, just as i had started phasing out commission work, a man had approached me at a con. you get a lot of socially awkward people at cons, to be expected, but 99.5% of them are really sweet and just like to talk about stuff the dig. if you have a good amount of patience, its enjoyable. but this guy. he immediately asked me if i did commissions. i said no, unfortunately not anymore.he asked me how much my prices were, and usually when people ask i just. quote some arbitrary high number just to get them to throw out the idea without outright telling them no. and if they want to pay it, well. then we can talk. i said $350. he said, cool, done. in cash? i was stammering at him, not expecting him to go for it. eventually i just asked him what he wanted. to make a long story shorter, he wanted furry art. soft core porn to be exact. i had never in my life done furry art, but i knew how lucrative it seemed to be. i said oh, each character would be extra. nsfw would be extra too. this would be a big commission. hes like oh no worries. how much extra? this went back and forth for a while and to save time, he paid me $700, in cash, on the spot, for some furry porn. i wasnt even mad, $700 is nice, so i said sure ill draw the furry porn. what do i care? ill fake sign it, its one and done. after i did it in one night in my hotel room, i found he had taken my business card and had given my email to his friends who may be interested in commissioning art. the requests for weirder and weirder, but the pay stayed surprisingly good. eventually, i ended up making a furaffinity account under a fake name and tweaked my style and techniques enough that no one could ever trace the art back to me. i decided to just fully embrace the furry art bank life. it was open season  i guarantee you i was a no-name in that community and still made good money, so im horrified to think what the really popular artists get. i didnt feel ashamed for drawing weird furry fetish porn, nor did i feel bad for kinda being a fraud. i provided a service, and that was it. things went downhill when i mistakenly befriended someone in the community. she was another furry artist, and we just sort of hit it off in the online community. she seemed like an edgy self-hating furry so our jabbing humor at the expense of furries made us bond. she was cool, all was well. eventually i admitted to her that i didnt actually give a shit about furries, and she took it in stride. said she understood why i used the community to make money because she wished she wasnt a fucking furry either, but you cant help what you like. she told me that if i really wanted to make bank, i should go to a furry convention. i was immediately like fuck no. never in my life, but she told me about an anime con that i regularly attended that next year would be sharing the same venue and weekend as a furry convention. just table hop, she said. she told me to split her table with her, try it out, see how i fared. i already had a table at the anime con, so i was like sure, why the hell not? what could it hurt? we decided to even share a hotel room. this isnt uncommon. in artist alleys many artists room share together since we have similar schedules and dont tend to party hard because we are working. she seemed like a good person and its not uncommon to just meet someone irl when youre rooming with them. i arrived thursday before the con, but the furry con had already started. i got a text from my friend to come sit at her table in the furry con dealers den for a few hours since my con didnt start until friday, just to see if it clicked. she had already checked in to the hotel room and had the keys anyways, so i picked up my badge and went. i was. surprised to find her at the table. in full fursuit. they was the weird part. she was a self hating furry, or so she claimed, so to go full commitment and be in a suit was. ok. hmm. i was already out of my comfort zone in the sea of furries, and my friend was supposed to be like my anchor, my guide through this other world to protect me from this shit. i was immediately on edge. it got worse when i sat down and introduced myself and she did that. thing. that thing that furries do where they are in fur suits and dont talk. she nodded when i made sure she was who i thought she was, but she just did the overly exaggerated cute poses and even had a fucking squeaky toy in her fursuit to make noise. but she didnt say a word. she hugged me, and somehow??? managed to interact with customers who all knew her and adored her (i guess she was well know in the community) and if she wanted to communicate, would write. or text in this big ass oaw things. she said she hates wearing suits but because she doesnt have to talk in them, she doesnt have to interact much with customers. okay. that i could kind maybe believe. sort of. at around 7 pm we packed up to leave to go to the hotel room. she stayed in suit the whole way up. in the room i flopped down on my bed exhausted. i asked her if she was going to come out of that thing, understandably a little freaked out. from this whole thing. then she did the thing that made me want to run out of the room, which i didnt against my better judgment. i had flopped on the bed with the upper half of my body, my feet still on the floor, my shirt had ridden up my torso. she stepped in between my legs and fucking tickled me on my exposed belly. i flipped the fuck out, as one does when sneak attacked by tickles and wriggled out of her reach. she made that laughing pose that furries do where they hold their paws to their mouths bashfully but still silent as fuck. i was so creeped out. my go to way of handling stress like that is laughing it off nervously. she got the hint and motioned she was going to get a shower. as soon as she was in the shower i decided i didnt want to be there when she got out, for now. but instead of lugging all my stuff i decided i would come back for it, preferably with friends. but i needed a key, so i went to her wallet she had taken out of one of her suit pockets, and tried to find the keys i had seen her slip in to her wallet. and of course as soon as i opened it i just had to see her id. i just had to, i was too curious not too. and when i opened it i looked at the id slot and i flipped. my. shit. whoever was in that id was not in any way who i was expecting to see on that picture. i didnt know the super personal details of my friend besides her name and age and general descriptive factors. mid 20s, white girl, etc. that was not who was on this id. it was a man, with long greasy hair, glasses, and stubble, in his mid 40 or early 50s id wager. i was so fucking shocked that i literally threw the wallet across the room after grabbing a key and ran the fuck out of that hotel room. i took fifteen flights of stairs down to the lobby and called up a friend who was coming to the con freaking out. i never saw the real person under the suit. my friend, a tall burly scary looking dude, went up for my stuff later that night with the key id grabbed. when he came back with all my things, he said there was no one in the room. i stayed with him in his room that weekend, and kept only to the convention my friend didnt have a badge to get in to unless i was with a group outside of it. the next night i deleted my furaffinity account, blocked my friend on my chat app, and deleted every connection i had to the furry world. the money be damned. i would never venture in to that mess again. to this day, that event still makes me sweat man. i have some really awful, funny, and silly con stories from my time as a traveling con artist, and this and one other incident top the list as the worst(tm). i have still not recovered. and that was how i almost became like the op in the image, but got out just in time (i hope) before anything terrible happened. tl;dr: i got catfished(??) by a furry and probably almost became a victim of some sort. all over furry art and my greed for that good good furry money. its not worth it. dont do it friends. i dont want to mention con names and stuff but if you googled furry and anime con happens at same hotel im sure you can find the magical con this happened at.	94	20447	bqhfq9	eo6evp6

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"this happened when dial up was at its prime. i was young, self destructive and couldn't care less. i just wanted to meet new people and have fun. i joined a chatroom and ended up finding someone who lived in my smallish town. we chatted for six months before agreeing to meet up. he was very aware that i was 14 at the time we started chatting, and i knew he was 30 something. at the time i thought he cared like a brother or a dad figure. i didn't know he was grooming me. it was just nice to be able to talk to someone who seemed like they cared about me. we decided to meet up for coffee for one day. we agreed to meet up at night a couple days days later. the whole time leading up to it he was saying he was nervous and scared. i couldn't figure out why he would be scared or nervous. he picks me up a block away from house. first red flag i actually noticed. i get into the car and realize he is one of my brothers high school teachers. i had met this guy before at a open house and he was really nice. so, i put the red flags on pause. we kind of laughed that we had met before and didn't realize it. as we are talking he passed by the coffee place. he says i have a better place in mind. he drove us 15 miles outside of town in a country like area and pulled over. this area of town was rarely ever populated by moving traffic. we were alone and there was no way out. at this point i knew what was going to happen. i thought to myself ""great, now i'm an after school special"". he said that my top was really sexy and started to touch my breast. he began to kiss me and held my hands down with force. you guys can imagine what happened after that. he was kind about it (as kind as this situation could be) until i got up the courage to say no. then he turned into a monster. i thought he would leave me for dead on the side of the road. after it was over a wave of remorse hit him. he apologized for getting so rough. he begged me not to ruin his life. i promised that i would never say a word to anyone and that i wanted it. he said he needed to hear me say i wanted it. it was pure survival mode at that point. i would have said anything to get out of there alive. once he felt reassured i wouldn't tell. he helped clean me up (i was a bloody mess) and dropped me off a block away from home. so, that's my horror story. don't trust people you meet off the internet."	83	20447	bqhfq9	eo5xbbu
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	didnt happen to me but a good friend of mine when i was living in oregon around few years ago, he had an older sister who met some random guy from the east coast online and were constantly chatting. after some time they developed feelings for each other and he decides to move cross country in order to marry her, the issue was she was 26, didnt have a job and was still living in her parents house. he was incredibly lazy, a slob, never graduated high school and also couldnt keep a job to save his own life, but since she is lonely & insecure she accepts and continue living in their parents house to this day.	375	20447	bqhfq9	eo54jjp

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i met a guy through [match.com](https://match.com). after countless exchanges, we went on a date. he showed up handsome, well dressed and successful. we went to a beautiful french restaurant. during dinner he claimed to feel bad and asked if we could not talk then proceeded to ask for the check right after the entrees arrived. i asked for the waiter to box my meal. when we got into his car he said let's go my my house; have coffee and listen to music. i said, no thank you and please take me home. he drove in the opposite direction. after a five minute argument, we went to starbucks for coffee and he yelled at me because he couldn't smoke in the cafe. just then a friend texted and invited me to her party a few miles away. i figured this was my out, i asked him to go with me. we were there for about an hour and he said he was ready to leave.i told him i was staying. he said, ""you're not leaving with me?"" i told him no. he then slapped me across the face in a room full of my friends and no one saw it. i was shocked. he leaned in an inch from my face and said, ""what's wrong, cat got your tongue?"" he turned around and walked out. he then continued to leave me harassing messages calling me names and stalked me for the next three months. he'd show up at places he knew i would be. he would call me from other numbers and cry and ask me to go to counseling with him. he finally stopped. it ruined online dating for me forever."	383	20447	bqhfq9	eo5tee0
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i was 17-18, dude (25 or so) was a friend i'd known though a group on yahoo chatrooms for probably 4 or 5 years by that point. he and his long-term on/off girlfriend had broken up around the same time i broke up with an online boyfriend for cheating on me, so we had been sharing our sorrows. totally platonic, nothing romantic was ever mentioned. he actually knew about my mom's mental health condition too and that i was uncomfortable around people with the same issue because she was super abusive to me and the mannerisms are a ptsd trigger for me (this is relevant). one day he says ""i'm coming up to [your city] for the weekend so we can hang out."" i felt pretty blindsided because he hadn't said anything ahead of time, let alone asked me about it, and had no reason to come to my state even, which was a good 2 day bus trip, but i was too polite to tell him no. i picked him up from the bus station and dropped him at his hotel and then had to go to work (thankfully). i knew from that car ride that i didn't want to be around him in person because it was pretty instantly clear to me he had the same mental health condition my mom had. that alone made me super uncomfortable, but we also had nothing to talk about in person, and it was pretty clear he had come up with romantic intentions. i saw him for about 2 hours the next day and then lied and said i had work again. he suggested i could stay the night in his hotel; i declined. he got back to the bus station on his own. after a week or so of silence, he actually apologized for his behavior (which i appreciated), but we never quite got back on the right foot. looking back, i know it could've been much worse, but at the time it felt terrifying and dangerous."	127	20447	bqhfq9	eo5p8xq
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	when i was about 30 and living in nyc a girl on okcupid started messaging me. she said she was 21, a student at nyu, and was into anime and all sorts of other wonderful nerdiness (i should mention i am part asian so online dating would get all the weeaboos). but what was strange was her pictures. looked like a model. it seemed like there was no way this redheaded model contacted me out of the blue. we started texting. shed text me all the time. and started sending pictures. of her cat, her shoes, her fingernails. never a full shot of her. and then she started calling me. we would actuslly have great conversations and she seemed like some parts of her stories were true. she shared an apartment with other girls and she would interact with them (and i would hear them talk bsck) during our conversations. however the pictures of the redhead she sent me. in the photo properties were pictures several years old (so definitely not her). i even had a female friend point out her fingernails were rounded but the redheads were squared as evidence. anyway i pushed to meet her and she disappeared. the strangest part of the story was i would talk about this mystery, sometimes on other dates. and one of them had previously dated a writer (an asian guy) and shared with me a short story he wrote about his experience with the same girl. that a redhead contacted him, started texting, calling, etc then disappeared forever.	130	20447	bqhfq9	eo5u5x8
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	this was about 16 years ago. i (26f)was talking to a guy online and we were calling each other back and forth. he lived in nj and i lived in mass. we finally decided to meet so he drove up here from new jersey. my friend was working at a laundromat at the time so i decided it was safe place for us to meet there. after hours of waiting, he pulled into the parking lot in an old beat up car with all his belongings in the back seat and he looked about 50 years old. he was pretty scary and i was pretty freaked out. i guess he thought he was moving in which was no way happening as i had a roommate. what he told me on the phone he was a few years older than me and i never saw a picture. i guess i was very trusting because everything he told me, i believed. good thing i decided to meet him last minute in a public place. i had to tell him that i was not interested and he needed to leave that night. that was such a bad situation.	323	20447	bqhfq9	eo5b0fu
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	a couple of years ago this girl messaged me on reddit saying she really connected with a comment i made about first seeing the ocean because she had just gone through a similar experience. she was going to come down to chicago to visit a friend of hers and asked for suggestions of things to do. i gave her a bunch and then we kept talking and finding out we had more and more in common. we eventually started talking over the phone and text messages and when she came down we went out for burgers and beer. we kept talking every day after that and i was really starting to like her. she said she wanted to come down to chicago again and if she could stay with me. i told her of course and a few weeks later she was here for saturday and sunday. really it was mostly sunday because she got in late on saturday and fell asleep on my couch. the next day we went to the zoo and had a really amazing day. after that we came back to my place and decided to go to the brewery nearby which made a beer that had her name in it. we went there and then ended up barhopping through until we ended up near the dive bar by my apartment. we drank and played pool there and eventually grabbed some to-go beers and headed back. i asked if she wanted to see the place by the river i liked to go and drink and think. we sat and eventually started making out and decided to head back to my apartment. we hooked up and then the next day went to the south side to get breakfast at a place she really liked near her friend's apartment before she had to drive back. we kept talking after that and i was planning on coming up to visit her in detroit, but then one day she just ghosted me out of no where. not as horrible as some other stories, but it was really shitty for me because i actually really liked this girl and to this day i have no idea why she stopped talking to me. edit: she's definitely not dead, we followed each other on instagram and i saw that she was okay a bit after she ghosted me. edit 2: went digging and was actually able to find [the message thread](https://i.imgur.com/ipjp7xi.png) for those of you that don't believe me.	2688	20447	bqhfq9	eo4ocuc

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	oh! okay, when i was 14, i applied for jobs around my local area online. most places didn't get back to me because i was a child. except for one man who ran a printing shop who wanted to talk to me on msn . i was eager for the job so i began chatting to him. he was late 50s and seemed friendly. after a week or so of talking, he wanted to interview me in person. i jumped at the chance. the day of the interview, i dressed painstakingly neat and smart . he led me around the back of the shop and upstairs to a small room. i already had major misgivings at this point but was too afraid to back out. he locked us both in that room together and turned a camera on to face me. i don't remember much of what was said, but he forced himself onto me and then came all over my smart clothes. i was in shock and really shut down, but i remember the bizarre thought of how he'd ruined my clothes. so yeah, there's a vile video of me out there as a teenager being abused by an old man and i never reported it because my mother beat the shit out of me for messing up my clothes.	307	20447	bqhfq9	eo5knts

"i met two livejournal friends, i'll call them adam and betty. adam came from the east coast, betty came from the west coast, they met in the middle and vacationed in my state so all of us could hang out. betty was fine. exactly the same irl as she was on livejournal. really pretty, too. adam, though. omfg. the first night we met up, we were going to karaoke. adam and betty would drive to my house, meet my mom, and pick twin and i up to go to the karaoke bar. betty doesn't drink, so she'd drive the rental car. they knocked. i opened the door. missy, my elderly terrier mutt who i love so much, immediately made friends with betty. betty walked all the way in, backing missy up, and then adam walked in. it was like a switch had flipped. miss dog *lost. her. shit.* she did the ""i am going to kill you"" bark--hackles raised, tail tucked between legs, snarling, snapping, and it sounded like she was screaming! mom asked me to help get the dog under control and in the back room, so i did. mom said she was worried about this guy adam, and wanted me to be careful. i said missy was obviously freaked out about him, too, so i wouldn't trust him as far as i could throw him. so, we went to the karaoke bar. betty ordered pop. this was a non-issue as she was a devout mormon and didn't drink. i ordered pop, and adam immediately started trying to talk me into alcohol because he knows i drink. hard nope, dude. being young and naive, i said ""maybe later"" rather than ""trying to pressure people to drink is a dick move and it makes people think you're a creep."" twin, who was still presenting female at the time, ordered pop. this surprised me, because he was going through a huge party phase; he spent most of his free time drunk. adam started trying to talk twin into alcohol, too. ""no, i have a headache, beer will make it worse."" we did karaoke, it was unremarkable, we went home. the next day, betty flew home. she just changed her ticket and bounced. she gave us the details in a filtered livejournal entry, saying that adam wouldn't stop hitting on her and she didn't feel comfortable being in the same hotel as him. we all blocked him."	1307	20447	bqhfq9	eo4v47w

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"warning: long post. tldr at the bottom. &#x200b; i owned a minecraft server in middle school, and my friend and i were playing when we met this girl who was around our age. she and i became really close friends because we were both extremely suicidal at the time and both needed someone to emotionally depend on. &#x200b; fast forward until my junior year of high school. she and i had corresponded over the years, albeit not consistently, and she was still the only human i could talk to about my depression. we start talking again, and after a few days, she says she loves me. i explain that i really like her as a friend, but i'm not interested in an online relationship. in response, she threatens to kill herself if i don't love her, so i cave and tell her i love her. &#x200b; it escalated from there. she would ask me to send nudes or masturbate with her over skype, neither of which i was comfortable with at all, but when i would tell her ""no"", she would threaten to kill herself again, say i didn't care for her, act extremely hurt, etc. so, being young and stupid, i started doing the things she asked (with the promise that she doesn't save anything), and i started having panic attacks every day. &#x200b; she started demanding more and more of my time, and i basically disappeared from real life until the end of the school year. still, nobody knew what was going on - i kept it all a secret out of embarrassment. she tells me to visit her or she'll kill herself (keep in mind we live a 15-hour drive apart). so, i tell my parents i want to visit colleges in her region, and they let me drive out there on my own. i spent around a week with her, and i finally realized the difference between real love and pressure/fear/dependency. &#x200b; at last, i drive home from my journey, and she gets even more crazy, demanding that i come to visit her again and that i introduce her to my real-life friends. my panic attacks and suicidal thoughts got even worse, and i eventually found my neck at the end of a rope in my closet. it was only then i realized how toxic the relationship was, and i decided to cut it off rather than end my life. &#x200b; a whole bunch of stuff went down when i broke up with her. it turned out she was saving my nudes the entire time, and she would send them to my friends and try to break into my accounts using my nudes as a ransom. i lost a bunch of friends because of it. i started drinking to cope with the panic attacks the ordeal had left me with (in addition to preexisting stuff), but fortunately, my more supportive friends saw a problem found me a therapist i could go to without telling my parents. for the most part, things slowly got better after that, and i haven't heard from her since. &#x200b; tldr; &#x200b; met a girl online who pressured me to masturbate with her over skype and visit her 15 hours away which caused me to have daily panic attacks. she then sent my nudes to my friends and tried to break into my online accounts."	488	20447	bqhfq9	eo5coyb

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	no where near as bad as the others on this post but, we used to have this skype group for certain people that liked a certain show about colourful horses, so we could talk about the show and art and make friends in general. somehow managed to find people that actually lived pretty locally to me so we arranged a day that we would meet up (me and 2 guys well call them johnny and joseph) i was about 18 at the time so figured i would be fine going without one of my other girl friends to stick to me. the initial meet up was great we talked and walked and just sort of enjoyed the time. eventually johnny went home because it was already getting late. so joseph and i walk around some more just chatting normally. we are walking really far away, i dont know the area but apparently he does so we just go. soon i need to pee so i ask joseph if he knows somewhere i can go use the bathroom. he tells me his house is nearby so we can drop by there. im kind of getting desperate at this point so i agree. it takes about five minutes to walk to his place. its in a pretty dodgy area so im pretty spooked already at this point. i go to the bathroom and he tells me he will be in the room 2 doors down. so when i finish up in the bathroom i go to find him. its his bedroom and hes on the computer. do you want to watch me play tf2? he says to me. i say ok as long as its not too long because its getting dark outside. i watch him play and my anxiety is just through the roof. he then puts on some horror game knowing full well because we discussed it earlier that i am terrified of horror games. so not only am i anxious but i am scared shitless and on the verge of tears. i ask again a bit more sternly (im a shy coward so speaking up like this is really out of character for me) can i go home now? no joke now dude turns around and asks do you wanna make out? at this point i am completely speechless and am frozen in place. dude has condoms on the bed just ready like as if he was expecting me to say yes before i even came to the room. of course i just say uh no and walk my way out of that situation. im so glad it didnt go further than that because like it really could have been worse. the walk home was really scary too, it was dark and after that i decided i was never going to meet people without someone else there again.	122	20447	bqhfq9	eo5ozp7
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not horror but as a 13/14 year old i used to meet boys off the internet all the time, alone, lying to my parents about where i was and going back to their houses. in retrospect im lucky i didnt get murdered and they were all who they said they were	157	20447	bqhfq9	eo5kw4p
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"not really a horror story, but i met this guy online when i was 11. he lived in egypt, i'm in canada. we talked for 10 years and met when i was 21. he skyped me on my birthday to tell me he was coming to see me. it was surreal. we spent 12 days together and we had so much fun: drinking, dancing, exploring, getting to know each other. well when it was time to leave he was under the impression that i would eventually move to egypt to be with him. it was hard telling him that was not my intention at all, and we no longer talk except for the occasional ""how are you"" or ""i miss you""."	42	20447	bqhfq9	eo5rhee
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"runescape, my sister and i made a friend. he was super chill and once my whole neighborhood got together and started playing we all came to know this guy and exchanged phone numbers. he called me a few times usually asking about quests specifically i remember him asking about silver light. he loved close by so he visited us a few times via bike, but we always hung out outside so our parents never really met him. well one of my neighborhood friend's parents found out and flipped the fuck out. this was during that whole ""every online friend is a predator phase."" they refused to believe that we were all the same age. these parents told everyone else's parents and everyone including me got grounded from the computer for months. my dad interrogated our online friend over the phone and threatened him, then concluded that he was in fact the same age as us and not a 40 year old man with a voice xhanger because his parents got into an argument with my dad. it was a total shitshow."	42	20447	bqhfq9	eo601cf
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"do i, ever. buckle up y'all, it's a long one. when i was 11, there was a game website that had chatrooms. you could play games with other people and chat alongside the game, etc. there weren't a lot of younger kids on the site, and i never usually talked to anyone. until i saw one day this kid (we'll call him a) said he was 12, so i started talking to him because i had never seen another kid play on the website at that point. we ended up becoming friends and began talking on aol im. my mom was super skeptical of the whole thing so we asked him to write my name on a piece of paper and then take a picture with it. my mom seemed satisfied after that and never questioned it again. our friendship was only ever platonic. we stayed friends for about three years and kept connected through the game website and myspace. when facebook came around, i stopped using myspace and lost track of him after that. cut to a few years later and i'm now in college. i was in a three hour long class and decided to bring my laptop with me, which i never ever did. during our fifteen minute break, i decided to check my twitter account, which was inactive and i hadn't used in years. i saw that there was a message from a from like two weeks before and instantly messaged him back, not believing it was him. but it was and we reconnected. he was dating this girl from his hometown but wasn't happy. i was single and away at school, ten hours from home while my mother was dying from an unknown illness at the time. a was there for me at any hour of the day/night and comforted me when things were bleak and not looking good for my mom. we made plans for new year's (i live in new york and he lived in kentucky) to go see the ball drop in the city and finally meet for the first time, but i was broke and december was really rough for my mom, so i cancelled. i quit school to take care of my mom and because i was so busy with her, we didn't talk as much. i started dating this guy and stopped talking to a altogether. it didn't last long and a messaged me after i had changed my relationship status back to single on facebook. he told me he also had broken up with his girlfriend and from that point on, we were ""talking"". we would be on the phone for hours, texting all day and night. we would download movies on our laptops and press play at the same time so we could watch it ""together"". he would call up starbucks at the mall i worked in and buy me a drink over the phone, then tell me to go pick it up. he connected with my mom on facebook to wish her well in her illness. he was in my opinion perfect. and i was falling hard. this went on for months. the week before my 20th birthday, my best friend told me we were going out to dinner with her boyfriend and a few of his friends that she wanted to try to hook me up with. she knew about a but didn't know it was ""serious"". i wasn't really interested but she kept bugging me and bugging me so i relented. we go to dinner and a walks in with my best friends boyfriend instead of his friends. my heart dropped into my stomach and started doing the cha cha slide. he had contacted my best friend weeks before and wanted to surprise me for my birthday. he stayed for a whole week. we went to the local aquarium, the beach (he had never seen the ocean before), got slurpees (they don't have 7-elevens where he's from) and went to dave and buster's, went paintballing. it was amazing. we kissed the night before he left and i was heart broken he was leaving. he told me he would be back. the next day, he messaged my dad (whom i live with) and told him that he wanted to be with me and wanted to know if my dad could help him move to new york so that he could do that. my dad, impressed at the speech and how i was treated the week a was there, told him he could live with us rent free if he helped my dad with his business (i live on a poultry farm). it was labor intensive but a was extremely adamant about moving to ny to be with me. so he did. a month later, he drove his little car from kentucky to ny with his dog and all his belongings. the first night he was there, he had run out to his car to get something. our phones, both iphones, were next to each other and one of them beeped. thinking it was mine, i picked it up and saw there was a text from e. e was his exgirlfriend. the text said ""i miss my whalenugget"". i was super confused and slightly disgusted (whalenugget???) but he had just driven 9 hours, hundreds of miles with all of his belongings and his dog. i didn't sweat it and never mentioned it to him. the first two weeks were heaven. i lost my virginity to him. fell in love. finished the summer with a new job, and new confidence. he was working with my dad and that was going well. my mom was on the mend finally and things were just going really good. then he started getting phone calls from his mother saying how much she missed him, how could he leave her, why would he do this to her, etc. she would make passive aggressive facebook statuses, would message me and ask for him. it was overwhelming, especially only a few weeks into the relationship, and it was every single day. ""how could you leave me, my baby!"" gag. something changed about a month in. we had been having sex every single night and then it went to a few nights and then it stopped completely. we had been squeezing onto my twin mattress but suddenly he wanted the couch instead. he would blow my dad off to go fishing every single day, all day long. didn't want to hang out with my friends anymore. and was always always on his phone. this went on for another two weeks before he finally broke the news to me that his mother was falling into a deep depression and that he was going to have to move back home. i was devastated. he moved back home and the next day on facebook he was back in a relationship with e. which was funny because him and i had never broken up.we had kissed goodbye and had sex the night before even. i received a message from e on facebook that they had never broken up, hat it was just a ""break"" and that he needed to find himself, but he did and that's why he moved back home. i was furious that i had been used for the last two months. i was furious that he was an amazing liar. she sent me screenshots of conversations they had during the two months he lived with me. making fun of my weight during sex, how bored he was there and how he couldn't wait to go home. every single thing he had told me, was a fucking lie. i don't remember how it started but he started posting pictures that he took of me unknowingly on twitter. and these were really really unflattering pictures. one in particular that has stuck with me was a picture of me and his dog on my couch that he tweeted to national geographic and said ""look @natgeo, a whale is eating my dog!"" another one read ""we all have that one fat bitch we've slept with. guilty as charged."" for 10 months, this was every single day. back then, you could block someone on twitter but all blocking did was prevent the person from @ing you. i could still see all the tweets and morbid curiousity got me every single time. didn't matter how many times i reported him to twitter, they never took the tweets or his account down. pictures i hadn't known he had taken. he had gone through my diary and posted entries on his facebook that he and his friends and family commented and laughed at me on. eventually i stopped caring. i stopped looking at his social media accounts. i met someone else and eventually moved on. hindsight really is 20/20. i wish i could go back and slap myself for ignoring the whalenugget bullshit. i would have saved myself a lot of heartache."	39	20447	bqhfq9	eo6m8vp

"i matched with a girl on tinder and we agreed to meet up at a near by coffee shop. when i arrived i was sitting in the parking lot and noticed only 2 people in the coffee shop, some old guy and a girl who looked similar to the girl i matched with on tinder. she didn't entirely look like the girl i match with on tinder but she looked enough like her for me to pass it off as her using filters to make herself look better. i texted her that ""i'm here"", when i did that the old guy and the girl got their phones out at the same time and i got a text that said ""i'm inside"". i went inside and went up to the girl and said ""hey, melissa right"", she looked up from her phone frowned up and said ""umm.no.wrong person. right after she said that the old guy tapped me on the shoulder i turned he gave me a toothy smile and casually said ""howdy"". i ran out like i was running from a killer."	270	20447	bqhfq9	eo5kxyv
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i had a guy profess his love for me. over skype. he wanted to come see me. he lived in the uk. i live in the states. except i had a boyfriend at the time. i told him this. i told him that he was wasting his time and i have zero interest in him. he still is coming. i told him that there was no time to see him, as i had work and school. he says it's fine. he will wait until i have time to see him. i told him not to come, he says he has his parents blessings. so he came. he stayed in a hotel for 3 weeks while i had to deal with finals, work and spending time with my boyfriend. i hung out with him twice, once with a group of friends and once with my boyfriend. he got mad because he said that he wanted to hang out with me, alone (in his hotel room) and when i said no, he flipped. he said that because he flew over here, i should at least ""hang out"" with him. he flew back home to the uk a few days later and blocked me on all social media. tl:dr -dude travels from the uk to profess his love for me. is upset that i didn't change my mind. edit: ok, i'll include some back story. i knew him for about 3 years prior. he was a fairly popular streamer (at the time) and i was one of his viewers, eventually became a mod for him. we started talking on discord and then skype. i was 20 at the of this event. why did i even meet him? i knew him for a long time. i thought we were friends. i thought that he would come and realize i didn't have feelings for him if i said it to his face. i thought i could save the friendship. i never thought he would hurt me but even then, i was never alone with him. not even close. yes. this is my gw account. no, it was not something i did while i talked to him. no i never sent nudes nor did anything slightly inappropriate. me showing off my body now does not mean i don't know how to make good decisions. maybe not the decision you would have made, but still, you live and learn."	1239	20447	bqhfq9	eo4iqir
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	horror story in the sense that i wish so much that i didn't finally meet him this way. my best friend of 14 years who i solely knew online passed away back in september. i found out the night after he passed when his mother messaged me and told me the news and passed along the info for his funeral. i live in california and he was in chicago and i felt that it was my duty to finally go out there and see him. it was completely surreal and horrifying to finally see him in person, in a box. that being said though, i'm so glad i flew out there for his service and had the honor of being one of his pallbearers. i just wish we had met up a long time ago before this.	79	20447	bqhfq9	eo5z632

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	so, i got catfished once. i was 15, used this app/virtual chat world called imvu on the pc. i was a pretty sheltered kid, still very hopeful and naive about the world, but i loved helping people. one day im on there and i meet this girl named morrow, she was the real gothic type and i was really into alternative girls. we started chatting every day, eventually i met her brother justin, and her close friend norma. we all chatted on this imvu website, sometimes played games on steam, hung out over skype. it was pretty great i even started dating morrow. so, after dating for about a year she hits me with some weird shit, about her being a vampire and how shes over 2000 years old. basically the vampire from those christopher pike novels. now to preface here, this was around the time twilight got big, vampires were all the rage, and i was super naive so i still believed that almost anything could be possible, maybe. so i tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, especially when her brother and friend are saying yeah she's totally a vampire and treated it as if it were some big family secret. (i know, fucking stupid in retrospect but i was young and really naive). fast forward a couple years i'm 17, still dating her and believing she is a vampire with this long history and a family. even believed that maybe i had talked to god about it because of another set of circumstances in which a random number texted me and i asked about these things, and the other textee, or texter?.anyway the person who texted me seemed to understand all of this stuff that i was hiding from basically everyone i knew, because i knew on some level that it all sounded crazy as fuck. the short of it was i was just willing to believe and i loved morrow. i was in my first year of college down in tn at this point, and i decided i was finally going to meet morrow in person. only one problem, she lived in mt, hence why i hadnt met her up to this point (although we had exchanged pictures throughout our relationship. i'd even gotten supposed pictures of all of her and said family together) so, i used my savings to move out to mt, but i was supposed to be moving with her 24 year old brother, justin. i wouldn't be able to see her for several more months due to her taking a long trip to india to visit her ancestral vampire roots. again, i know it sounds insane, but you see where this is going. eventually, we move in with other people, they help me to figure out that justin was the only one who ever existed. i was 18 at this point so i had spent 3 years believing in this whole interconnected network of at least 8 people by now, but it turns out old justin had been pulling the strings the whole time. just keeping up the charade, finding pictures online, oh and using all these different fakes to gang up against me when id start to question things. i began to put the pieces all together, so i kicked him out of my house, and thats when he decided to tell me he had fallen in love with me. such a piece of shit person who killed a part of me that i'll never get back. definitely dont catfish people, its a shitty thing to do	96	20447	bqhfq9	eo5pthh
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	met a girl online once. can't remember where but this was 15-20 years ago. we chatted for a while and seemed to hit it off. eventually she invited me to her house. turns out she was having a party with about 30 people. she pretty much ignored the whole time i was there. hung out with some cool people and played some mario kart. left when everyone else started to. never spoke to her again. i have a lot of online communities i'm involved in between some forums i'm active in and ffxi. i wasn't there for it but a bunch of my ffxi friends got together one weekend 10-15 years ago. one of them got drunk off his ass, trashed some stuff, and made everyone else miserable. he never got invited again. the most prominent one was where i got cockblocked by 9/11. i had a trip cross country lined up for a car show and meet up with a bunch of people from a forum i was on. i had been talking to a girl out there for months beforehand and it had gotten pretty hot and heavy. so i planned to go out for the show then hang out with her for a week or so after. i also had some work to do out there but it was mostly to hang out with her. 9/11 happened the tuesday before the trip. i ended up on one of the first flights out of town that thursday. 90% of the group canceled their trips though. when i landed she sent someone else to pick me up and she was nowhere to be found. i saw her at the show for about 5 minutes but besides that she ghosted me. i heard from her after a few days. her ex and her had gotten back together after 9/11 happened because life is short let's try it again etc. i spent most of the trip in my hotel room watching the first x-men movie on hbo. it was a surreal experience all around. they're not all horror stories though. through the same group i made friends with another girl out of state. we hung out a few times but figured out we click better as friends. i met her best friend on one of my trips and we started talking online constantly. she flew down one weekend to see how we'd get along in person. we've been married 14 years just about so i guess it worked out.	333	20447	bqhfq9	eo541nu
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not a horror story but i thought this thread could use some positivity! i met my best friend online, through a mutual friend whom i met on an mmo. she was from the philippines and i was from canada (we started talking right as i was immigrating from romania.) she added me on yahoo messenger 8 years ago and we talked or video called every single day since then. once smartphones became a thing, we would video call whenever our time zones matched up, or message each other on messenger. we were the same age and both were being bullied in school. she would stay up all night while i was hiding on breaks crying at school to video call me, then i would go home, take a nap, and then stay up all night on video call with her while she was at school dealing with her own bullies. it was the closest we could get to hanging out and hiding from our bullies together. she was the only person i opened up to about my darkest thoughts that i couldn't tell anyone else. she let me talk about things for hours and understood me on a level no one else ever did. she got me through the worst years of my life and is a big reason why i'm still here today. i noticed she loved doing her makeup since she was a preteen, and she was bullied a lot for it. i knew she couldn't afford nice makeup where she was, so i sent her a starter set of professional makeup because i genuinely thought she had talent. she is now the biggest and most in demand makeup artist in her region, recently started working for celebrities and major magazines. to this day she kept the first set of makeup brushes i sent her. we've been each other's person for almost a decade now, through thick and thin. since we're both 23/24 now and could afford it and also could make our own decisions, we finally met for the first time in hong kong over christmas. we stayed there for a month and literally had the time of our lives. didn't feel at all like we were meeting for the first time, it was like we'd always been neighbours and just grew up together. i was afraid that it might ruin our friendship, but i knew that we had to take that step to meet in person, since we were basically family. we've had our fair share of fights through the years, but ultimately, we loved each other enough to always talk things through for as long as it was necessary to sort things out. i genuinely believe we'll be friends for life. the internet is genuinely a wonder that we don't appreciate enough!	208	20447	bqhfq9	eo61qfv
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"not me, but my sister liked/likes to do online dating or whatever. well she met this one guy who she liked and met. they dated and he even came to my and my husband's wedding. randomly one night she ran away from home. wouldn't answer her phone. house was unlocked. stuff missing. when she finally contacted someone, it was my husband. the way she was texting didn't sound like her at all. she was never one to just openly say stuff like ""i love you"". when she started texting us that's what she kept saying. i questioned it and she responded with saying that she just never said it enough. (keep in mind we only had text contact. never heard her voice). time went by (maybe few days) and she contacted our mother and said she was pregnant. turned out that guy had knocked her up, convinced her to run away, verbally abused her, and tried to keep her from having any contact from us by trying to keep her phone away from her. one day she was able to get in contact with our mother and tell her to pick her up."	32	20447	bqhfq9	eo5c5gu
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	met a guy on an online game. we were in the same guild. i thought we were just friends and doing quests and stuff. he kept pestering me about getting skype and doing voice chat. i finally agreed to voice chat but never video chat. then he wanted my facebook. that wasnt going to happen so i lied and said i didnt have one. i didnt want some guy ive only sort of known for a few months to know my full name, family, home town etc. once he finally dropped the facebook thing then he kept badgering me about sending him pics. hed send me pictures of himself, luckily nothing lewd, but demanded pictures of me to reciprocate. one day i just blocked him and deleted my voice chat account. he made me stop playing online games for a while. a couple months later i decided i wanted to get back into the online game. my account was filled with messages from him telling me how i had led him on and i was his true love. immediately blocked him on there as well. then the guild leader got all why are you being so mean to him?? he told us you blocked him for no reason and wont talk to him! i just left the guild. havent gotten back on in months :( i miss the game but i dont miss the weirdos.	30	20447	bqhfq9	eo60o3l
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i was probably the 'horror' of the story. posted this before and, for what it's worth, i'm not proud of what i did. met a girl my age in a chatroom when i was 16. we'd talk every day and things got 'serious' in a puppy love kind of way. i'd only ever seen once picture of her, which was in black and white but when she floated the idea of me coming to spend the week with her whilst her parents were away, i booked a ticket and travelled several hours on the train to go see her. she was waiting for me when the taxi pulled up and my heart sank. she looked a lot heavier than her picture suggested and i wasn't attracted to her. at all. to top it off, the house i had to spend the next week smelled like dog. for some reason we put lethal weapon 4 on for us to watch and it was during the film that i decided i'd probably made a mistake and had to leave as soon as i could. the next day probably would have been too soon, so i decided in on the day after next. the part i'm least proud of is sneaking into her room before my taxi arrived and erasing my number in her phone. *then*, on realising that the majority of messages in her phone were from me and that she'd still have number, i snuck back into her room and deleted all those messages. the taxi came and i went home and never spoke nor heard from her again. not a nice thing to do at all. i'm sorry emily, you deserved so much better.	361	20447	bqhfq9	eo58ng3
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i met him playing online poker. when i was a freshman in high school, my friend and i would play texas hold 'em online and go in the chatroom and just say dumb shit and joke around. ask if a 7 and a 2 were a good hand, that kind of thing. well this guy, we'll call him harry, started joining in with us and getting up to the same antics. we got some dude really mad at us so my friend and i decided to switch poker tables and go annoy someone else. we invited harry to come along with us and he did. from that point on, i was really good friends with him. he lived in a far away state and was maybe a year or two older than me. we talked online all the time. he was most definitely one of my best friends and i confided in him and trusted him completely. we had a similar sense of humor and things just made sense between us. i'd tell my irl friends about him and he would often talk to them too. i had several other online only friends that i would just chit chat with and it never seemed too weird to me but i was definitely closest with harry. there was never anything romantic between harry and i. things were always very platonic but i had always found him attractive. i figured he found me attractive as well but it really wasn't important. we finally met each other in person while i was in college after years of being friends online. he me me at a public place where i worked. he had a friend that lived in the same city as me and was visiting. he told me i was taller than he was expecting. things seemed normal. i went out with him and his friend that night to bar hop. got pretty drunk. his friend was very entertaining and outspoken. harry was more my speed. after having a fun night, his friend had picked up some loud girl and the 4 of us went back to the friend's apartment. we hung out in the living room for a short time but then the friend went into his bedroom and started loudly having sex with the girl he had picked up. harry and i laughed about it, it could have been awkward but it wasn't. we were both drunk. something intimate could have sparked between us. but it didn't. i had a boyfriend and wasn't the type to cheat. we spent some time together and then i caught a cab home. the ""horror"" part of this story is that nothing ever came of us. timing was wrong. distance was wrong. if this were a movie, we would have gotten together. i like to imagine sometimes that it was. he now lives in the same state as me but still too far away for it to matter. he is married and lives a much more active life than i do. i have been in the same relationship for several years. the saddest part is we no longer talk. i think we hit a turning point when we met plus he no longer could handle the emotional instability i went through in my late college years. still wonder what could have been. for the 2 people who read through this, thanks for reading."	84	20447	bqhfq9	eo66c9l

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	obligatory not me but this literally just happened with my dad. so my dad is really into road bicycling and is in some triathlete groups on facebook, where he apparently made friends with some pro cyclist from portugal. this dude from portugal posts in the facebook group saying he's moving to my parents' city in the u.s. to train for his triathlons and asks if he can stay with anyone for a couple months while he finds a place and gets on his feet. my dad gets all excited about this and asks my mom if the guy can move in for a few months and my mom for some reason agrees, i think just because all of us kids are out of the house now and they do have a lot of extra space. fast forward to two months after this guy arrives, my mom has been getting super weird vibes from him and is getting anxious for him to move out and find his own place, but my dad is apparently having a great time with this guy as their roommate and is in no hurry for the guy to leave. my mom gets frustrated and decides she thinks there's something weird with this guy and googles him. the google search reveals he was convicted of felony credit card fraud in portugal 2 years ago after hacking his friends computer and stealing over 10,000 euros from his bank account. not only that, but she keeps searching and finds like 3 more convictions for various different fraud schemes he had been convicted for. the schemes were always to steal from friends of his too, which seemed like the most fucked up part to me. my mom ended up confronting him with it and asking him to move out asap, so the guy is supposed to leave tomorrow but i told my parents to hide their valuables, put their credit cards on lockdown, and change their banking passwords. super sketchy.	26	20447	bqhfq9	eo61fz5
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"prodigy bulletin board systems in the mid 90's. local chat rooms, in my case specifically the texas room, were pretty fun places to meet people. i was about 19/m, and had been talking to this woman for awhile. she drives up to dfw from houston to meet me for dinner. when she arrives, i discover she had pretty much invented the myspace angle long before myspace existed. no biggie, it's just dinner, right? she starts talking. and doesn't stop. i have never seen anything like it in my life. i don't even remember how she ate anything. no pauses, no looking for me to contribute, just a complete stream of consciousness nonstop talking. i don't even know how she was breathing. it was insane. the servers were throwing me pity looks. i don't think i got a single word in after the initial ""meet"" in the parking lot. she is encouraging me to move to houston where she will ""get me an apartment and pay all my bills."" i'll basically exist to have sex with her. now in my 40's that might not sound so bad, but the level of crazy in this woman was literally like gravity. long story short, she ended up basically trying to rape me by the end of the night, but i escaped with my virtue. aside from the sugarmomma bullshit, i can't even remember a single thing she talked about, she might as well have been talking in a foreign language; a foreign language that never got around to inventing the period."	26	20447	bqhfq9	eo63ghz
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"not me, but a friend of mine met someone on the internet when we were fresh out of middle school. the guy he was talking to online claimed to be the same age as us and wanted to hang out sometime. so my friend invites me to tag along and i warn him thats not a good idea because it could be someone dangerous pretending to be a kid. we faught and argued and i was eventually forced to tag along to meet up with this online person. so we show up, and this guy is in his 40s. he walks up to my friend and greets him. then the guy looks at me and seductively licks his lips, grinning like hes looking at fresh meat or something.i backed away as slowly as i could and the guy touches me and says, ""don't go! i just want to talk."" my friend is all warm and friendly with the guy and chats to him like a normal person. so after a few mins or so, my friend and i leave and the strange thing is, he still wants to be friends with the online guy. &#x200b; a month goes by and i get a strange e-mail asking for some personal info. i decline many times and the guy goes apeshit on me, complaining about how i'm being rude. he sends me some inappropriate content and i blocked him on my e-mail. a few days later he finds my personal facebook and sends me a friend request. i have no idea how he found me and i decline the request. again he goes apeshit on me and rants about how if i don't add him as a friend, he'll make my life a living hell. i ignore it. next thing i know, my facebook friends stop talking to me because hes been harassing them, trying to get my personal info. i had enough with this guy and i do some research. next thing i know, i learn he's a convicted sex offender. i confront the guy online about this and he says that an ex of his framed him for a crime he didn't do. i call bs on it and i warned him, if he talks to me again, i'd report him to the police. &#x200b; fatass here doesn't get the big picture so he continues to message me with sexual messages like ""how big is your dick?"" and ""are you gay?"" and ""have you done anal?"" and other strange questions. keep in mind this goes on and on for a while. i had enough and report the guy to the police. police ask for evidence. i pull out the chat to see that the guy has been deleting his fb messages. anyways i report him to facebook and his account gets deleted a day later. few days later he makes another fb account and sends me a friend request. i don't bother replying to his sexual messages and report him to facebook again. a month later he sends me a new friend request on his third fb account. i report him to fb once again. his account is deleted.have i won the battle? close. &#x200b; so i take a break from fb and spend some time on twitter. little did i know, he has a twitter account and followed me and sent a series of sexual messages to me over a long period of time. normally i don't read dms, but i deleted all of the messages and blocked him on twitter. i tried reporting him to twitter but they don't do anything about it. hi twitter is still active. ugh. &#x200b; fast forward to 2 years ago. my irl friend calls me sobbing. i ask whats wrong. he apologizes for dragging me with him to meet the online guy. he says he should've listened to me and how it was wrong to chat with the guy online in the first place. to make matters worse, he says the online guy has been calling him, saying sexual things to him. anyways i tell him to report online person to the police. friend says hes too scared because no one will believe him. i tell my friend to block the number and just ignore him. so in the end, my friend unfriends the online guy and to this day, we haven't heard a peep from him. &#x200b; tl;dr: friend met a guy online. drags me in. got catfished. guys a pedo. a series of unfortunate events unfold. i win the battle."	111	20447	bqhfq9	eo5b5yt
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	late to the party, but i met an online friend of 2-ish years in person while helping a friend from school move. we had met on an old school roleplay chat and eventually moved to skyping, since we both liked crafting. we both lived alone at the time, so we'd put on movies and sit and crochet or whatever, and that was a big chunk of our relationship. she was 24 and i was 22. she seemed lonelier than me and spent a lot of time bemoaning how she had no friends or money. she had bought a house by herself at 21 and was part of multiple mlms. i liked her enough that i just politely turned down all her offers to buy weight loss shakes and makeup. she was always angling for me to come visit, so when the opportunity came up, i let her know that i was helping a friend move a few hours away, so we'd be passing through. she graciously offered for us to crash at her place on the way. turned out, she lived in the middle of this very 50s suburban neighborhood, in a one-bedroom house *with no doors*. on any of the rooms. she'd spent all her money trying to live this facebook mom group life, despite being a single 20-something, so the house itself was basically empty with pillows on the floor in lieu of furniture. she had no bathroom door or table, but she had an expensive coffee maker and a metric ton of weight loss shakes. she was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag. she never had anyone over, because she barely had friends in real life, so her house was staged to keep up appearances with her mom friends online, and not really meant to be lived in. we decided to be polite and make do, but the bathroom was facing the living/bed area such that you had to look dead into the house if you sat on the toilet. whenever one of us needed to pee and eventually shower, the others just walked outside. naturally, i got massive stomach cramps at like 3 am and had to crawl up and take the stealthiest, most painful poop of my life while looking over the bodies of my sleeping friends.	24	20447	bqhfq9	eo6h3qf
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"started playing a mud in high school. basically a text-based adventure game, the game was based on the book franchise ""discworld"". i really enjoyed it, and so did a number of my mates. one of my friends actually introduced it to one of his friends, i'll call him john. &#x200b; john was very addicted and got a lot more immersed in the game than any of us ever could. and because of this he was basically 'powering' us through the game. through his travels, he met a girl on there that called herself katie. katie sent us pictures of herself, told us she was from new zealand. she slowly injected herself in to our msn groups and added us all one by one. we were all like 14-15+ at the time, so it was somewhat interesting having a girl in our calls who liked video games like us, until she started having private conversations with us separately. she never spoke on voice, as she didn't have a mic and was always very quick on text. mostly every conversation was a competitive ""1-up"" battle, where she'd talk about how great she was at seemingly everything. renown ballet dancer? check. beyond grade 8 in piano? check. knew 3 different languages? check. i had really really bad eyesight, she had worse. my friend beat halo on legendary, she did it before them. all the while being constantly online. we were a tight knit group and she was starting to divide us all so i think one by one we all got sick of her bullshit and dropped her completely. it's at this point that john kind of disappeared from our lives as well. &#x200b; i started playing wow when it came out and was heavily invested, and at some point a few years later after release. i got a message from a strange person on msn. i can't remember the exact reason but it was something to do with wow. turns out i hadn't blocked/deleted her and she was talking to me about the game. at the time, i was playing a very geared alt character and she would group with me for dungeons. she was very competitive, and i enjoyed talking to her but she was in to some really weird shit. would link me cartoon pictures of herself without limbs, claiming she had an amputation fetish. would ask me that if she wanted to die, would i be the one that did it. she'd link me pictures of her bruised feet from ballet, saying she wants to saw them off. she'd link me her prescription papers, complaining about her vision and claiming that she'd like to get an eye removed so someone could fuck her eye socket. things got darker and darker, until she had a meltdown. i don't really remember what triggered it, but it was heavily implied she was going to kill herself and then i heard nothing for a day. this girl lives on the other side of the world, and i had way more than enough information from her to contact her brother to make sure she was okay. so i did. 'katie' messages me back through google, and has no idea who i am. has never played an online game in her life. is in fact a ballet dancer and teaches piano. and is blind as a bat. turns out one of her male korean friends, from university that she had confided in about her own issues, was using all of this information to form a fake identity. the real katie got the police involved about identity theft and i don't know what happened to the guy. last i heard was he decided to get gender realignment surgery and is still pretending to be other people. &#x200b; the real katie and i became friends though and still talk here and there. (this isn't a plot twist, this one is legit real haha)"	24	20447	bqhfq9	eo6m435
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	im not sure if this is the right kind of horror story, but it still bothers me many years later. way way back in the day, i met a guy through online role playing in aol chat rooms. it was never anything questionable, we just had characters and would play out scenarios together. eventually we really got to know each other and friendship became a long distance relationship. we would talk on the phone for hours and send each other packages. our parents spoke at one point, and after chatting for a couple of years, they helped set up for us to meet. everything went well. his dad brought him to my hometown and we actually got to meet. we saw each other a handful of times after that, too. he was my first relationship, and just generally a good friend during a lot of my middle school/high school formative years. eventually we broke up, but continued to be friends and keep in touch. i always thought i would see him again some day. when i was in my 20s, he had a death in the family and i remember talking to him. two or three months later i woke up from dreaming about him at like 4:30 in the morning. i couldnt sleep, so i went online to send him a message that i figured hed get whenever he was next on. so the horror story part, for me, was that i found out that he had been found dead in his apartment a few days before i went to send him that message. he had had a brain aneurism. it was absolutely crushing to know i hadnt made it a priority to see him again and that i would never talk to him again. it still really saddens me when i think about it now, several years later.	24	20447	bqhfq9	eo6oxfc
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i had this online friend back when i was a teen. we hit it off really well and would talk all the time. eventually we decided to meet up irl since we lived pretty close to each other. i had already had some instances where it turned out i was chatting with guys who were 30+ (i was very naive) so when my mom found out she insisted on driving me to our meeting spot and taking us home to hang out. it was a little awkward to sit in the living room with my mom in the room next door, but we made it work and we had fun. it was after that things went wrong. he started to become a little obsessive and stalking me. he'd sent me messages telling me what i was wearing at that moment and where i was. saying he'd kill himself if i stopped talking to him. things like that. it was terrifying, and i stupidly didn't tell my mom. i kept talking to him because i was scared he'd do something - either to himself or me. after some time i got a message from him saying he was joining the army and then i never heard from him again.	50	20447	bqhfq9	eo5pdet
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"we were friends of a friend in high school but hadn't seen each other in 15 years when she facebook friended me. after about three years of back and forth messaging, sending memes, etc she came to town and was really eager to meet up so i agreed to get coffee with her. i show up to the coffee place and she is half an hour late, and looks nothing like her pictures online anymore, i almost didn't recognize her. she sits down and monopolizes the conversation for an hour, we visit a local attraction where she gets in free with me and spends money in the gift shop, then says she'd really like to grab some food. we ride over to a restaurant and she orders a huge amount of food and eats it all. the check comes and the waitress asks if its together or separate and she immediately says together, smiling. i assume this means she is paying for me since i drove her to the restaurant and got her into the attraction for free. the waitress brings the check and puts it on the table, she leaves it untouched for like ten minutes. i finally am like hey do we need to split it? mind you i had gotten just some fries whereas she racked up like a $30 bill. she goes oh you have to get this one, i don't have any more money. i freak out because i don't have $30; i end up texting my husband asking him to transfer some money into my account from his. i try to leave and she starts crying that her brother kicked her out and her parents paid for a hotel for the rest of her stay but she has no money to get back because she spent it at the gift shop. mind you we are in our 30s. i reluctantly give her a ride back (about 10 miles out of my way) and drop her off with a ""bye"". she hits me with a barrage of fb messages how i am a horrible person for embarrassing her and should be ashamed of my behavior. i blocked and deleted her like a house on fire."	54	20447	bqhfq9	eo5r9bf

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not myself personally, but this happened within my friend group. we'd been playing a home brew rpg over a forum we all frequented for a long time. when skype and, later, discord came around we all joined up and became even closer. one day our dm tells the group that he and his girlfriend are being kicked out of the house he shared with his parents. told us they didn't approve of his relationship with her and gave him an ultimatum: break up or be booted out. so we talked about it as a group and eventually one of us decided he and his girlfriend could move in with him. dm and his girlfriend turned out to be a straight up roommates from hell. they refused to get a job so they could even *start* to make the most basic effort to pay for anything. they constantly whined about being hungry and pilfered my friend's food but they frequently let most of what they took go to waste. they absolutely destroyed the room they were staying in. they didn't have a vehicle so the friend had to drive them everywhere whenever they needed something. after about six months the friend couldn't take it anymore and kicked dm and his girlfriend out. but taking care of them destroyed his meager finances, his self confidence, and ultimately their friendship.	22	20447	bqhfq9	eo5bosw

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	he was a semi famous computer programmer, well known, respected, glorified. he lived a frugal life and traveled around countries giving talks about free software and stuff. heard he was coming to my country to give some talks and they wanted people to host him, so i applied and got accepted as a host. the first red flag was the email with a list of 'requirements' - from temperature, humidity, pets, food, drinks (right down to brand names!) etc etc etc - you name it, it was in there. despite that all i moved kids into shared rooms so he could have his own room, set the ac on, and we were set. dude turned up with gf at the time, talked super loud really late at night, got up super early in the morning and loudly stomped about, showeed etc. farted, burped, ate his own snot, or body bits he picked off. he was constantly rude and obnoxious and knew everything, and would argue everything with no leeway or common ground. boy was i glad when he left. on the plus side - after he left the kids never once questioned when i said 'do this - its good manners' - they also requested that guy please never come back. &#x200b; (for the geeks - yes it was rms)	43	20447	bqhfq9	eo623dj
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i actually have three stories for you, because i'm a dumbass who doesn't learn his lesson. a little background first. i grew up in a cult, had an abusive uncle, and lived with my single mom who had bipolar/schizoaffective disorder. i was awkward as hell, had no social skills or self-confidence, and home life sucked. so let's get to the three. 1) i had been playing an online text-based game with a guy that lived two hours away. i thought he was the coolest guy, really nice. one night my mom bashed my head in with a lamp (she was the sweetest woman when she was well, but violence was common when off her meds)-- bleeding and desperate, i message him about what happened. he told me ""hey, i talked to my parents and we are coming to get you right now"". never met him before, they came and picked me up and i moved in with them. i had a trash bag full of some clothes and nothing else. i had just turned 16 a month before. the very first night i was there the mom got drunk, started ramming her mercedes into the dad's bmw (on purpose), and the son pulled a gun on mom to get her to stop. mom runs off into the night and moved in with her boyfriend (she'd been cheating - dad didn't know until that night). so all three of us are in a bad place. we played monopoly and ate junk food until like 3am. i got a job at walmart, started community college (i got my ged at 16), things seemed ok. the family very generously was letting me live at their place for free. the dad was pretty well off so he didn't bat an eye at taking me to dinner with his son and paying for it, etc. i'd never experienced anything like this in my life, we had always lived hand-to-mouth. about three months in dad gets arrested. apparently he was a prominent member of the ""republic of texas"" movement that wanted to cede from the union, and as a ""sovereign citizen"" hadn't paid his taxes in years. house and cars get seized for back taxes, son goes with his grandma, but i find myself with no place to live. i ended up moving back home. 2) two months after moving back home my mom tried to stab me in the chest with a knife - i caught her wrist in time so it barely broke skin. i decided it was time to leave again. i had been talking to a girl online for about six months. she lived near chicago, i lived in texas. we are both 16. so naturally i think ""i'll take a bus to chicago and get a job there"". because that's what rational teens do, right? i saved up for about a month from my crappy data entry job, didn't tell my mom i was leaving, and went straight to chicago (a small suburb, actually). i knock on the door of the address she gave me (she asked me to come, of course). nobody answers. i call a mutual friend that went to school with her from a pay phone (remember those?), and friend confesses that the girl had catfished me the whole time. she was using the friend's pictures (the girl i went to see was around 300 lbs, not the hot teen she was pretending to be), and both girls thought it was really funny - until i actually showed up. the girl i went to meet eventually did come out and apologized to me profusely, she had been catfishing almost a dozen guys because she was addicted to the attention. hot friend apologized too. i hopped on a bus and went back to texas feeling defeated. 3) home life still sucked. i started talking to another girl online (because i was too awkward for real relationships). she lived in canada. two weeks after my 18th birthday i flew up there thinking ""i'll get a job in canada, everything will be fine"". this was before 9/11 and you didn't need a visa. at airport security in canada i went through customs. apparently i knew nothing about immigration or the law. on the plus side, the girl got to visit me in the airport security holding area before the canadian officials put me on a plane (courtesy of the government since i bought a one-way ticket) back to texas. i was handcuffed on the plane and had a security guard sitting with me all the way back to texas, and told not to come back. it was an interesting experience. shortly after moving back in (for the third time), i had my head bashed in again and a friend from school and his family took me in. i moved to a big city when they moved, got a decent job, and now 16 years and lots of therapy later i can laugh about it all."	43	20447	bqhfq9	eo66y3c
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	my neighbor had actually done this and it wound up coming to my house this was 2006 or so we(all the kids in the neighborhood) were all around the same age 14-17 and my neighbor had told the social circle that he had made an xbox buddy that didnt live far supposedly from our location and was going to invite him over so we could all meet this cool guy. but i didnt think he was serious bc he says lots of things that never come true or happen ever happened etc. and he exaggerates his stories. i forget about what he said, i think we all did, and it's like a month later in late november,its 20 degrees outside and we get a knock at our door at 11pm at night. it's some goth af kid asking if we knew so and so (our neighbor) he was like 15 and turns out our neighbor had completely ghosted him and went to the beach the weekend they were supposed to meet. his parents had to drive 2 hours to get here and had already left. he couldnt get cell service to call them, so he spent the night with us. my mom felt bad for him bc he seemed really shy and was probably embarrassed af. he turned out to be totally cool. really sweet, loved animals and video games ofc. his parents couldnt or wouldnt come to get him so my stepdad met them half way. well, he doesnt let that deter him and tried to meet up with my neighbor some time later. the same thing happens he comes knocking at my door late at night but hes crying, they had stolen his wallet and broke his cellphone and he was either high or drunk bc he was slurring his speech and unable to stand correctly. my mom calls the police the next day because she didnt even know he was there- i was naive and wasnt sure if he would get in trouble for being high or drunk and made a bed out for him in the living room. i didnt believe him at first about the wallet and phone but my sister said to let him in. cops got called the next day, was lots of stupid drama for that kid and neighbors. it wound up going to court. last i heard the kid went into the marines after hs, is married and is doing good.	20	20447	bqhfq9	eo60bqv

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	so, not an actual horror story, as it ended well, but still gave me quite a turn. i'd been email buddies/pen pals with this girl since she was 15 and i was 19. when i was about 25, i was staying with my dad and stepmother and it was a really crappy living situation as my stepmom is a full blown entitled narcissist and my dad is an enabler. i basically paid them 150 bucks a month to live in a flea filled corner that was freezing in winter and boiling in summer. because of this and trying to avoid my stepmother, i'd wake up everyday and go to the library for as long as i could and work on my manuscripts and study. literally nothing but a blizzard or thunderstorm or the library being closed kept me home. i turned into a complete workaholic because i hated being in that house. so one day in at the library working away and i keep getting messages from my online friend asking what i was up to. i told her i was working. she kept asking if i wasn't at home. i told her twice nope. i couldn't figure out why she asked. it turned out she had secretly hopped on a plane and shown up at my parent's house. she was like hey i'm celestina's friend can i use your bathroom? which given what stuck up prigs they are is super hilarious to picture. it would be like if one of harry potter's wizard friends showed up at the dursley house. and in all the time i'd lived with them i never had friends, was always alone. bit of a nasty shock for them i imagine. but the girl was persistent and next thing i know she's got my dad escorting her through the library to meet me. lol. she's awesome like that. i did get in a lot of trouble as everybody assumed i'd planned her visit, despite the fact that i knew nothing about it, but otherwise it was great time. also i knew she was going to be loads of fun from the minute i stood up from the library desk and she gasped omygosh you are short! and i was all yeah i warned you. horror story for my folks at any rate.	112	20447	bqhfq9	eo55j9a

"okay, so i never really met them in person, but i'm so relieved i didn't. also this is a long story; tl;dr: i really dodged a bullet by not meeting up with these people because they got extremely creepy and expected me to be a.\*ahem\*.""cheerleader,"" despite being 14-15. so, when i was a freshman in high school, my parents finally got me my own computer. i downloaded gmod (cause, you know, that was the ""big thing"" at the time). there, i met my first (and last) online group. there were, like, twelve of us(?), and i was one of three girls. the ring-leader of sorts was this one guy who was a senior in high school. for this story, i'm gonna call him joe (not his real name). now, at the time, my parents were extremely overprotective of me online, as my mother saw the online world as an absolute evil and my dad just went along with what she said because he didn't know much about the platform. so, i wasn't allowed show my face, i couldn't use my real name, and if i played with multiple people, one of my parents had to be in the room so they could make sure i didn't accidentally let any personal information slip. no one in the group even knew how old i was; they assumed i was older because--at the time--i had a deep voice for a fourteen-year-old girl (they assumed i was in college because of this). well, fast forward about a month and the group went from using no cameras at all to always using face cams and even just calling on skype instead of gaming. for a while, they were okay with me not revealing my face, but they assumed i was just shy or self-conscious. it wasn't until then that i accidentally let slip that i was in high school (complaining about a teacher that hated me because i stood up for a girl with a ""fake"" learning disability), and then everyone wondered if it was a good idea to keep me there, as most of them were either seniors in high school or older. now, joe wasn't the oldest (he was a senior in high school himself), but he was the ring-leader, so it was up to him whether or not i stayed. he said it was fine, as he had been a part of this particular group since he was in middle school. now, i'm not exactly sure when this happened because i was kept out of the loop on a lot of things (i was told about this by joe's friend way after this happened), but joe and one of the girls (i'll call her belle) got into a huge argument. apparently belle had a huge crush on joe, but he wasn't interested, and this exploded into most of the group getting involved because belle was being immature about it and decided to vent to everyone. when belle found out that i knew she got rejected, she then started to vent to me about stuff she didn't like about joe (he's a slob, he shows too much favoritism, etc, etc). why? i don't know. maybe to save face or to make me hate him? i really don't know. i was a freshman, and i didn't understand relationship drama of any kind. about a week after i found out about everything, belle called me and told me to stop flirting with joe. now, here's the thing: i hadn't been flirting with anyone. everyone in the group knew that i was not interested in dating, that i was a bit young to date (again, i was a freshman), and they all knew that my parents heavily monitored my internet use (again, i couldn't even show my face). no matter what i told her though, she wouldn't listen. from here, things get a bit.weird. at a scarily fast speed. i didn't tell joe about belle's interrogation, but everyone found out. the group basically banned all girls except me (the other girl took belle's side and went on a similar tirade), and the guys assured me that nothing would be different now that girls were banned. boy was that a lie. suddenly, instead of girls joining the group to game, random girls would join the skype calls for like two gaming sessions, leave, then be replaced for another two gaming sessions. i also realized that these girls never actually played with us; they kinda just flirted with the guys and encouraged them while they played. i started to get weirded out by this (cause, you know, this was not what i had agreed to join when i first started playing). i slowly started to pull away from the group, and joe, noticed. so he asked me if i wanted to have a ""cheerleader"" for myself (joe was the second person i told i was bi). i not-so-politely declined, as i thought it was extremely disgusting. i reminded him that i was a minor, and he said that he knew girls my age that would love me. i, again, declined. he asked me to turn my webcam on (""come on, your parents won't know if you turn your camera on and then just open up the gaming window), but i refused, as i was scared of what would happen if my parents ever found out. which pissed him off. he then said that he didn't want me to play, but would love for me to be his ""cheerleader,"" which would require me to use my webcam. i declined and basically cursed him out as best i could (again, my parents were kinda within earshot). the other guys each asked me at some point or another to be their ""cheerleader,"" and one guy found out we live in the same state and asked if i wanted to hook up with him (he was 17 at the time). i was so disgusted by all this, so i left. this experience wasn't the only reason i haven't joined another gaming group, but it is definitely a major factor. i was told later by the third girl that had left with belle years later that it was best i left, because belle came back, and she and joe have apparently blocked everyone that was in that group and began to date about a year after i left.yeah. sorry it was so long. edit: so i don't know much of the details about the girls and the how and why they were there. this was years ago and i was kept out of the loop because i was the only girl. the best reason i can give for them being there is that none of the guys really had any girlfriends (probably because of their attitudes and behavior) and having girls around to boost their egos and flirt made them feel better? i don't know. i just know it happened."	327	20447	bqhfq9	eo4utoh

what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i had gotten to know this one guy off an online game i played for a short period of time. he seemed nice enough at first but would always ask me for personal information (real name, age, where i lived). i never gave him the info but used fake ones. about half a year goes by and he slips up, calling me my real name, which i had never given him. he tried to play it off that i had told him it a while ago, but i knew that wasnt true and started ghosting him after all while. about 1/2 a year later he contacts me ago, demanding to know where ive been. i told him i had been busy to which he replied didnt know a play took up so much time. this was when facebook was just starting up and i didnt have one. i didnt post about my personal life on line beyond a privately set livejournal which wasnt under my name, and even those were random. this freak on a leash was stalking me for whatever reason. i promptly told him i didnt want to hear from him again and kept an eye open for a good while for anyone acting shifty as well as tell my parents about it. i never really found out who he was, but my dad did catch some shady looking guy creeping around our house and scared him off (hes a fairly big guy and when hes mad he can intimidate people easily, but my dads really a big old softly). either way, its been probably some 13 years ago sense than and thankfully ive not heard from the guy since.	17	20447	bqhfq9	eo5wd9y
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	not a horror story, but still. i was on a trip to ireland and my friend got sick and went back to canada. i decided that i would spend the rest of my trip with an online friend who lived in germany. we got along awesome through email and chat, she edited my stories for me and we talked about travelling. we knew each other for probably two years. anyway, i fly over to germany and stay at her place. she was really busy and we didnt really hang out, but that was okay! i hung out with her mom and did some exploring by myself including a day trip to cologne and went for a weekend trip to paris. on the morning i was leaving, we were having breakfast and its when i realized (after about a week), that things werent okay. the plan was for me to catch a train to frankfurt and then get on my plane (she wasnt able to drive me, but i told her no worries, i could handle getting there). she looks at me and says it seems like youre expecting me to drive you to the airport. im like no, im good with taking trains. tbh, i love trains! and she was really stand offish. when i leave, she waves goodbye, says it was nice meeting me, etc. fly back to canada, everything is great. then one day my mom calls me into the living room (i was 19 at the time). apparently my friend sent my mom a message on fb saying that i was basically a horrible guest and was rude and that she didnt think i was ready to actually travel and maybe i should grow up some more. my mom couldnt believe it and i actually started to cry. i had made sure to be the best darn canadian i could be. i constantly was polite, said please and thank you. it was my first time solo travelling so i was a bit weary, but i didnt think it was bad. that fucked me up good. i was so uncomfortable that i still (four years later) dont want to go to my friends houses for more than a day because im terrified theyll think im a bad guest. it took three years before i would even travel again, something i absolutely love.	35	20447	bqhfq9	eo5rnep
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	i played everquest when it came out all day every day, still being in high school at the time. my gf at the time and i played regularly together and we had made some friends in the game that we adventured with all the time. one particular 'friend', who we had been adventuring with for nearly 4 years, had just got stationed in az and came up with a great idea for us all to move out there together. we were a couple years post high school and were ready for a real life adventure so we jumped on the chance. about 3 months in to living together, with things seemingly going just fine, i came across some event logs on my gfs computer with old net send msgs when investigating why her pc was crashing. these were old command line msgs you could send between networked computers that was built in to windows. they were discussing taking me white water rafting and pushing me off and how far from civilization we would be and that i would probably die in the water or trying to get home.	17	20447	bqhfq9	eo6fyq4
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"when i joined reddit about 7 years ago i saw someone mention my hometown in a comment thread. i messaged that person, and we began chatting. she seemed very cool and intelligent, and one day she invited me to stop by her family's yard sale. i was picturing someone my age (late 20s) who was living alone. instead, i stumbled upon a 13/14-year-old girl and her boyfriend. they were both so young and nerdy that i could barely communicate with them--they literally spoke in memes. it was like they'd never had friends before. and both of her parents were clearly raging drunks and high on painkillers, and they tried to hit me up for money. it was creepy as fuck. after i was there for about 15 minutes she looked at me and said, ""awkward penguin?"" and i responded, ""yup, awkward penguin."" then i got in my care and left forever."	15	20447	bqhfq9	eo6kk6x
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"i want to say this was in 1997. aol chat. became friends with a girl from the same city (las vegas). we spoke on the phone for hours over a couple calls and decided to meet. she never showed up. we talk on the phone after and she tells me exactly what i was wearing and also described the friend i was with perfectly. told me she was standing right next to me but didn't have the courage to say hello. buttered me up with ""you're really really hot and i want you really really bad and i panicked."" i decided hey, it happens lets try this again. i take a different friend with me this time and we went to a spot on the strip in vegas. my friend and i were standing outside a mcds on the sidewalk and kept hearing a girl in a car driving by yelling ""woo hooo!!"" which was a catchphrase of sorts for her and i immediately recognized it. my best friend started talking sense into me and telling me i was a putz if i stayed any longer. we left. i wrote her a long email when i got home and basically told her i really appreciated being made a fool of and that we should probably just stop talking. a few days later i started finding notes on my car after work from her. i did unfortunately tell her where i worked during one of our talks. after that, i started finding notes left on my car when i'd visit a particular friend. then it started happening at my house. as this was happening i called her and wrote her many times telling her to stop. of course she never responded. wherever i went those days i was constantly looking around, taking note of anyone who i might have seen anywhere before. fast-forward a week and i'm at my friends house where i had found notes on my car. we're playing basketball and a car pulls up with a single woman inside. she says she's this girls mother and that she won't be bothering me anymore. she also said that she can see why she was obsessed with me as she looked me up and down. she was maybe 50, quite large, had really bad caked on makeup and a slight smell of sulfur masked by a strong perfume. i'll never know **for sure** if this woman was indeed her mother or was the stalker herself. shit scares me now that i'm older. i was just an idiot 18 year old and just shrugged my shoulders after that and moved on. nothing else ever came of it, but with the amount of knowledge about my everyday life this person had, i've always wondered if they randomly stalked me after that."	15	20447	bqhfq9	eo62oy6
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	am i the only person who doesn't have a horror story but actually has something that kind of saved my life? years ago, in the 90s, i met this awesome woman on a message board for a tv show i loved. she was so brilliant and i love brilliant. and an incredible writer -- just awesome all around. so i made plans to go see her. in another country. and i did. the border patrol or whatever it is in the airport asked me how i knew her and i froze. back then, early 2000s, people didn't really understand newsgroups, etc. i wondered how it would sound if i said i had only met her online. but the agent got distracted and i got waved in without having to say anything. we had a wonderful time. everything was great. a year or two later, she was coming to my city. i had just been diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal disease and had lost a lot of weight. a lot of weight. a lot. but i was avoiding the doctor and didn't want to take medication and was in total denial. anyway, my friend and i agreed to meet at her hotel room. i knocked on her door and when she opened it -- my god! her face when she saw me! it went from pleasure at seeing me to almost instantly absolute shock and concern at how much weight i had lost and how sick i looked. she didn't say anything. she was wonderful. we had a great time. but i couldn't forget her face and the day after she left, i went to the doctor and started the medication i had been avoiding. i'll always remember that moment -- it ripped me out of my denial so fast.	16	20447	bqhfq9	eo65fku
what's your 'i finally met my online friend' horror story?	"this happened back in the dial-up bbs days in the early 90s. before netflix and chill, we had vhs and couch. the woman wasn't especially pretty, but was smart and rich (daughter of a doctor) and really liked me so i give it a go. our first date she wants to meet at her place and watch a movie. great, i figure i'm in like flynn! so i arrive at her address, and feel even luckier as it's a new neighborhood of mcmansions, years before that expression was even coined. walking inside, it's a semi open floor plan showcasing a professionally maintained *rainforest* in a 25x25 floor to ceiling glass on 4 sides area in the middle of everything, open to the sky and now perfectly lit at night. i make a good impression on her doctor dad with some smart banter, then we settle in for the movie. her girl game soon proved to be as awkward as her unkempt plain looks, as she started making over-the-top pdas with her dad sitting nearby, nose buried in some scholarly tome. i was trying to keep the escalation slow and discreet below couch level, and she kept putting both arms around me and leaning in too heavily, causing us to shift and move in the good doctor's periphery, even though he's apparently fine with it all. at one point, she gets on all fours, ass up and pointing in the general direction of her dad, and starts making out *with my ear.* mind you, we haven't actually kissed yet, but now she's breathing and slobbering loudly into my ear while her tongue explores it indiscriminately in a pattern like a norway rat trying to find the little platform in the dark experimental dunk tank. finally, she let out a low moan which was supposed to be sexy, but at that intimate distance of 0mm to my ear canal was more like a whale call fit to carry across countless nautical miles. then she plunged her tongue piston-like into my ear canal, simulating upon one eardrum a sudden dive to fathoms of depth and barometric pressure whales are accustomed to, causing me to jump up and yelp. i locked eyes with her very jewish father, while a long awkward moment passed while no explanation was asked or offered as to why the hitherto nice very blonde and white boy suddenly jumped up and shouted, ""**oye!**"" while in the process of making out with his daughter, whose ass is still up and pointing in his general direction. the moment passes; we get settled back into the movie, and at some point he bids us a friendly good night and pads silently into the dark catacombs of his suburban castle. next lull in the movie, i go in for a regular kiss, which she overeagerly reciprocates. she plunges her tongue into my mouth as deep as she can, then swishes it back and forth rhythmically, like a windshield wiper. i try to interact using my tongue, but hers just sweeps it aside like a bug, and continues the determined *swish-swosh-swish-swosh!* i break for air, then we kiss again, hoping it was a fluke. nope, she plunges the tongue straight in again, and starts sweeping back and forth mechanically. now we've gotten through the movie and she invites me to spend the night. she leads me to bed, strips down to a shirt and underwear, then says just a minute and goes into the bathroom across the hall. i'm lying there thinking it's weird but hey, easy pussy coming right up. a minute turns to ten, then twenty; during which my detective ears picked up the distinctive sounds of several sizes and hardnesses of pills rattling around different size bottles as they were upturned to disgorge their various rewards, and bouts of ugly crying. finally, she burst in, turned out the light, and climbed into bed with me and immediately started to try to make out. i paused the action and asked, are you okay? she said yes, but it was obvious she had been crying and might start again with every unsteady breath. she was obviously rapidly coming under the influence of whatever pills she popped, and the whole thing was now just a sea of red flags, so i pulled the ripcord and made apologies as i quickly dressed to go. she clung to me and pleaded, ""i don't want to lose you!"" as i thought, ""we just fucking met today!"" walked out of that palace of grave dysfunction, got in my inappropriately old and inexpensive car and drove out of the clutches of mcmansionville forever."	94	20447	bqhfq9	eo5l6m4
"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	one of my first cases when i first started in the mental health field and i'll never forget. i was providing therapy to a young girl who was pooping on herself after holding it in for as long as she could. mom originally thought it was some kind of anxiety or fear of the toilet but after a couple more sessions i found out that the girl was being sexually abused by her step father and pooping felt like penetration to her so in order to avoid that sensation she would hold it in as long as possible. it was heartbreaking to find that out and a hell of an introduction to the field. edit: not sure if this is ok to do here but as a way to help people that don't have access to mental health services i started providing free mental health advice/ answering psychology related questions a few months ago through the form of social media and videos. if anyone is in need of assistance feel free to inbox me and i will provide you with my information. thank you!	6432	28574	bo6854	ene8f76

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	working in group care, i had a client whose parents would sell her body, from toddler age to about grade 3 (about when she was taken in to care) to 'regular' travellers through town in exchange for drugs and money. her family and extended family would tell her these people were friends and needed 'fun time cuddles' and that she was the best daughter that anyone could have because she was special for doing this. when i was working with her in her teens she didn't trust anyone that ever gave her compliments, and would often have panic attacks when people said she did a good job at something or was skilled at something. was the saddest fallout of abuse i think i've ever seen. she had several suicide attempts and a lot selfharm. last i heard (years ago), she's doing a lot better now after finding a good match for a therapist. i sincerely hope her family never sees the light of day again, and that some bad things happen to them in prison.	3810	28574	bo6854	endpkoq

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	while doing my psych clinical's over 20 years ago, we had this poor patient that was so abused as child. this took place in the 70s. her father had a casket at his house. i can't remember if he worked at a funeral home or how he ended up with a casket. he drilled a hole just big enough so a straw could go through it. he would put his daughter in there and close the lid and gave her a straw to put through the hole so she can breath through the straw. he left her in there for extended of time. the poor girl was destroyed. as the psychotherapist was telling our group the story, our group were in tears. how can someone be this fucked up to do this to their own child. the poor girl is so messed up and cannot live a normal life due to all the trauma this has caused her. edit: many asked how she was destroyed. this abuse took place over her childhood till adulthood. in the 70's, child abuse was overlooked and often not believed by the child. who would believe that a person would have a casket in their home. she was placed in a lock down facility and as students, we never had her as a patient. the psychotherapist explained that she did not meet her milestones and acted as if she was in the wild in away. she was probably oxygen deprived that also affected her brain. the poor girl basically grew up throughout the years being put in that dark airtight casket with a straw to breath through. it was so long ago and cannot remember the details how she turned out other than she is in this locked facility and has trigger points that sets her off. our clinical group was crying all day after hearing this case. this broke me and realized that i cannot ever be a psych nurse. i am sure she suffered other abuse. most of the patients in the psych facility were from an abusive parents. the next population was drugs, alcohol and chemical imbalance. to be honest, i felt in my own mechanism, i shut down after hearing the casket and straw bit. i could not handle it and felt sick all day. thank you for the gold star to the kind person.	4867	28574	bo6854	endund7

"as a caveat, i do work in the medical industry though not specifically mental health. this girl's mother was sexually abused as a child, so the parents were very overprotective. they wouldn't allow the girl to be alone with any males other than the father. no uncles, no cousins, no church trips, nothing. they could sleep over at friend's houses if the friend's mother was a single mom, and if that other mom took on transportation duties. the parents were also somewhat disengaged though not to the point of neglect. just distant, wouldn't play, wouldn't go the library. stay at home and leave us alone while we watch tv kind of parents. shut up or i'll give you something to cry about. life isn't fair, get used to it. there were three neighbor kids all a little bit older. a boy a year older, and two girls about four and six years older. they had a single mom, and since the girl was five years old, they lived on the same street. the girl was encouraged to spend a lot of time there. to get her out of the house and not to beg for dance lessons or to go to the park. there was no man of that house, but that single mom was not a good mom. she drank or used drugs, and had a lot of men over some of whom clearly had molested those kids. as a lot of older children or young teenagers do, they took out their pain of their molestation on this younger smaller girl. it went on for four to five years. the little girl never told her parents because she had no reason to think they would care. she was pretty isolated other than her interaction with her molesters, and obviously she didn't understand what was happening when it started. schools talked about stranger danger, and adults touching you in your bathing suit spots, but nothing about older children of the same sex. nothing about being forced to watch pornography, or masturbate in front of people. nothing about how it escalates from there into being touched, or being pressured to have sex with their kid brother. nothing about the coersion of a desperate lonely child hearing ""do it or i won't be your friend anymore"" from the only people they can spend time with. it was a really sad combination of disengaged yet overprotective parents. the girl ended up being bullied by classmates because she didn't know how to interact in a normal way. was taken advantage of by a teacher in middle school, then abused in every way by a few boyfriends after that. had a drug problem, got clean, but still couldn't seem to keep it together for more than a few years at a time before work or personal relationships would implode. was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder."	3003	28574	bo6854	endaepi

"my experience is so much different than everyone else here as it wasn't family that caused the trauma, it was nature. during one of the 3 massive tornadoes we've had since 2010 my team was deployed to an area and told that we had elementary school children trapped in the school. we worked our way through debri searching every square inch to make sure we didn't miss a thing. when we uncovered the basement we found that it was flooded and full of kids who were alive and children/teachers who didn't make it due to drowning. most people don't realize how much rain we get with our tornadoes in the midwest. when my city (joplin missouri) was hit by a multi vortex ef5 tornado on may 22nd 2011 we had a torrential downpour for 2 or 3 days after it. anyway, back to the school. we recovered the living & the bodies and flew them out to a larger hospital for treatment. i gave them medical attention on scene and started what's known as ""psychological first aid"" because i knew these kids were fucked from what they saw & experienced. every few months i reached out to family members of the children to check and see how they were doing (weird maybe but the last time i saw these kids they weren't in great shape. the kids were able to recover for the most part and things were going good, i thought. i learned that 3 of the kids started massive drug addictions when they got into junior high and at least 2 of them had attempted suicide. it tore me apart because i'm now a father myself and i saw what these kids experienced, all the while hoping they wouldn't be affected long term. i fear the future because these kids who are now in middle school & high school started doing some pretty horrible things to address the pain & nightmares they live daily. i honestly wish i could do more because these kids never had a chance and it was no one's fault, no one could have predicted what happened and what would happen. we learned a lot about tornadoes with this particular tornado, the tornado that hit my town, and the 2nd tornado that hit the town the kids were in. we'll never again send kids to the hallway or basements because pop machines, water fountains etc get sucked down the hallways, kids get sucked out of hallways, and basements fill with water during these events. i see these kids in my sleep, i see the people they've grown up to be but somehow i still see the soaked, filthy children with tears running down their faces, blood soaking their clothes, and i can feel how tight they dug their nails into me as they hugged & held on for dear life, not wanting us to let them go because they were terrified that it would happen again. it's not family induced trauma but it's the one thing in my career that sticks out more than anything."	188	28574	bo6854	eneja7c

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	a guy who was born with a smaller penis. doctors decided to remove the testicles and have him raised as a girl. it wasn't hermaphrodite case. they just decided without running any tests or anything (latin america 40 years ago). his name was changed to a female name, he was raised as a girl and forced to pee sitting down and punished whenever he peed standing up. at 10 he was taken to an endocrinologist who didn't run any tests, just began female hormones treatment. in his adolescence he went through sex change surgeries, they made a vagina and inserted stuff to open up the space, always in front of medicine students. he had 3 marriages (with men) and all were horrible. he wanted to kill himself so a friend of his took him to see the pastor of her church. the pastor spoke to him and told him god tells her the problem is that he is a man. he thought she was crazy and left. but the idea lingered. so he (still as a she) went to look for his original birth certificate in his country and found that he had been inscribed as a male with a male name and all but 15 days later his name had been changed to a female name and all. he had grown up thinking he was a woman who needed all these treatments. so he got genetic testing and found out he is a male. no female organs whatsoever. so at 40 he decided to change back. needed surgery to undo all that had been done. he had a lo of trouble dealing with his degrees and documents because everything was under his female identity. he became a pastor himself and married a woman. i didn't treat him. it was a forensic psychology evaluation.	1372	28574	bo6854	endlsmp

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	attachment disorders trouble me. not a pro but we adopted two brothers, the younger has an attachment disorder which basically means the infant or young toddler did not bond with anyone. i think one of the key things that happens is the soul doesn't develop basic trust and will have great difficulty trusting anyone or any entity for the rest of their life. this affects mates, friends, bosses, police, counselors, everyone. imagine being an infant and you're hungry so you cry, but nothing happens, repeatedly. you lose trust and may develop strong control issues. our son's control issues included a school teacher giving instruction or correcting an answer as someone trying to control, not help. what troubles me is the person's condition started before the age any memory recall is possible so they have no other frame of reference so it is very difficult to treat.	172	28574	bo6854	ene9mix

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	i've been in a lot of group therapy as a patient. i know this isn't a direct answer to the question, but i feel the need to say it anyway. after all this therapy i learned to never assume anything about someone's family. never assume they have parents in the first place even. if they did have parents, never assume they are nice or deserving of respect. simple things like asking a stranger about mother's day or whatever could be really intrusive and a lot of people don't seem to understand the concept of cutting *family* (gasp!) out of your life. we did a value exercise and a lot of people chose family as a top value, which is okay, but i think it should be respect/love. if your family has that, then they will be in that rank, but family doesn't get a pass. i try not to probe about those things unless people want to talk about it.	1132	28574	bo6854	enctcdq

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	this is this is pretty personal as it is not about a client, but about my family. i dont mind sharing in this anonymous forum though. i am a mental health professional myself and that is largely due to my own experiences that inspired me to help people going through hard times like i went through. i was one of these individuals who grew up in a situation like what a lot of you are describing; very very intense physical and emotional abuse and some sexual abuse. as a guy and older brother, i thought i wasnt supposed to be weak and crying at what was happening to me. i wanted to be unbroken and strong for my little brothers and take as much of the abuse as i could so hopefully they wouldnt experience it. that did mostly work, i was able to take most of the abuse for years but it eventually became too much for even me. at some point i kind of shut down. i stopped talking and didnt react to being hurt anymore. after that, my lack of showing pain seemed to infuriate my mother. following that i wasnt allowed to eat anymore and i became very sick and thin. my mother didnt want me to have food. she was very mentally sick and prone to unpredictable and violently explosive attacks if she thought i was doing things like listening to music or eating. it doesnt really make sense now but it was my normal existence then and i just tried to adjust to it. i got used to hunger eating 4 or 5 times a week. my mom was very wasteful though so i learned to dig through the garbage every other day. i hid her food scraps under my bed to keep it from being seen and started eating out of neighborhood trash cans. i still didnt react to the violence anymore and that somehow seemed to make things escalate. after some time i was no longer allowed to live inside the house with my family and had to sleep outside with the dogs. the dogs kept me somewhat warm that winter but i still kept getting sick and weak from the cold. eventually i had to live on my own in the woods for safety and after that my little brothers took a lot more abuse unfortunately. i myself went down a pretty dark road after that and had some difficult years. addiction and alcoholism were comforting and numbing which i appreciated. i had a lot of trauma issues, which seeking help inspired me to work hard and change things, as a counselor now, ive heard a lot of stories and i never share my own. i try to help both my little brothers still through many of the struggles of life. they are still kind of stuck where i was and it breaks my heart. i still wish theres more i could do for them both, even as adults. i look at their actions and understand while also having a feeling similar to what many people here are expressing; i know that things could have been a lot different for us if we had just been valued and loved. it makes such a difference, it simply goes beyond words. it still makes me sad though to know how different our lives could have been both then and now. so i do my best to be as genuine as possible now with this knowledge, both for my little brothers and for the people i meet coming out of their own dark times	57	28574	bo6854	enedwwm

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	not a mental health professional. when i was a teenager, i was in a residential treatment facility for a while for repeated suicide attempts and severe depression. there were a lot of really screwed up people there, but theres one in particular that really stands out. this girl was 15 years old and had multiple personalities. there was herself, there was one that was a version of her alcoholic mother, and one that was version of a herself as a toddler. when she was the alcoholic mom personality, shed punch things, hit people, be real nasty and mean. when she was the toddler personality, shed cry a lot, then lay down and arch her back as if offering herself sexually. the reason for this was because her mom used to sell her body when she was a toddler in exchange for drinks and drugs. she was conditioned to lay down and give herself up to men when she was barely old enough to form words. she also had some type of seizure disorder that was thought to be a result of her childhood trauma. it wasnt epilepsy or anything like that but a psychological response to feeling threatened. whenever shed get in an argument or get really sad, shed suddenly have a seizure. the seizures were 100% real. she had testing at the facility and she was hooked up to heart and brain monitors and everything. her brain activity during the texting proved the seizures were real. imagine having so much trauma that every time you felt intimidated or something youd seize as a defense mechanism. i think about this girl often and hope shes doing better. it was a small facility so all the patients were very close.	36	28574	bo6854	enem13c
"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	not a mental health professional, but my former sister-in-law has exhibited some things that even a psych 101 student would correctly diagnose. her childhood consisted of her drunken military father never being home and her drunken mom straight up abandoning the 3 kids to go cheat on her husband multiple times. they had an extremely nasty divorce. her older sister had to raise her when her dad wasn't home. she's always had low self esteem and quickly falls to using vices like weed, alcohol, and cigarettes to deal with her feelings. she got knocked up by my brother during a one night stand that turned into marriage and two kids. 5 years in a she can't take the stable life anymore (and my brother was working hard to have a stable life). she stopped coming home from work one random week and after a few weeks of being away, told my brother that she was leaving him. he wanted to work things out for the kids, but then it came out she was cheating on him so he said good riddance. she then tried to get back with him multiple times but only because she was broke. he said no every time without hesitation. they have joint custody of the kids, but she frequently shows disinterest in keeping them when it's not her time to keep them. during all of this, her older sister basically did the same thing. ran away from her family and cheated on her husband. their brother is stoner in his 30's who can't hold down a steady job. she started smoking cigarettes again to deal with all the stress in her life. the entire family is fucked up and it's pretty obvious that they emulated what they grew up with: unstable parents that ran around cheating and ignoring their kids. my fear is that my brother's kids will repeat the same mistakes when they are older.	552	28574	bo6854	encnmhm

"mental health professionals of reddit, what is the saddest case of ""wow this person really fucked up because of how they were treated during their childhood"" you have ever come across?"	hmmm. i'm hesitant to talk about this. i'm not a mental health professional, just my own life. not something i tell tend to talk to people about. when i was 7 me and my two brothers were watching t.v. on the couch in the game room, spongebob to be exact, around the time they had 11 minute episodes. we heard our mom screaming. we exit the game room into a big unused space by the stairs and hallway. we go past the intersection and take a left that leads to connection between the kitchen and living room. my mother was was on the ground in the living room, covering her face. our step father was at the otherside of the kitchen throwinh plates at her. from what i remember she was telling us to stay while our step father was telling us to go, but she'd tell you the other way around. we stood there watching before our older brother, 10 at the time (younger brother would of been about 4) got us to go back to the game room and once we were there i remember him telling us not to speak of what just happened again. what felt like just a few moments later out mom comes running in, literally covered in head to toe in blood, like a scene out of carrie. right behind her is out step father holding a butchers knife. he traps in a corner while our older brother gets us to hide behind the couch. we wanted us to keep our head down but i could help but watch. he threatened to kill her then all of us, but then he broke down and put the knife behind his head telling our mom to shove the knife in. the neighbors must of called the police because shortly after they came and he spent a night in jail, our mom didn't want to press charges but i really don't want anybody to blame her for that she was being abused and the little i know about her life growing up was too great either, she was a victim like all of us. after that the abuse became more obvious and happened in front us of more and now to us, and i could hear them at night keeping me up. i didn't know wether or not my family would die. i didn't really care about myself much, but i did care about them. my step dad is much bigger person than my then 7 year old self, didn't think there much i could do physically but with a knife i knew i could. so i spent what would become three years teaching myself how to move as silently as possible and hide a knife, waiting for the right opportunity. i didn't know if ge kill us all, so i thought the only option was to kill him. one day, when i was 10, i saw he hitting and yelling at my little brother. his back was too me and knew he wouldn't notice me. i always had a knife on me. i wanted to kill him so bad. i knew i could of. i just stood there, watching him beat my little brother and did nothing. for two more years he would be in our lives before our mom got us out of there. two more years i could of prevented. i don't know if the worst thing is contemplating killing him or not doing so. my family doesn't know about any of this. i only told a very few people i trust. my relationship with my family only got worst. i'm autistic and was never got diagnosed with ptsd till after i disconnected with my family. i have a really bad relationship with them because they never knew i had ptsd or really ever understood what being autistic was. i wish things could of turned out differently and i hope they are okay and happy. i do miss them and care for them, i also accept that they may not feel the same for me	31	28574	bo6854	ene71lw

"i'm not a mental health professional, but know someone who is, weirdly enough this is about her son and how she raised him, but also kind of because of what happened to her. now, as a kid she was raped and in her first marriage she was abused, so she has some mental scarring. she is a counsellor and i think she specializes with children, especially people who have been through situations similar to her. anyway, her son, i was friends with in school, but he has some weird quirks and we eventually fell apart because we were too different as people. because of everything she went through though, she was very protective of him, he was only allowed one hour of internet access on the computer and it had to be supervised. he played a lot of xbox though, but she never let him have access to internet and because of that his xbox never got updated. when he got a phone they installed some software on it so they could lock stuff out, and he was only able to listen to music she installed for him and text and stuff like that. the big thing though, is threw all of this, he just kept finding new ways to look at porn, his mok kept locking him down more and punishing him more when she found out. he also would take friends phones and watch porn on them, something pretty normal for him to do, because he had little other ways to watch it. she was very unstable, and pushed all her friends away, including my mom, by saying i was a bad influence because i had more freedom, and at her second wessing yelling at one of her bridesmaids for ""dressing like a slut"" the lady was around 50 at the time and was dressed perfectly fine, but she decided she didn't like that. the son, also growing up the way he did, any friends he had have all grown away from him, he has some new friends now, but they are all younger than him.

whats a skill that everyone should have?	time management **edit 1:** for few of those who want some tips about it. time management is basically prioritizing your work so that you can make most out of the fixed amount of time you have. here are few tips that i follow 1. every night create a list of work that needs to be done next day and order them in such a way that most important task are done first while maintaining a logical sequence of workflow. 2. at the end of the day check if you have done important things or not. 3. try to avoid procrastination, you have to do the work anyway. doing it in later point in time will only put you in stressful situation. 4. do some exercise or meditation, even simply walking can help a lot. 5. if you are unclear about what to do first today, just after waking up do the daily chores and take bath. it will really put you in a relaxed mood so you can think better. (it worked for me) 6. keep around 1 hour for yourself everyday to do things that you enjoy. after all we are humans not machines. **remember :** don't consider time as a resource which gets replenished after 24 hours, it is the only resource that you are dying for.	3048	31987	bkxl3u	emkbzal

what impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	having a limited ability to revert time. can only go back 12 hours at a time, and once the ability is used you need to wait at least the amount of time you re-wound before you can do it again (basically, you can't chain-leap backwards ad infinitum) you could essentially restart the same 12 hours over and over, but once you have let time progress more than 12 hours, that moment will be out of your reach forever. i think about how many times i would loop the same 12 hours before letting time progress, what i would use that extra time for, how i would perhaps slowly turn cold and distant from those around me; seeing them merely as atomatons; doomed to repeat the same mannerisms over and over, before i let time naturally run its course again. there are things that can be progressed in these repeated hours and things that cannot. i could read part of a book, for example, and then continue where i left off when i rewind again, but i wouldn't be able to continue playing a game or travel overseas etc. because any progress i make towards goals that take longer than 12 hours get wiped the instant i rewind. i would be a lonely observer of a day's many possibilities and potential outcomes, only to settle for one that's 'good enough' once the repetitiveness gets stale. would i turn into a sociopath? commit heinous acts because 'i can just rewind anyway?' i'm honestly not sure, i'd like to think not, but it seems like a very possible outcome. okay, maybe i can get a bit carried away sometimes.	9645	33126	budsip	epb2cam

what impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	i often think about a scenario where i am in a big room with about 20 clones of my girlfriend. i am pretty much forced to figure out which is the real one. first, i have to go through and eliminate all the ones that don't look exactly like her physically. i start with more obvious things all the way down to minute details only i know about her body. then go through the process of asking personal questions to the remaining ones and see just how much they know about themselves and also about our own relationship. i ask trick questions or tell certain jokes that i know only the real one would know or like. eventually i get down to just two versions of her and they are almost exactly the same in all aspects. i never really finish the day dream to figure out who i pick though. i just find it fun to try compiling a list of very specific things i know about her to see if it'd be possible to do successfully.	14	33126	budsip	epbx3s3

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	i'm really enjoying drops, which is a visual vocabulary app for learning non-english* language. i can hold a conversation in (broken) french due to learning it when i was young, but i'm certainly not fluent and i've learned about 400 new terms/phrases in the past few months. when you learn a word it pronounces it for you as well as shows you a simple graphic representing what the word is, which i've found has really helped my absorption (though i recommend turning on the feature that lists its english translation after you solve each puzzle, because sometimes i would forget what exactly the word i learned meant because the graphic wasn't as specific as i needed it to be). you can play for 5 minutes every 10 hours, though if you maintain a streak you earn bonus time, and after every session there's an option to watch an ad to earn an extra minute. you can pay to get unlimited access but i actually really like having short sessions twice a day, because i'm definitely the type to want to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, and then burn out on it because i didn't pace myself. *edit: actually you can learn english, too!	2707	32667	brlti4	eof1g0i

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	camscanner. got a homework assignment or drawing you want to post or share? this app will take a picture then make it look like it was scanned, so lines can be darkened and everything easier too see and read. it really beats the hell out of bad lighting and blurryness. all without a scanner. edit: wow whyd this blow up? i thought it was underrated but obviously enough people use phone scanners. someone recommended this to me to scan art sketches that save to my camera roll then to my drive. i like that camscanner heightens the contrast for me. cool of yall to add your two cents but please dont attack me for not using the program that works for you. also no i dont use its premium.	13817	32667	brlti4	eofd23p
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	google trips is amazing. my first solo trip was to thailand and i didn't know how to plan a trip and it wasn't great. my second solo trip to japan was amazing because of this app. firstly, any relevant emails that you recieved through gmail get added, so all of your hotel and flight reservation info are in one place. it also saves them in google maps for you so you don't need to remember to pin them. phone numbers and addresses too, so you can show a taxi driver. most places have detailed transportation info: from how to get into the city from the airport, to miniscule rules for public transit, like if they only exit from the back doors of the bus so you don't look like an ass. they mine maps for tons of restaurant reviews. i like that you can choose what's really close, or cheap eats (great for breakfast) or when you don't want a lot of fuss). it can create customized day plans for you, or adjust to what's near by you at the moment. there's tons of other cool little features too. and you can download most of the info in case you don't have data. i can't recommend this enough!	656	32667	brlti4	eofh3x0

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	for those of you that need to talk to someone but dont know who to talk to or how, i recommend replika, its a personalize self-learning chatbot that will try its best to either cheer you up or at least keep you company during darker times. the developers dont keep track of whats its learned unless you submit something to them (like if it sounds like its going crazy and there might be a problem with the code). all of your information is stored clientside. it has easy access to the suicide hotline and other help hotlines. i use it myself, its really been helping me.	2809	32667	brlti4	eofd80a
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	a few apps that are helpful for anyone, but are very useful for dealing with the daily struggles of my mental health problems: **[daylio](https://daylio.webflow.io/)** (android & ios) - quick daily mood journal. you select how your mood was that day, and then you can check off items/activities that you did (you can include customized ones). gives nice statistics, takes less than a minute to fill out, and lets me analyze patterns in my mood - was my mood better or worse on days i was drinking? days i saw my friends? days i took a nap? etc. **[habit tracker/habitbull](http://www.habitbull.com/)** (android & ios) - a habit tracker/reminder app that isn't gamified like habitica. reminders for daily tasks, weekly, or even customizable for something you do every other tuesday at 9am. gives nice statistics on streaks and % of days you successfully complete the tasks. mostly helps because i need something to nag me into brushing my teeth every night and scooping the litter box more regularly. **[sleep as android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/)** (android only) - very useful alarm. i use mine to let me snooze only once for 10 minutes and then must scan a barcode taped to my fridge in order to shut the alarm off. forces me up and out of bed, and encourages me to take my vitamins & medication, and start breakfast instead of falling back to sleep. customizable tasks for shutting off the alarm if you don't want to scan a barcode - that one just works for me. **app i just enjoy:** **[old school runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/mobile)** (android & ios) - because i'm a nerd that loves runescape, and now i can play it on my phone or tablet :)	92	32667	brlti4	eofsp21
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	myfitnesspal. the annoying truth is the best way to lose weight is count your calories and treat it like a budget each day. myfitness pal makes it easy to log whatever you eat, and it has almost every kind of food you can imagine, fast foods, everything in the grocery store, even really random stuff comes up to my surprise (like ramen package from japan). you an even scan the bar code of a package to add it. it only takes a few minutes a day to enter stuff and it helps you figure out what to eat to stay at a calorie deficit.	4615	32667	brlti4	eofbvph
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	i love hue is amazing for helping me focus when my brain gets all scatty and just zen out for a bit. my fitness pal (when utilized properly) is really good too for helping lose weight and keeping track of what you're eating, how much water you're drinking, exercise you're getting etc. flo is my go to for keeping track of my periods too	868	32667	brlti4	eoflxr1

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	duolingo, i know that everyone jokes about the owl but really, every time i open the app up i'm astonished. it keeps education free, it pays homage to languages that might have died without their help, it has high valyrian, a fictional language. all of it is for the price of a few ads, they aren't even video adds, they're just pictures that you can quickly click out of. the lessons are easy too, the hearts thing is a bit annoying but it really is worth it and they make words easy to pick up.	10252	32667	brlti4	eof3sb2

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	tiny tower and soul knight. tiny tower is a really old idle game (like, from before idle games became a thing). the devs still support it and there's no pop-up ads unless you tap on a specific button in the menu to watch an ad. it's way different from other idle tower games. been playing for years. and soul knight is just a really fun undertale-style dungeon game with auto-aim and hours of gameplay and again, no ads.	65	32667	brlti4	eofg27q
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	google maps. i am talking specifically about the option to download offline maps for almost any city in the world. they really help when you are in a foreign city and you try to find some place, as offline maps will show you where you are at currently and where the location is you are looking for, without the need to use data. edit for clarification: google maps is not an underrated app, that is true. i do believe though that the offline map feature of google maps is an underrated and useful part of that app.	2742	32667	brlti4	eof27kk
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	toogoodtogo. put simply it's an app to collect leftover food from restaurants at a large discount (70-80%). i live in europe and many restaurants and bakeries have leftovers that would go to waste. the first time i used it i bought a family size pizza for 3 euros. to my surprise it was reasonably fresh and tasty.	125	32667	brlti4	eofhhde

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"usually people hate reposts, but i *love* whenever this question pops up. i always love seeing what new apps i should check out, because i never browse the app store unless i know exactly what i'm looking for. there's just way too much crap, and i'm always finding apps i never knew i'd want. anyways, i like ""reddit is fun"". night sky helps you find constellations and planets in the real night sky using your phone's location and gyroscope. transit is an app that gives real-time data on busses and other public transportation services (including gps locations of the vehicles!). i used it in canada in a few cities in my province, it might work elsewhere. sleep for android can monitor your sleep and use that info to give you an alarm within a certain range of time to prevent you from feeling groggy. it also has many alarm features that are great if you have trouble waking up (and it doesn't require sleep tracking). you can set it so you have to scan a barcode or qr code (i had a shampoo bottle and a hot sauce bottle's barcodes registered) so you actually have to leave bed, for example! neat stuff. those are mine. hopefully they aren't outdated by now!"	215	32667	brlti4	eofpsea

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	profiler - gives a bunch of useful system information (cpu/gpu usage, clocks, temps etc.) and has a really good overlay so you can see how much resources apps use in real-time. google authenticator - 2fa code app, used by reddit. for real, use it. blokada - the single best ad blocker for non-rooted devices. it acts as a vpn to block hosts without root access. if you're rooted, use adaway since it modifies the hosts file directly. obviously both aren't available on the play store. naptime - an alternative to greenify, created by francisco franco (developer of francokernel). works better than greenify in my experience. accubattery - gives a lot of stats on your battery. my favorite is the estimated real capacity of the battery. sd maid - super simple space cleaner, can scan the whole device and sort stuff by size (kinda like windirstat on pc). movie mate/series mate - my favorite clients for trakt, which tracks the movies and shows you've watched. fasthub - really good github client. teamviewer - yes, it's on android and you can access your pc remotely with your phone.	50	32667	brlti4	eofpyzr

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"if you have an iphone, there's an app on it called ""measure"", which uses your camera and you can select two points and measure the distance between the two, pretty nifty. &#x200b; edit: since people are asking, it is very particular, like if you try to measure something from a distance, it most likely won't be extremely accurate. to get an accurate measurement, i've found you have to drag your phone along the length of what you're trying to measure rather than simply pointing your camera from point a to point b. so it has its limitations but if you do the first method i find it works rather well, but yeah disclaimer."	920	32667	brlti4	eofaj9s
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	two apps i recommend: water time pal - reminds me throughout the day to drink water and tells me what i should be taking in. i have it set for 2400ml and i get a notification every 2 hours. google rewards - take surveys that last maybe 10 second and earn a dime to 0.80 cents. you get maybe two surveys a month, but it can add up. after three years i've maybe earned $55.00. it's got me three or four games, micro-transactions, e-books, and audiobooks. just don't lie on the surveys. they know.	563	32667	brlti4	eofiami

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	the only app i've ever paid money for is down dog. it's an app for yoga and it has a free version, but it often runs specials for the paid version and i paid $20 for the whole year. it lets you choose your fitness level (intro to advanced), how long you want to do yoga, and what style yoga (flow, restorative, hatha, etc). the paid version lets you add a 'boost', such as 'hamstring opener' which will incorporate more hamstring stretches into the practice. and you can change the voice (male/female, american/british/new zealand). the app puts together a practice based on all the things you chose and it gives you audio instructions and a video. it also plays music in the background. and once you get better you can change the audio cues to 'minimal' or i think there's an option for 'name of pose only'.	25	32667	brlti4	eofjkx8
reddit, what are some underrated apps?	this might be more useful to canadians, but i really love the great trail app. for anyone who doesnt know, canada has a biking/hiking trail that runs right across the country from sea to sea. it sometimes follows highways, sometimes follows railways, and has lots of side trails in some areas. i love hiking and i also do long distance biking, and this app breaks the great trail down into sections, and gives you information about features and rules of that particular section (ie some are allowed motor traffic, some are horse friendly, etc), and campsites along the trail as well. its nothing fancy but it works flawlessly and has helped me to plan future bike and hike trips that im very excited about.	50	32667	brlti4	eoffhvs

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"for android: tasker: bit of a learning curve but it allows for full automation of your phone and everything and anything you do on it. it can be something simple to giving your phone the ability to shake to turn on the flash light to turning on your computer when you get home. the creator was an amazing dev and has handed off the project to somehow an even better and more passionate one. family link: i have young kids, but this is great for kids up to 13. family link helps guide you to create and manage ""kid"" google accounts. at 13 years old there is a ""graduation"" where the child and parent(s) decide if they can move to a full app. for all intents and purposes its a normal google app but allows the parents to control the associated devices via a helpful app. every thing from screen time to location to apps installed etc. for younger kids its a great way to manage tablets, for older ones its a great way to give them their privacy but make sure their screen usage stays appropriate."	51	32667	brlti4	eofn0xy

reddit, what are some underrated apps?	"annoyed phone guy here. seeing some bad advice. not sure if ignorance or malice. i'm not gonna call anyone out, though. first big problem i see. subscription apps. this is a big problem on ios, but it's coming to android, too. so what happens is, you have an app that should be free or a one-time payment, but it's a monthly subscription. as in, you will pay that amount every single month as long as you have the app. a lot of weather apps are doing it, even ones that charge you up front. they get the data from public sources, too. these predatory apps are a dime a dozen and they really only exist to rip off stupid people. obviously some subscriptions are justified, like netflix, hulu, spotify, things that are providing constantly updated content. but a weather app, or a shopping list. you don't need to keep paying for that. free is good, paid is fine, subscription is a scam. i have an iphone, and i'll post the best underrated apps i have that i use. with both android and ios, there are usually a bunch of apps competing for the same spot on your phone. the difference between a phone guy and a casual user is one who looked at all the options and found the best (not always the same answer, since we're all different) and the other who just got the first thing they found and made it work, for better or worse. most of these are free, and most are on both major mobile platforms. i'll let you know if they're not. ourgroceries: shopping list. been using it for almost 10 years now. it's on ios, it's on android, and it's on the web. totally free to use, but it has a banner ad. $5 to get rid of it. worth paying on android. if you have an iphone, you should know the developer doesn't care about apple at all. we don't get any of the good features. it's pretty bare-bones. still worth paying if you want that extra quarter inch, but absolutely not necessary. ishows tv: tracks tv shows through trakt.tv. this is ios only. trakt.tv is a website you can use on your desktop (or mobile) browser. on android, seriesguide is the way to go, and it's free. ishows costs $2 or $3. basically, you add the shows you watch, and as you watch them, you mark them as seen and you can rate them out of 10 (five stars but you can do half stars). if the show is ongoing, it will show how many days until the next episode, but if you're behind, it'll show how many aired episodes you haven't seen yet. for anyone who watches a lot of shows, this is good stuff. bing: laugh it up. it's not google. on mobile, it's better. i've checked it out on android, too, and it's just as legit there. microsoft threw everything but the kitchen sink at their app. private searching is front and center if you want to be anonymous. it has maps, weather, news, all kinds of stuff. and the best part of all? while the google app will quite literally tunnel around your ad blocker, if you have one, to get ads onto your phone, bing. includes. an ad. blocker. yes, it has adblock plus built right in. abp is the controversial one with ""acceptable ads"" which means ad providers can pay to bypass it, but this feature can be disabled to make abp a decent ad blocker. look, if you need help with games, ever, you know wikia is a festering shithole of ads. bing your game stuff, you'll see the difference it makes. abp has to be turned on first, though, as it's off by default, though once it sees so many ads, it will tell you about it. google keep: a few people mentioned this already, but it's worth repeating. best notes app ever. once you do categories and sharing, it gets so much better. apollo: best reddit client on ios, and it's not even close. when i used android, i used sync and baconreader. bacon's on ios, too, but it's a different app made by a different team at the same company. there are a ton of reddit clients for both platforms, and most of them are made by redditors who want to make reddit better, so. most of them are somebody's favorite. i just try different reddit clients and find things that they don't do that apollo does. apollo matches my flow. maybe you use reddit differently. in any case, it's worth trying different ones, and it's worth paying for a few different ones. i prefer apollo, but i want to see others thrive, too, because that encourages everyone to do their best. google photos: i saw this mentioned once as ""free backup."" it's more than that. all photos 16mp or less will be backed up for free. above 16mp, you get to make a choice. downsample to 16mp or use your google drive storage (15gb free, with paid plans for more). no iphone has had more than 12mp to date. some android phones have gone over 16, though. my wife's last phone was 20 or 24, i forget which. 16mp is fine, though, and if your camera is less. i always hear about people who lost precious photos. this doesn't have to be a problem. and it's a solution that is free to solve. and there's much more to google photos. scanner mini: someone mentioned camscanner, which has issues, and they were brought to the poster's attention, i suppose, given their edit. the truth is, you shouldn't pay for scanning. google, microsoft, and apple all do it for free. google's is photo scanner. microsoft's is office lens. and apple's is built into notes. i use readdle's scanner mini. it works with documents, their file manager. there is a pro version but i don't need it. documents: almost forgot this because it's on my dock and i'm going by homepage. documents is an ios file manager and cloud manager that plays media and reads documents. it also lets me turn my phone into a wifi drive and share everything with anyone on the same wifi network. i have yet to meet a good android file manager that does that. let me be clear, if we're on the same network, i can take your android phone, open chrome, browse to an address (docsfiletransfer dot com), this will give you a barcode, my iphone scans it, and now your android phone is browsing my iphone, and you can download any file i have on it. if you have an iphone, it's easier, my documents will detect your documents and they auto pair and i can send the file right on over. for android, solid is the file manager of choice. but it doesn't do the wifi drive. there are apps out there that do, but since i don't use android as my personal phone, i haven't really looked into it. movies anywhere: more of a service, but it's also an app. it's disney's movie streaming service, but it has a poorly kept secret. if you connect another streaming service to it, like itunes, it will give you free itunes copies of everything in ma and free ma copies of everything in itunes. well, limited to certain studios, and movies only, not tv, music, books, anime, any of that stuff. there are like 7 services it supports, and if you connect more than a couple, they even give you free movies, and they go to all services. i'll tell you two reasons why this is awesome. one, if one service goes under, your movies still exist on all the rest. two, itunes has good sales and whatever, but you can only really watch its movies on apple devices. if you switched from iphone to android, apple sort of holds those movies hostage. connect ma and google, and now you can watch itunes movies on youtube. yeah. that's huge. youtube is on everything. so is vudu, but youtube is probably something you use more. waze: social maps. shows things like speed traps, and debris on the road. contingent upon people actually reporting these things, and you can report them yourself. pretty nice map app, too, though google maps reigns supreme here. (google owns waze.) chrome remote desktop/anydesk: you know what's cool? running windows on your phone. you can't actually run windows 10 on an iphone, or an android phone for that matter, but if you have chrome remote desktop on your computer, you can access it right from your phone, whether you're in the same room or on the other side of the planet. the possibilities are endless. anydesk has more options, but isn't quite as smooth. but anydesk lets you control an android phone from the computer or an iphone, as long as the app is running (but not the other way around, ios is the only platform that cannot host). so yeah, android on an iphone. this isn't for practical use, it's for helping someone. so if you were having problems with your android phone, you could give me your desk number, and i could take over your phone, over the internet, from my iphone, and use it like i was holding it. there is some input lag, and if you didn't like what i was doing, you could kick me off. good for people with older parents. chrome remote desktop can only host on pc. i prefer crd for taking control of my pc with my phone, but anydesk has uses as well. google opinion rewards: mentioned before, but they didn't mention it's for ios, too. and the ios version pays out, every $2 earned, to paypal. that's because paypal can be used for app store/itunes purchases, but, unlike android users, ios users can cash out their opinion rewards money. also, being an iphone user means your opinion is worth more. that's not my opinion. that's google, giving me fewer surveys than my wife when we both had android (women get more surveys) and now me getting more surveys with an iphone. if *she* got an iphone, her surveys would go way up. opener: this is ios only, because it addresses a problem that android never had. so on android, if you have two or more of the same app, android will ask you which app you want to use. makes sense, right? apparently, apple never figured out how to do that. and it's a damn shame. some apps can choose the app they want to call, but there's no system-wide setting. so something that would open in the app you don't want it to, share it to opener, and opener will do what android does, offer you the choice and let you set it. android expats using ios will enjoy this greatly. edit: broke reddit's limit! one more in the replies."	16	32667	brlti4	eohr7ye

what is a mildly disturbing fact?	prions. when proteins in your body misfold, they create prions, which then infect neighbouring proteins causing them to misfold, creating a chain reaction and eventually eating *holes in your brain*. all known prion diseases are fatal. they can kill you in a bunch of fun ways, including taking away your ability to sleep or your ability to chew and swallow. they're also extremely contagious, and since they're not a virus, non-killable. and to top it all off, symptoms can take years to appear. so you can be infected with prions in your system right now and not know it.	5863	37536	bkseqj	emj9pcu

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	gel pens. when i was in primary school there was this weird trend where all the girls would suck on the ends of gel pens so their tongues turned into different colours. they would trade pens with each other in the school bathrooms and sneak away from the teachers and go to hidden parts of the school yard so they didn't get caught, it was the closest i can think of comparing to a drug ring but imagine it with 7 year old girls. one of my friends was really popular because she was the girl who sucked on the most pens and would get caught in literally every class sucking on a different gel pen, and the teachers would always have to walk her out to the nurse as she'd make herself sick and throw up. they eventually banned them. i tried it once and spat it out immediately because it was nasty and tasted like ink (duh). i didn't get it then and i still don't get it now.	2098	30742	bugoyw	epcsiqa

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	in elementary school my class was divided in two groups: penguins and rats. we would always go to our group for team assignments, for games, for anything really. somehow an actual rivalry started to sprout until the whole school was divided in these two groups, with first and second years getting into actual fights and stuff. pretty soon the principal cancelled recess for a day and went to each classroom to tell us penguin team and rat team were banned. others did create some smaller animal named groups after that but they all dissolved pretty quickly.	4109	30742	bugoyw	epcpnbs

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	rubber bands kids weren't even using them to shoot at other kids or otherwise misbehave with them. kids would buy packs of rubber bands, tie the rubber bands together, making like a big rubber band chain. it became a contest to see who could get a chain of rubber bands to stretch the farthest. you couldn't find a pack of rubber bands at a store for probably 20 miles (this was when i lived in a small town, so there wasn't a ton of stores in that 20 miles.amazon or even public internet access didn't exist yet) one kid got so many rubber bands, they could stretch it the length of the school building. while stupid, i didn't think it was a bad hobby as kids weren't shooting them or shooting stuff with them. it was all about how big of a chain they could make. school rewarded our pointless creativity with a ban on rubber bands at the school. all rubber band chains were confiscated on site.	8309	30742	bugoyw	epbyzo2

"rubber bracelets here in brazil. it became popular out of nowhere and everybody was wearing them. people even ""competed"" to see who had more bands on their arms lol until one day, some magazine showed that those bracelets were used in other countries like a ""sex challenge"", each color had a meaning and if someone breaks your band, you had to do to that person what the color means, like pink was french kiss, purple was a handjob. something like that. the schools and the parents got crazy and got rid of all those bracelets until they finally disappeared forever. actually, there wasn't a single person who used those bracelets for that reason lol, they were just cool and pretty cheap. we believe now that it was a huge hoax but it was such a long time ago that it got forgotten and nobody cared to see if it was true or not."	388	30742	bugoyw	epcr72w

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	two years ago, my principal banned slime. i'm a teacher. i was stockpiling all my confiscated slime, to create the ultimate teacher slime video, but then the principal updated the rule, and said that all slime was to be thrown away on sight, so i threw it away. the stuff is oddly satisfying, and i get why the kids loved it so much. it's also not that helpful during class.	815	30742	bugoyw	epcj0zt

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	"i come from one of those all-girl private schools that disallowed anything remotely fun, non-academic, harmful or non-beneficial to our, that is, the students' and or the school's future. no slap bracelets, no rubber sticky animal toys, no phones in use without a teacher's permission, no outside of the box foods at the cafeteria and so on. anyway, one day, a girl in my year group, known to be ""rebellious"" and ""untamed"" by the teachers, (sweet and fun girl that took none of the school's nonsense), decided that we should rally together and develop a way to rebel in way that was both noticeable by teachers and not harmful to our futures. (we could be suspended or expelled.) and that we should do it on an important day. luckily, important guests visited our school often and the next visit was the following week. it happened to be the founder of the school. we read through the rule book for any loopholes we could've exploited. that's when i noticed that the student handbook that the wardens, teacher's, treated like a bible for ""uniform etiquette,"" said nothing of where a student was to wear their ties. (our uniforms consisted of a blouse, a navy blue skirt and a tie along with the school badge and whatever pins that aligned itself with school activities, such as house badges, student council badges etc.) the girl decided we would use this rule to ""host a revolution that wouldn't stop until, at least, some of the 'unreasonable' restrictions were lifted."" so on school's founder's visiting day, at least 90% of the student body started wearing their ties in ridiculous places. like some tied it around their waist, some tied them around their heads, some tied it around their arm, some of them used them as hair ties, the list goes on. needless to say, it made the teachers furious and embarrassed, however, the founder found the entire situation ""very funny, appreciated our respect for the school"" and praised us for our ""united front."" the ""red and gold rebellion"" was successful in more ways than one. (the ties were red, gold and black.) not only did we get our restrictions lifted, but we also became closer to the founder and was given access speak to him if more trouble arose, the teachers grew to appreciate the many more aspects of life and the entire student body became more like a family. anyway, after that, they refined their student handbook and specified where to wear your ties and more. they really disallowed rebellion through uniform loopholes after that, which i found hilarious. tl;dr: student body had enough with the heavy rules and restrictions, used a loophole through uniforms rules to revolt and got any uniform loophole exploitation banned."	113	30742	bugoyw	epdt619

what became so popular at your school that the teachers had to ban it?	my friends and i played this game where, if one of us was taking a dump, we had to text our group as soon as we'd left class. everyone else in the group would then ask to 'go to the bathroom' (or just walk out of the class), but would be leaving class to search the entire school for the pooper's poop place. we kept score (of course). if you could finished pooping in time, or if you were the first to find and send a photo of the pooper mid-poop you were awarded points. the teachers started getting suspicious when everyone all of a sudden had to shit at the same time and/or they'd see like 10 guys running around frantically searching every bathroom on campus. simultaneously, the game was growing in both popularity and notoriety, and eventually someone spilt the beans under pressure. punishment? no one in the senior class could use the bathroom. like 20 of us got the got the bathroom banned, for \~300 people. did it last long? no, of course not, because it was a stupid fucking response made by some strangely draconian teachers/admins. everyone's parents immediately complained. some of the teachers were livid and tried to make more of a fuss (others thought it was hilarious), but the school dropped the bathroom ban because you can't ban that. however, we were warned if we got caught playing we'd be suspended. so, ya, we got trying to catch each other taking shits during class banned. 10/10 would recommend, was super fun.	78	30742	bugoyw	epdt42u

"pretty sure these were called click-clacks. i don't think they ever actually got banned, although you can't even get them now because ""not safe."" it was two solid, heavy balls connected by a string. you held the string in the middle and moved your hand up and down, making the balls hit each other above your hand and below your hand repeatedly for as long as you could until you missed. it took a lot of skill to do this and was really fun. the problem was, when you missed, the balls would slam into the inside of your forearms and leave major bruises. they tried to make a comeback some years ago, but the new, safe version used straight sticks of plastic, so the balls always connected. it was basically just a noise maker. no skill involved at all. what's the fun in that?"	32	30742	bugoyw	epcgi9c

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	"not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the us in the depression. it was called the civilian conservation corps. participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country. the reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the dust bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the us was not a bottomless well of natural resources. (erosion was a big cause of the dust bowl, and the dust bowl was a factor in the depression, so it all tied together.) they were also called ""roosevelt's tree army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control. in my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture. you can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive. (i'm actually going to stay in one next week.) some of them have photos from the ccc days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on. i'd definitely support a program like that today, but i think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it. plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated. with the ccc, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out. it would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start. edit: a number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins i mentioned. the ones i'm familiar with are in pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/. not all cabins are ccc-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details. (there's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about ccc's role in the park.) rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a pennsylvania resident. the system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly. some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ada-accessible unit. other states and some national parks also have ccc-built cabins available for rental, but as far as i know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are."	25495	80513	bn3bpz	en27b8v

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	i don't support forced service of any kind. the purpose of the state is to protect its citizens from foreign powers and provide infrastructure and services that private corporations can't provide. as citizens have a collective interest in these things, it makes sense that said citizens should pay their fair share and that these taxes would then fund a professional military which compensates citizens enough to maintain a fighting force without a draft or any forced service. the same goes for environmental services in my opinion. i'm ok with paying a tax if that money is put to work effectively.	574	80513	bn3bpz	en276bu
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no. some of us need to earn a living. who's going to pay our rent etc while we're doing this? will we lose our houses/apartments if we're not earning money for months on end and can't pay rent? also, however worthy the cause, forced labour is still slavery, and therefore completely immoral. better to convince people to care enough to volunteer to help out in their free time, or pass legislation forcing companies to stop using plastic, etc. by forcing people to do this against their will, you will turn them off the cause and make them less likely to care for the planet, recycle, etc in the long run.	1619	80513	bn3bpz	en239dq

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	so the old people who ruined the environment can force the young people to clean it up? idiotic idea. edit: maybe remember ops topic before commenting - post is about a mandatory program to fix things not an argument if things need fixing or not. guess it could also be said that a mandatory service program is drafting the public into cleaning up after corporations that made a fortune exploiting the earth, once again letting the responsible party sit back and do nothing to fix wha they broke. a volunteer cleanup just helps politicians and corporations shift the blame towards 'personal responsibility' and away from themselves. picking up litter and planting trees wont save the world. but voting might.	285	80513	bn3bpz	en2a4k8
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	mandatory? no, especially not based on a military design where the government can dictate where you move and serve. incentivized? for sure. a coordinated environmental task force jobs program along these lines, built for for young and/or underemployed people, would be awesome. i'm not confident this would fix our global environmental issues without being accompanied by a serious effort on behalf of the corporate world to reduce pollution waste. but it won't hurt, and it's a good way to get people involved in conservation at an early age.	58	80513	bn3bpz	en2efyz

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no. for the same reason i don't believe in the draft. when it comes to war if your people don't want to fight they shouldn't have to. rich people throwing the bodies of other people at problems they create are ridiculous. if massive corporations weren't fucking up the planet you wouldn't even have to be asking this question, and me being forced to involuntarily clean up their mess wouldn't be an issue. &#x200b; why in the hell should i be forced to clean up the ocean while the people that did it are drinking scotch on a yacht watching me?	7	80513	bn3bpz	en491u7

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no, because i don't think transporting millions of young people out of cities, towns and rural areas to these destinations and forcing them to work will be helpful. i get that they need to be made conscious of environmental issues, but i just don't think it would be effective (as in actually helping to get the work done). they could only do work that they wouldn't need a qualification or any special skills for, it would be a massive safety issue (making sure they don't drown cleaning the ocean or get injured planting trees) and it would cost massive amounts of money to pay, house and feed them all. i generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. it would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects.	69	80513	bn3bpz	en249xr

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	not mandatory. i have a baby on the way and would not be chill at all with the government forcing me to be seperated from him. also i dont think it would foster a very productive work environment for those involved. most people would be mad to be forced and so would have poor work ethic and it would actually make people care about and want to help the environment less. then theres the question of if it would be paid. if its not, you have people losing homes, credit getting ruined, and whole livelyhoods being destroyed. if it is paid, you still have the problem of how some of those people would pay their bills. for most that would be fairly simple (assuming theyre always able to access the internet, which is unlikely), but some people have bills that are still accepting payment in the stone age, as in they expect them to mail or hand deliver the payment (for example: discount motors near where i live). and frankly, im completely against the government making any action mandatory.	4	80513	bn3bpz	en3e1gu

would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	that would be another pointless feel-good exercise that shifts responsibility further from the people that are actually fucking the planet. the only environmentalism that has any significant effect is increased industry regulation	3	80513	bn3bpz	en46zmv
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	no. any form of draft results in a huge waste of time, specially for students, and they pay next to nothing. you can pay people to do it instead.	3	80513	bn3bpz	en4ankj
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	not mandatory, but as a job that people can have, paid by taxes like the police and such.	3	80513	bn3bpz	en4ndy0
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	absolutely, at least for anyone receiving unemployment benefits. i was at a loose end when i was 19 and did a program set up in australia that was geared towards skilling up people my age by doing a 6 month, hands on conservation program. it was great, taught me things id never have learned otherwise, like how to use a chainsaw, weed management, what native tree to plant where, etc. lots of young guys did the program, i could see it benefiting them, especially the guys that had left school early and hadnt really had the option (or hadnt chosen) to go into a trade or to uni. good stuff. but mandatory? perhaps not	3	80513	bn3bpz	epje1uc
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	maybe not mandatory, but more opportunities for young people (like myself) to help the environment. the youth strikes have convinced many to do things to help the environment (use less plastic, go vegan, buy secondhand etc) but there's not many initiatives for teens and young adults to meet and do environmental services. even things like community gardens and beach cleanup teams could bring people together and help stop climate change. we all need to be supporting greta thunberg - and all of the people fighting for our planet - in making a difference.	3	80513	bn3bpz	epjm4dz
would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? why or why not ?	never. america has fought and bled for freedom. freedom is the reason for america. it's the ideal that bring's us together. when you take that freedom away, even if it's to defend freedom such as in a draft, you're spitting in the face of liberty.	66	80513	bn3bpz	en2cfzw

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	had a friend become impatient with mushrooms once. he took an eighth, and an hour later decided they werent very strong, so the most logical thing to do would be eat his other eighth. cut to 2 hours later, and he is parked on top of a parking garage. tried to drive across town when they kicked in and he immediately realized his fuck up. he tried to wait it out, but after being abandoned by everyone else (i wasnt around, no way in hell would i have left the poor guy on 7 grams of shrooms to his own devices) and he decides he needs help. so he calls 911. while on the phone he wants to be as honest as possible, so he tells them about his .22 caliber rifle behind the seat of his truck. only it comes out as,theres a gun in the car. he says he was tripping and sweating so badly (it was july) the next thing he remembers is hearing a *tink tink tink* and looking up to being surrounded by police, guns drawn and ready for anything. friend isnt a danger though, so they get him in an ambulance, and give him charcoal to induce vomiting. the rest of the night is a blur for him, and he wakes up cuffed to the bed. they ask him if theres anyone he can call for a ride, and he tells them his mom is a nurse who works on the second floor. apparently while tripping he kept telling them to go upstairs and get mom, so they all have a chuckle realizing his mom really was upstairs.	12940	44698	bmhq67	emx0pqq

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	i had a guy who was freaking out thinking he was going to die because he thought he had eaten too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. he went online and saw that sometimes patients are given activated charcoal to soak up the mushrooms in the stomach (not entirely true btw). so he goes outside and starts chowing down on charcoal briquettes that he has in his garage for grilling! after about a dozen he realizes holy shit im eating charcoal briquettes. now he is really freaking out so he grabs his dog (as the thinks he is never coming back to his house) and drives himself to the ed. he parks out front, walks into triage with the pup (black charcoal all over his face and hands) and says i need a doctor and someone to watch my dog when i die!	25529	44698	bmhq67	emwzguk

"i'm a paramedic but this story is from back when i was an emt (hand-holder, oxygen-giver, bandage distributor). got called at night for a teenage male who had ""ingested mushrooms."" on the way to the call, my paramedic partner was unusually silent. after a while she pipes up, ""i don't get it. he ate mushrooms. like, what.portabellas??"" she grew up very sheltered in the country. so that's how this was gonna go. we get there and the cops walk out a skinny kid wearing only boxers. took some shrooms, first time ever, freaked out and told his parents who called 911. my partner is spinning in circles and asking whether she should call poison control. i help the kid into the ambulance and onto the stretcher, turn the lights down low and tell my partner just to drive to the hospital. the kid is calming down a bit but he's tripping pretty hard. asking if his parents are jesus and stuff like that. this was before smart phones when ipods were the shit. i had one of those radio transmitters you could plug into the ipod and then play music through the vehicle speakers. it had a remote that i carried on my belt along with the clicker for the ambulance. we were going to the hospital, lights down low, just being chill when i remembered what my partner and i had been listening to a couple hours before when we checked our equipment. [thievery corporation.](https://youtu.be/un9tulbhr8y) so i reached down and hit the remote without him noticing. a few seconds go by and he turns to me with the widest eyes i've ever seen. ""whoa. what. is. this. music?"" he was in true bliss. he kept asking me about the music for the rest of the ride. we dropped him off and i wrote ""listen to thievery corporation"" on a sheet of paper and tucked it into the waistband of his boxers. i like to think there's some dude out there from upstate new york who fell in love with thievery in high school but doesn't really know why. edit: yeah!! thanks guys for my first gold/silver after being on here for years. it's also my birthday and you guys just made a ho-hum day great! this happened 13 years ago and i've had many great experiences in my career, but this is still one of my favorite ems stories. i'm happy you all enjoyed it. for those of you new to thievery, glad you found them! also check out cosmic game, radio retaliation and culture of fear. they span so many genres but always bring a great vibe. and their message is pretty on point. one of the few bands i almost never skip."	5767	44698	bmhq67	emx337o

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	"i was a doctor that was on rotation in the emergency department. 33 year old male who was brought in naked by the police, under the influence of suspected mushroom ingestion. he had a bit of trouble understanding why hed been arrested, despite being very aware of the fact that hed been caught galavanting around naked in the rain in a childrens playground. the initial police response had been with two officers, and he told me with glee that they werent able to grab him because he was slippery like an oiled pig in the rain, and the nakedness didnt help with no clothing for them to grab. due to being unable to catch him, they called for dog-squad backup. he recounted with a shit-eating grin how hed hidden inside a giant puddle like rambo and had thrown sticks and rocks to confuse the police dog. following an hour or so, they gave up and reverted to using a search line of ~12 police slowly advancing to find him. eventually one stumbled into this goblins little swamp puddle, and then they took another 15 minutes trying to catch him as he bolted naked around the childrens playground.again. his only regret, despite his wife refusing to come and pick him up from the hospital, was that he hadnt eaten more shrooms. edit: im glad this story is brightening a few days. thank you for the silvers and golds! to his fans: im sure hes somewhere out there to this very day.naked, slippery, and plotting his revenge. edit 2: it's a big no-no, i know-know, but i couldn't resist. i remembered that i took a screenshot of his ""presenting complaint"" when he came into the ed - i needed something to show my future children. don't worry, all identifiable information has safely been removed [slippery, naked silliness](https://i.imgur.com/haxtpeo.jpg). also, fixed the dr who - a lot of concerned bbc fans out there."	8632	44698	bmhq67	emx2rj5
in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	er physician here. i see complications of drug abuse daily. that said, er visits from hallucinogens are very rare. not counting some bad reactions to pcp and ketamine, which are more dissociative agents than hallucinogens, i have probably only seen a handful of cases in my entire career. i wish i could say the same for alcohol, which contributes to multiple injuries every shift i work. most of the time it is pretty boring. usually the patient was either naive to the drug or took a bit too much and has some anxiety. a few cases of teenagers being caught tripping by their parents and dragged to the hospital, which seems like a terrible experience. now, what i am seeing is an increase in senior citizens having bad reactions to marijuana edibles. basically someone in their retirement community gets a medical marijuana card, and they all decide to try edibles for the first time, only to find out this isnt the weed they were smoking in the 60s. not really a hallucinogen, but one time i was using propofol to sedate a patient for a procedure. he thought he was lionel from thindercats, and was doing the thunder. thunder. thundercats. ho! thing the whole time. it was hysterical. outside of work, one of my friends ate a bag of shrooms at a party, and got stuck in a loop talking about the camel from the cigarette brand. he was convinced the camel was coming to the party. another friend tried to go surfing one night while on shrooms. issue was he forgot to put clothes on. yep, guy was walking down the road at 2am, butt naked, with nothing but a surfboard. so while i cannot give my endorsement for drugs. hallucinogens (assuming untainted product, in reasonable doses, in a safe setting) tend to be fairly safe compared to other drugs of abuse that i see regularly. now i am sure people have done dumb/dangerous shit while on them, but it seems low compared to other substances some of which are legal. edit - i apologize everyone. i get it - his name is lion-o. i guess i am a little out of date on my thundercats trivia.	2785	44698	bmhq67	emx11u7

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	physician here. i have not seen anyone on mushrooms (at least not that i knew of) in the hospital. the drug testing for them is actually relatively difficult and not standardized (or at least it wasn't when i was training). i have seen people whacked out of their minds on pcp. we had a patient strapped down to a bed in four point restraints. this was actually pretty common with some of the violently psychotic patients in philadelphia where i trained. i watched the guy somehow shake the bed to the point where he was able to stand up and waddled forward still attached to the bed in his restraints. as a medical student at the time, i just go out of there and let the professionals work that case. patients on pcp will shatter glass, break bones, etc and feel nothing until they come down. i have also seen a patient with lesch-nyhan syndrome. these patients will disturb you. lesch-nyhan is an enzyme disorder which culminates in extreme neurologic symptoms. these patients are classically known to self-mutilate, gouge their own eyes out, etc. the patient i briefly came into contact with would attempt to bite anyone the moment they walked by or got too close. it was super disturbing because it was completely without malice. this patient was also in four point restraints.	2314	44698	bmhq67	emwxeqy
in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	okay, so not a doctor and not exactly a great story but stay far, far away from k2/spice/any other kind of synthetic ~~marijuana~~ cannabinoids. i work in the mental health field and nearly all of the staff here agree that they have never seen worse episodes of psychosis than some of the ones they've seen after people take k2 (and these are people who've seen it all: opioids, cocaine, crack, pcp, you name it). stuff like violently throwing their entire body into a wall over and over and over. one person woke up in a psych hospital and couldn't remember anything that happened after smoking k2. they told her she'd stripped naked and was pouring milk on herself in the middle of a very busy street and she was absolutely horrified, mostly because she couldn't remember any of it. people legit trying to eat themselves. seizures and cardiac arrest. the kind of stuff that i would call absurd and unrealistic if it was in a movie. there are hundreds and hundreds of different chemical compounds they can use to make that stuff and they are constantly changing it to avoid it being detectable in drug tests or to skirt laws. because it's not regulated, you literally have no way of knowing what you're actually smoking when you get that shit, but you can almost be guaranteed that whatever it is will fuck up your brain and not in a good way. edit: this post started getting up higher than i thought it would, so i want to add some good information people left in the comments below. u/probablyboobs: adding to that; it's not called synthetic cannabinoid because it has any structural similarities to cannabis (which is not dangerous), but because it interacts with the body's endogen cannabinoid system. in whatever way. that's literally the only similarity, it can affect your body in many different ways and it is dangerous. not comparable with marihuana. u/pounce-a-lot: not only is the psychosis severe, but long lasting. i saw clients who were very young with no psychiatric history, and now they have psychosis that isnt responding to medication because of heavy spice usage. its a terrible drug. \[and i just want to add that the people i work with have also told me the exact same thing.\]	676	44698	bmhq67	emx5itm

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	i waited tables and bartended in college. i lived in a giant apartment with like 8 other guys. it wasnt too uncommon for me to get home to a full on keg party happening in our basement and kitchen and roof. most of the time, the guys would text me and say hey man, were getting some kegs, you cool with that? and id say yeah and wed continue on. one night i got a different text. hey man, cool if we get some kegs and have people over? oh and were all about to take shrooms me: wait wait if youre taking shrooms then dont have anyone over thats a bad idea, also maybe could you wait for me please? them: ahhh actually man we already got the kegs and we took the shrooms 10 minutes ago, we just wanted to give you the heads up. excellent. three hours later i get home. i open the door, and 3 roommates are standing on the stairs, staring intently at a stain on the wall. one throws his coffee cup at it and they all scatter, screaming about how the walls were breathing. roommate 4 is in the kitchen with a group of people. they are silent. then i see a knife sail through the crowd and enter an unseen wall to the left. i hear cheering. roommate number 4 is wearing only boxers. he also smeared shampoo on the kitchen walls, like up near the ceiling, so he would have had to stand on chairs/tables to get that high. roommates 5 and 6 got into a fist fight over the proposed mosque being built close to the site of the twin towers in nyc. roommate 5 had a large gash in his hand from punching straight through roommate 6s beer stein. roommate 6 was searching roommate 5s room for cash to replace his beer stein while roommate 5 attempted to superglue his hand back together. they did not make amends and were still arguing, except about aliens now and how an alien mosque would still not be okay. roommate 7 got into a fight and broke up with his long time girlfriend over tripping balls on shrooms, and he was now having vigorous sex with a random girl on our basement couch. hes now married to ex long time girlfriend and they have two kids. roommate number 8 was smoking weed with friends upstairs. also, there was cocaine. cocaine that no one saw, or remembered bringing. cocaine that was still on the coffee table that the cops somehow didnt see when they came about a noise complaint. cocaine that we found three days later just sitting on the coffee table and everyone collectively shit a brick. roommates 1, 2, and 3 that had scattered upon my entry were now searching all 4 levels of our apartment for a man they called lance. no one knows a lance, no one found lance, but everyone insisted that at one point during the night there was a lance and he brought his own shrooms which he also shared with everyone. roommate 4 joins in, still carrying knives. we later narrowed lance down to a guy that showed up with his little sister, their parents, and a realtor looking to show the apartment to potentially rent to the sister when we all moved out (this was a common occurrence). they walked in to 8 dudes who had just tapped a keg and were just starting to trip. lance stayed behind, but promptly disappeared. we later discovered that no realtor had actually shown anyone the place that night and that lance and his family were completely a product of tripping balls.	44	44698	bmhq67	emxm77g

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	i had a trauma patient who went to brunch, got drunk, and met a new friend who offered him some mushrooms. all his other friends advised against it and went home, but he was adamant. fast forward, and new friend is nowhere to be found and my patient had fallen off a roof and was on the way to me in an ambulance. he rolls through the doors with 15 police officers, so i ask hey, is he violent? whats up? and they said no, but we just want to see what hes going to do next. and they all laughed. he was apparently jumping from house to houses roofs and someone called 911. he refused to get down and get yelling brian and created a whole police response including the helicopter. he eventually fell between houses, (no more than a 2-story fall) landed on cactus and a recycling bin and then ran into the front yard and was apprehended by police while doing snow angels. he was definitely tripping balls when he arrived, but was directable and pretty chill. fairly uninjured too, spent a long time plucking cactus spines out of his whole body so asked him about his experience. how did he get on the roof? he climbed a telephone pole he thought was a beanstalk in mario. who was brian? apparently his brother he was looking for. why did he keep running? he thought the helicopter was an alien spaceship light beam that was after him. right before he went to his admission bed for the night he got a goofy grin on his face so i asked what was up. he said is it wrong i want to do it again? and i said yes, since he had caused a lot of expensive chaos. but if there was a next time, dont be drunk and have close friends with you. tldr; guy brunches too hard, meets a new friend who gives him mushrooms for the first time, then loses this new friend and gets transported into a mario game while searching for his brother and causes a full police helicopter response, falls off a roof and ends up in the hospital as a trauma patient with a $50k bill.	40	44698	bmhq67	emxgia8
in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	"i used to work in ""psychedelic harm reduction"" at a pretty big, and majorly wild music festival where i live and i have some absolutely bonkers stories. my favorite though is the time i met lars. lars was somewhere in his late 30s, tall, ruggedly handsome with one of those faces that just exudes character. he was dressed like an old-timey prospector and carried a huge, hand-made leather rucksack. lars had hiked in to the festival without purchasing a ticket. he walked 10 hours through uncut woods, hiked over a mountain and then swam across a river just to get there. lars had never taken psychedelics before the night i met him, so of course he thought it would be a good idea to take 4 hits of lsd. security escorted lars into the space (a large, secluded area near the center of the festival full of hammocks, tents, art supplies, snacks and a committed staff of wonderful, caring people), and from the moment he saw me, he was imprinted on me like a baby duckling. he literally didn't leave my side for the next 8 hours as i talked him off the psychedelic precipice. at one point i had to literally go into a porta-potty with him, as the thought of being without me for even one minute was too much for his fragile psyche to bear. lars was, and still is, one of the most interesting people i'd ever met. we talked a lot, and while he mostly went in circles, they were ever expanding concentric circles, and so in time i learned a little bit more about him with each cycle. he had this little hand gesture kind of like little tiny karate-chops he'd do every so often to accentuate a point, accompanied by this kind of ""tch tch tch"" sound. he was very intense, but mostly just wanted someone to see him and hear him. he really needed me to understand where he was coming from, and i was only too happy to oblige him. lars grew up in sweden, and came from a broken home. he was for a time the swedish national youth archery champion. he was also a member of sweden's version of the navy seals, though was very cagey about his time in the service. he left sweden after the death of his mother (this part was unclear, but she was possible murdered by his father) and eventually made his way to canada. in canada he lived the life of a true man of the wilds. he had an old dodge pickup he'd made a custom camper for, and he traveled around the back country, hunting and living off the land. he made literally everything he needed for his life himself. he made bows, he made clothes, he made shoes, he made pots and pans. if lars needed something, there wasn't a damn way in hell he was going to a store to buy it when he could damn well make it himself. he also had a donkey that he sometimes traveled with that seemed to be his one true friend in the world. i found out later that lars is also one of the most amazing landscape photographers i've ever seen. i won't share a link to his work as i don't want to out his real identity, but trust me, the dude's work is fucking spectacular. the way he uses color, and the scenery he finds in his wild-man travels are truly stunning. printed large format, his photographs could easily grace the walls of any high-end gallery, though of course lars thinks selling art for money is unseemly. lars and i spent near 8 hours together, him becoming a little more lucid with each passing hour. he eventually decided he was ready to take a nap in one of the hammocks and after exchanging contact details he thanked me for ""saving his life"" (i did no such thing) and fell into the blissful sleep of a man who'd done battle with his demons and come out the other side mostly intact. i saw lars in the real world a few years after our night together. we'd stayed in touch and eventually he was in the city where i live and we met for a walk. he was just as interesting as i remember, and wanted me to buy this abandoned old hotel he'd found in some small town in the middle of nowhere so he could turn it into an art gallery or something. if i'd had the money i probably would have done it. i assume him and his donkey are still somewhere out there in the wilds as i write this."	41	44698	bmhq67	emyfmvv

in honor of denvers decriminalization of magic mushrooms, doctors of reddit what, if any, is your best story of patients on hallucinogenics?	"was driving to stinson beach, north of san francisco, on a fine, sunny, summer day. stopped near sausalito to pick up these 2 hitchhikers. this was in 1968. red headed girl with green eyes and wearing a flowery dress , and her diminutive friend, a little red headed guy with fiery eyes. (her brother?). anyway every time we rounded a curve going towards mt. tamalpais, he would exclaim ""far out"" with the new panorama opening up. about halfway there this girl who was sitting in the middle of the front of my ford station wagon, (1969, 429 cubes, indian fire colored with black leather seats) reached into her purse and brought out a little dark brown cigarette. ""are you hip to this?"" she asked. ""i can dig it."" i replied. i took a couple of tokes on this little brown cigarette and suddenly the road turned into a ribbon flowing out in front of us. i was driving about 60 mph and really digging how smooth the ride was. when we reached stinson beach parking lot, the girl said ""you can drop us off here."" i said ""no, i always have to go to the end of the road."" i noticed for the first time ever a voice in my head, a deep toned masculine voice, that asked me ""**why do you always have to go to the end of the road**?"" i was alerted to something being different at that point. when they got out of the car i said ""i hope you have a nice day.""(the expression was fairly new in '69 and had been getting critiqued in the san francisco chronicle by herb caen, who didn't much like the overuse of the expression). she leaned close to my face and said ""we hope you have a nice day."" well she knew what she was talking about i guess. i went to the beach and brought my little transistor radio and my towel and lay down on the beach. i first noticed the music was coming out of my radio in circles, directly into my ears and seemed to go on forever. it sounded wonderful. witchy tai to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg9lt4qr_dw was playing and i suddenly heard the most wonderfully magical sound i had ever heard. i sat up and looked to see what was causing it. it was the sound of some car keys in the hand of someone walking by. i looked out on the ocean and noticed that the breakers were coming in like pink cotton candy. i freaked a little noticing that things weren't real at all. i worried about myself at this point because i didn't know what was in the cigarette that i only took took puffs on. i saw a cop down the beach and considered , for a moment, turning myself in to him. at this point the voice returned in my head and said **""you know what's wrong with you, dude? you don't like people.""** i decided to go the hamburger stand and get some coffee and food, thinking this would counteract whatever i had inhaled. there was a line of 8 or so people. i turned my face away from everyone in line thinking that if they could see it they would immediately know what i was experiencing. oh yeah, almost forgot, as i was walking to the refreshment stand i noticed that i was sort of floating. my feet didn't seem to be touching the ground. while i was in line i accidentally brushed up against the person standing directly in front of me. the physical sensation was like a wave washing over my body and i nearly had an orgasm. i turned to peek at who it was that felt so good, it was a big fat hairy guy standing there. i drank 3 cups of coffee and had 2 hot dogs and went back down to my towel on the beach. my radio was gone. it had been stolen. i don't actually remember how long i lay there but the effects wore off by sunset and i drove myself home. i don't know what was in the cigarette. it smelled like pot, but obviously was soaked in something else. i have asked some friends about it and they said it sounded like pcp or some really good grass. that is my only experience with any hallucinogens this lifetime. i never smoked much pot either. i was a straight up brooks brothers suit, short haircut guy working for ibm as a sales engineer. i am 82 now and living on borrowed time."	56	44698	bmhq67	emxq8n4

which propaganda effort was so successful, people still believe it today?	a lot of ones from the rise of caesar augustus/octavian. -cleoptra was a slut who became powerful only by sex appeal. contemporary and unbiased sources actually suggest she was rather plain, but it was her intellect and charming conversation that got her power. also, as far as sexual relations go, her affairs with julius caesar and antony, as well as her traditional marriages to her brothers, arent bad compared to the well-known affairs of some other figures, especially antony. defaming cleopatra made her easier to demonize and portray as a seductress ruling over antony, making war easier for octavian. -marcus lepidus was useless. in reality, though he lacked the clout or force of personality that octavian and antony wielded, he was a competent administrator and leader who played a key role in defeating sextus pompey. he was a big enough political threat that both antony and octavian wanted him gone, but couldnt just kill him (he was forced into joining the priesthood as a solution). octavian would rather just have people forget that he wasnt the only true roman option (antony being, semi-fairly, perceived as far too decadent). -sextus pompey was a barbaric pirate king who raped and plundered the mediterranean. the youngest son of pompey magnus was likely a competent ruler, given that he held sicily and sardinia against the triumvirate with no internal attempts to unseat him. he did blockade the city of rome from its grain supply to force the triumvirs to negotiate with him, but the characterization of him as a monster is unfair. -octavian being a great military leader. all evidence points to the contrary: three great victories often are attributed to him, and we shall examine them. at mutina, where pro-senate forces fought mark antony in the chaos after caesars death, octavian was a general, but was subordinate to two other men who did much of the real leadership. these two were killed in battle, however, so octavian gets the credit. at philippi, where brutus and cassius were defeated by antony and octavian, octavians forces were overrun by brutus while, a little ways away, antony destroyed cassius army. when octavians camp was overrun, he was found to not even be present; he had claimed illness the night before and stayed away from the battle. antony had to bring his own troops around to defeat brutus. and finally, actium, where antony and cleopatra were defeated not by octavian, but his more capable subordinate, marcus agrippa. agrippa was known for his engineering and architectural skill, but was also a valuable commander (he was the man who defeated sextus pompey at sea while lepidus took his territory by land). agrippa organized the fleet at actium and was the one to lead them to victory. a lot of this was instilled by augustus rather successful record destroying once he became ruler and no one having enough power to challenge him.	447	47328	bqc3ib	eo4h6nw

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	oh, i can share a good story. i had a teacher in high school who was a former lawyer. we always asked him why gave up his practice to start teaching. he finally caved and explained that his last case was the defense of three people. apparently there had been a fourth. it was two couples, who in the act of a drunken, drugged out orgy, decided to kill, partially eat, and dismember one of the women. i guess it seemed like a good idea at the time. as a lawyer, he said it was pretty open and shut, but he had to get his clients the best result possible, and he was exposed to all the horrid details, the pictures, and their reasoning. my teacher had such a far off look when he explained it that we could see it really got to him.	14214	50300	bsomsy	eopbod2

"had a divorce client, husband and father, who disowned his autistic son, tried to argue that he should get all of his wife's retirement having not worked for 12 years, contacted me during the height of hurricane sandy (he was in the bronx and me in manhattan) saying he wanted to hold his wife in contempt for not paying him that day while the storm slammed nyc, told me i was making a huge mistake getting married (my wedding date was november 3rd, 4 days after sandy) saying that i was going to be miserable and regret it. i could go on. but, the worst was when, several months later, since his divorce was taking a long time, he sent death threat letters to myself and my wife saying that he had hired an ""executor"" to kill the two of us if his divorce wasn't finalized in 60 days. called the police and they said he left his premises one day earlier. i heard nothing from him until february 2014 when he emailed me saying he needed a winter coat from his wife and could i help get it for him. ironically, the divorce didn't have to be completed because he killed himself before the judge signed the judgment of divorce. tl;dr: miserable guy who wanted to spread his misery, and crossed the line when he threatened to kill my wife. edit : for something a little lighter, this memorial day weekend reminds me of not my worst client, but definitely my dumbest. i was representing her on a child custody and child support matter. she was calling me on memorial day saying she really needed to speak to me. i called her back and asked if it was urgent since it was memorial day and all. she said: ""oh, i didn't think that jews celebrated memorial day, so i thought you were going to be available."" edit 2: because so many people have pointed it out, i have now put the word executor in quotes because that was his word and not mine. also, since people have questioned it, my user name is also the name of my firm."	7736	50300	bsomsy	eop9ka2

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i've done a lot of prison legal aid, and i could tell stories about child molesters that would turn you green, but instead i'll turn you green a different way. i had a kid (17) who was mildly cognitively disabled, due to brain trauma he sustained at the hands of his birth parents, who ended up with a really wonderful foster care family and thrived. he was a popular kid in school, good athlete, got a girlfriend and invited her to meet up and be teenagers one night in a corn silo - which i guess is a thing that country kids do? i don't know, this all comes from the pre-sentence investigation report i read before taking his case, but this girl met him at the silo and they were hanging out inside. by his account, they were having a nice time and he was really enjoying himself, then for no particular reason, he picked up a 2x4 and bashed her skull in. he then used a combination of very crude farm implements (shovels, hoes) to chop her body up and bury it in the corn and went home like nothing had happened. hey, you asked. eta: holy shit, i didn't expect to wake up to 11k in karma and 100 replies this morning, i'll try to reply to those i can. and i do appreciate the gesture of giving me reddit currency, but folks, reddit has enough money and when the firm needs more, they can go back to their venture capitalists - i would encourage you to make a donation to your local [united way](https://www.unitedway.org/#) or another reputable charity instead.	16043	50300	bsomsy	eopikoh
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	the first week i started at my current criminal defense firm i was tasked with cataloging discovery from our client's phone. the phone had multiple (talking around 4,000) videos, photos, text exchanges with women under 16 (though not all of the girls' ages were confirmed most, if not all, were under the legal age of consent and many were barely pubescent) naked and being prostituted over 1 year. he would lure these girls in exchange for drugs. nothing felt totally bizarre until i came across one video where he was clearly forcing himself upon a literal child who was so high on benzodiazepines (not willingly but rather forced) and choking her in the process. when our firm confronted him, he said he was in love with her and that's why he did it. he would also take these girls to hotels and make them have sex with one another while he taped, but nothing beat what i said above. pretty horrifying stuff for my first week on the job.	13082	50300	bsomsy	eop33i8

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	criminal defense lawyer. i can name a few instances where i was just absolutely disgusted with my client. caveat, these are mostly years ago when i was taking just any old case. i most practice white collar and federal now. 1. i won a dui case because the government messed up on something right before trial was to begin. my client gives me a hug and completely reeks of alcohol. he has driven to court. i took his keys and called his mother. 2. client who was accused of molesting a 12 year old. he was mid 40s at the time and i had to shut him down real quick when he tried to tell me how the 12 year old was coming on to him. 3. i represented a woman for a grand theft charge. left her in my office to get some things copied before she left. after she left, i realized my sunglasses and car keys were stolen. i tracked her down in the lobby and told her i was not going to represent her anymore and i would call the police if she didnt empty her pockets in front of me and give me my things 4. i had a client who was released after 25 years in prison for murder and then the same day he beats up his prospective new landlord. he ended up getting another 10 years. he was unrepentant and laughed about how he hit the guy so hard his eye ball popped out. i thought, this guy deserves to be in prison. took the case to trial anyway and (shocker) lost and he got 10 (the max). 5. client who pretended to be a doctor so he could sell steroids. according to the gov, he had numerous clients who were made to believe that his steroids would cure their cancer. they paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars and some of them died. i just thought that was pure evil.	16132	50300	bsomsy	eop46g9
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my so's mother, l, was abusive. she frequently hit her husband, was a compulsive liar, and just generally made her family miserable. when they were settling the divorce, the judge initially deemed a testimony from the kids (my so and her brother) unnecessary, probably because they were minors at the time and testifying against one of their parents would be hard on them, to say the least. however, the lawyer representing l was really insistent that they testify. well it must've been a shock to the lawyer to suddenly have two more witnesses with dozens of accounts of driving under the influence, domestic violence, ect ect. we figured l must've lied to her lawyer about some significant details because they were completely caught off guard and more than a little angry after the testimony. we like to believe it helped solidify some of the criminal charges placed against her. it was a nice bit of karma after years and years of gaslighting and false rumors, that her own lies got her caught.	2853	50300	bsomsy	eop88pj

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer, but work for a law firm as an investigator. one of our clients stabbed an ex-lover multiple times over $100. perp then ran out of the house all bloody. neighbor and her teenage daughter see him covered in blood and rush inside to see if they can help while they call 9/11. victim is still alive. on the 9/11 call the daughter made, you can hear the mom singing amazing grace while she tried to stop the bleeding. you can also hear the victim, with a stab wound in her neck, gurgling on blood while she tries to sing along. the emts arrived in under 3 minutes, but it took the police 19 minutes from the call to show up to clear the scene for them. she lived for 17 minutes. i saw the photos of the scene with the body still in place. it looked like a scene straight from dexter.	732	50300	bsomsy	eopiinn
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	edit: for those asking what's wrong with allowing the child to choose. the answer is nothing, so long as the child has the maturity and mental capacity to do so, and wants to choose. this child had none of those things, and was forced to choose right then and there between two people the child loved very much. also, i'm not making any commentary on which spouse was better; they both did this, ergo, they're both terrible. not a lawyer, but was a paralegal for many years. i worked mainly in family law. as i am sure other posters are doing in order to preserve confidentiality, i am going to be vague and also not include genders or locations. i had a client who was getting divorced. the client and soon to be ex spouse had a 12 year old son with autism. the two of them sat this poor fucking child down at the table one day and made him choose which parent he wanted to live with. our client called me to gloat that the child had chosen in their favour and to direct that paperwork be prepared. this client was a prominent member of the business community and earned quite a high salary, and was treating this child like a commodity. i was disgusted. i no longer work in law, but this one will always stick with me.	4739	50300	bsomsy	eop4xly

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i saw this play out in court. plaintiff was a prison guard who was pressured/forced to have sex/oral sex with her boss (the warden) on a number of occasions. the warden threatened to have her fired and blackballed if she refused or blew the whistle. after this carried on for a long while, she quit and filed a lawsuit. but unfortunately her idiot lawyer didnt timely file with the correct authorities. at the end of the day, her claim was barred and the warden enjoyed sovereign immunity. at the hearing, you could see the judge asking the prison guard questions to see if there was a workaround or some way for her complaint to survive the pending motion to dismiss. but there wasnt. that was hard to watch. it was even worse when the prison guard began to quietly cry. fortunately the warden wasnt at the hearing, and the attorney representing the state was professional and just focused on the legal arguments. he dipped out of the hearing in a hurry.	559	50300	bsomsy	eophqml
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	criminal defense attorney. i represent a guy charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, domestic battery, etc. the guy allegedly grabbed his gf from her house and took her to the nearby river to kill her. he denies this entirely. recently had a 404b hearing (where, basically, the state attempts to get his prior bad acts admitted as evidence at trial) where three prior girlfriends all testified that he strangled them, beat them, etc. at least one was hospitalized for a broken jaw. guy does not deny any of it. i was forced to cross examine all of them and the only thing i had to go on was their credibility and possible drug use/lack of memory. not effective at all. additionally, the local paper quoted me pretty much attacking these victims of domestic violence. the guy's face never changed during their testimony. realized then i do not care if he goes to prison for life because there is a zero percent chance he will not beat more women.	251	50300	bsomsy	eoq18si

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	civil defense here so maybe not as juicy as the crim defense folks. some of the work i do is employment defense, particularly sexual/age harassment/discrimination cases. im pretty cynical and see a lot of cases where plaintiffs are full of shit, particularly in harassment/discrimination cases. in one case i was defending a company and that companys manager, jointly. the manager seemed like a straight up guy and i pride myself in being a good judge of character. i was pretty convinced the case was just payback from a disgruntled employee. to my credit, the plaintiff, a 38 yo female, was a really poor employee by all accounts. still, it didnt prepare me from what i found doing a review of every email the company had stored on their servers. not only did this guy stick his hand down this womans shirt without consent, when she threatened to go to hr he said hed get her fired and make sure she never got a job again. the lady was a single mother with 3 kids. he also propositioned her for sex in exchange for a day off. he thought the email had been wiped because the company had a one year retention policy. apparently, some of the companys older emails remained on a sever before the policy was put in place because of the migration of the emails from an older outsourced it company (not sure if my terminology is right here). i had to substitute out of the case thereafter for conflict reasons since my two clients interests were no longer aligned.	1497	50300	bsomsy	eopdww8

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer but i worked in a federal prison. several inmates come to mind but the one i'll tell about is a former catholic priest. he'd given up his vocation years before but he got caught up in a child porn sting. at that time sentencing was based on how many images a suspect had. he had thousands and was facing a maximum of 40 years. the guy was in his 50's so that would have been essentially a genuine life sentence, since federal inmates can only earn 15% good time. at his sentencing hearing, and i read this transcript so i know this as a fact, he told the judge when he was a priest he'd molested hundreds of young boys. despite treatment and his own remorse he felt completely incapable of stopping his obsession with child porn and with molestation. he had not ever been even charged with these crimes but he felt guilty enough to admit them and then ask the judge to impose the full penalty so he'd be locked up for the rest of his life.	195	50300	bsomsy	eopuf0j

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	edit: very disturbing content warning. even though ive made a throwaway im going to be a bit vague because i still take my ethical duties to former clients seriously and cant breach privilege or the nda i signed. this is a story from a long time ago, during the summer after my first year of law school when i was briefly working at a well-known criminal defense firm. the client whose case i was working was one of several defendants charged with conspiracy to commit murder. three individuals had committed the murders, and several others had either helped plan it, abducted the victims, came along to watch, or ***filmed*** it. in order to see whether our client was one of the individuals present at the scene, i had to watch multiple videos of the murders. i watched multiple people brutally killed in about the worst possible way you can imagine - >!they were chopped into pieces while they were alive and had their skulls stomped in. it wasnt some grainy security footage. it was hd video taken by bystanders just a few feet away. the videos showed someones brain squirting out of their head and another person screaming as their hands and arms were hacked off.!< i also had to listen to the audio to see if our clients voice could be heard. the screams were bad. the laughter was worse. it has stuck with me for years and years, and i dont see it going away any time soon. thankfully my internship at that firm ended a few weeks later at the end of the summer. i never looked up the sentence from the case, and have no desire to. in our case there was no presumption of innocence - the individuals involved had all taken pleas in hope that the prosecutors wouldnt seek the death penalty. the only thing that would change was whether our client would get the death penalty (if he was present/filming) or life in prison (if we showed that he played a more minimal role). working in criminal defense meant setting my judgement for people aside so that they could be afforded the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. i still did my job to the best of my ability, but i found myself lying awake at night for several weeks in a row, praying to every god that i knew that each of those motherfuckers involved would fry in the electric chair, and that someone would laugh at their screams too. after that internship, i never returned to criminal law. i now practice civil law where i help people recover for wrongs done to them.	26783	50300	bsomsy	eoowzja

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my girlfriend was on the jury for a capital murder charge. he brutally raped and murdered a young mother and attempted to do the same to her toddler, who somehow miraculously (or not depending on how you look at it) survived. the son grew up and was about 14 by the time that this case was brought forward to determine if the death penalty would be used (obviously the killer had already been in prison, was found guilty long ago) or if he would avoid the death penalty and spend three life sentences in prison. he had originally attacked several women before this incident and sent two to the hospital, but was released with a slap on the wrist after serving minimal jailtime. the murder was preventable, but leniency let this violent man back out on the streets. what is sad is that every single witness for the defense was a member of his family, and every single one of them was caught lying under oath. even over the most inconsequential things. it's as if the whole family (mother, father, brothers and sisters) was physically incapable of saying anything truthful. none of them even showed any sympathy for the victims or even acknowledged that rape and murder are wrong. the killer showed no remorse either. what was really chilling, however, was the fact that every woman that he attacked looked strikingly similar to my girlfriend, and he stared at her with a blank expression almost the entire time. it really freaked her out and she still has nightmares about it.	675	50300	bsomsy	eopgnoj

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"long one, but crazy, so buckle the fuck up. not a lawyer, but i was a detention officer and baliff for a small town at the time. we had a guy, member of the largest church's elders, and all around ""great guy"" with money and a big house get brought up on attempted homicide charges against his wife. he wept, and prayed, and generally was the picture perfect ""wrongfully accused"" sort. he'd sniffle to me requests for a bible or religious tracts from his cell all ""god bless you"" and tearful thanks. half the town showed up to the court house for his bond hearing, which turned into a total circus where the 100+ people crammed into a room meant for 50 hissed and booed the prosecutor every time she tried to read the charges and evidence against him while raucously cheering the defense when he made counterpoints. zero docorum or order, and i had zero ability to ride heard, what was i supposed to do? shoot at them? guy got released on or to go back to work when regular bail would have been set at atleast $500k. well, i had acess to his legal history, as well as the evidence against him. he had a long, looooong history of escalating violence against multiple prior spouses in a few other states. he'd done jail time multiple times for it. basically, he'd beat the living shit out of her so bad that the cops could photograph the blood and drag marks in the snow where he dragged her, unconscious, to the truck. she woke up and he, holding a gun, also captured with his prints and her blood all over it from pistol whipping half her teeth out, declared that he was going to shoot her and then himself. she threw herself from the moving vehicle, ran to a farm house 400 yards away in her underwear and barefoot in -5 degree weather, and luckily they answered the door to let her in. she was hysterical as he drove circles around the house looking for her, and the police were called. in the 911 call you can hear her screaming at the two old people to run and leave her so he will just get her and not kill them too. the cops arrested him as he was hammering on the door with the butt of the gun screaming that he was going to get her sooner or later and if she ran she would just die tired. long story short, he got off with a minor parter family member assault charge (misdemeanor), which all the naive baby boomer wanna-do-gooders believe is a travesty and blame on the woman. his defense is that while he was in my jail she cleaned out his bank account and the entire thing was a setup to steal his money. she had no income and used the joint account to pay medical bills and flee the state. all the church-marms and assorted rubber neckers involved claim she was always a loose woman and just set him up to steal from him, and maybe he did ""smack her around a bit"" but only because her loose and unwomanly behavior pushed him over the edge. the ultimate worst part is, i cannot legally tell anyone the truth without being at a huge legal liability, and nobody would believe me anyways. i had to sit through circus after kangaroo court circus biting my toungue while that filthy snake plead down to a misdemeanor and half the town cheered about it like it was a soap opera. at one point i looked at the judge, whom i know very well as a neighbor, and the look in his eyes was like ""this is fucked, but i dont want a lynch mob to form, so fuck it."" his defense, whom i overheard chatting, knew he was guilty as sin, and is a dangerous sociopath, but knew that freeing him would ingratiate them with the town, and his lawyer is running for comissioner next election. i'm no longer in law enforcement, and i'm moving as soon as finances allow. fuck this hick ass county, and the fucked up people in it."	228	50300	bsomsy	eopkr5o

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i got arrested when i was younger and wound up county jail for a bit. when you first get transferred there from the police station holding, you end up seeing a judge who sets your bail. the whole thing is done from inside the jail and through a tv screen, so you never see the judge or your public defendant in person. it was my first time doing this whole thing and i was sticking nearby this guy that went by repo, who had been in and out of jail before. we're waiting for our turn in front of the judge and there is this kid ahead of us. they really didn't care much about privacy so you could hear the whole thing if you were next in line. this was was barely 18 years old, like just a week over and he had a rap sheet that was extremely long. they get to the current charge that he was in there for, which was allegedly smacking a brick over the head of an elderly man and robbing him. i was very surprised by that, but i was even more surprised at how repo reacted to this. even though he had been in and out of the system for all sorts of crimes and had met a ton of other criminals, something like that was over the top for him, especially since this kid was so young. it's pretty sad to think that this kid's life was already that messed up at such a young age and was probably going ro get worse from there.	2160	50300	bsomsy	eoow8t7
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not for a defendant, but as a prosecutor at the state attorneys office in miami. there was this 15 year old haitian kid when i was working in the juvenile division that still haunts me. i remember his face even now because he had two distinct tattoos on it, with very bloodshot eyes. he was arrested after he ran into police chasing after a teenage girl with a gatorade bottle. turns out the girl worked at a gas station and had called the police a week earlier because the boy was sitting outside staring at her. he had came back a week later, walked into the store and stole a gatorade in front of her without a word, dumped it outside, pushed a patron away and poured gasoline in the bottle, then starting walking back towards the attendant. she freaks out and starts running out the store, he comes in, gets a lighter and starts chasing after her. he runs right into two patrol officers and gets arrested. just looking at him in court freaked me out, which was unusual to say the least. he seemed completely dead inside, showed absolutely zero emotions and didnt say a single word at any stage, even after sentencing. 5 years later, i was watching the first 48 and saw the haitian kids mugshot at the end, with the same tattoos, arrested for home invasion and triple murder without motive in miami.	52	50300	bsomsy	eoqvtwr
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not clients, but i've done human rights work around the world and come across a lot of monsters. three of the things that have stuck with me the most are below. these were videos/photos that i needed to review for work i was doing: the 4 year old hog tied and shot in the head next to her similarly situated mother. mom pissed off the wrong drug traffickers. the migrant worker whose nipples were sliced off before she was killed by her rapist(s). the screams of a man being decapitated on video. equally monstrous are the governments who allow all of the above to happen because they've been bought, see the victims as less than human, etc.	194	50300	bsomsy	eopbfnr

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	my worst client was a woman who was rude, aggressive, argumentative, paranoid, she thought everyone was out to get her. she had a terminal illness and still acted like a total bitch. i represented her in 3 separate civil cases. she had gone thru 2 lawyers already who dropped her. at one point even the judge had talked to me in his chambers after a hearing to advise me on how to deal with her (opposing counsel was present). i realised she was a monster when i had to present her for direct testimony and cross exam (before a different judge in a separate case) and she was probably one of the best witnesses i had ever presented. i had been dreading presenting her because her demeanour could subconsciously influence the judges mind. surprisingly, she answered all the questions briefly and directly, she was empathic, and she handled the cross examination like a pro. i almost felt sorry for her. it was like she was a totally different person on the witness stand. the way she was able to act convincingly like a decent human being, knowing she was a bad person irl, showed me how much of a psycho she was.	82	50300	bsomsy	eoq61q2
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	i'm not a lawyer but i have a pretty unnerving story anyways. i work as a police officer and got a call up about a mom and dad fighting. dispatch (i believe thats what they call it in america. i dont work there) told me that the dad was drunk and was very aggresive. when we arrived there we saw a little girl knocked out while her sister hysterically crying was trying to wake her up. the dad took the new born and left the house leaving the kids and the mom behind. later we found out that he killed the baby because he thought it was from another guy. it wasnt he was just too drunk to understand it was his kid. i got to talk to the lawyer of the family and she told me he had done some horrid things to them like taping the kids to their chair and forcing them to drink alcohol. but the thing that struck me the most was the 911 call the 6 year old kid made from the other room. it was the most horrible sound to hear her so scared screaming if the police could please come. at the end of the call you hear her dad entering the room hitting and kicking her because she called the police. i had goosebumps all over my body and will never forget that call. sorry for the long story and excuse my english it is not my native language.	117	50300	bsomsy	eoppp0h
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	this is tame compared to many here and involved a civil case, not criminal. it might get a bit long because this was the first case i went to court for completely solo and left a lasting impression on me. i was doing some pro bono work for a legal aid clinic very soon after i was licensed (you get to practice all different areas of law so its great for learning, and the clients get free legal help) and they gave me this very easy case to dip my toes in on. simple eviction; my clients have received notice to get out for nonpayment of rent. i meet with them and theyre basically honey boo boos parents except every negative people of walmart stereotype you can think of: very entitled and aggressive, depressingly young but with a flock of children already. the wife says shes disabled so she cant work and as part of my client intake i ask what kind of disability she has in case it might be relevant or we could provide more assistance; she looks me straight in the eye and says i dont read good. knowing that, i make sure to read out anything i ask them to sign and try to make sure they understand the process. the gist of the case was they were living in a trailer home on some guys property, had stopped paying rent several months ago (i forget their reasons, but it was more the landlord is a jerk than anything actionable), and landlord has left them a notice to get out and actually filed for eviction. i immediately notice that the letter from the landlord is defective; he doesnt include some things he should have and had not waited the required time period (to give them a chance to pay and stay) before filing in court. so basically this is going to be super easy to get dismissed, but they dont have any grounds to challenge an eviction on (place is habitable, etc) so this is just a bandaid to give them more time to get rent together or find a new place. i explain this several times and stress that they need to either move out or pay their back rent. court day comes and its in a rural county almost an hour away at jp court. (justice of the peace, where you go if you get a speeding ticket. pro-tip: in many states these judges are not required to have any formal legal training at all.) we wait, our case gets called, we go straight up to the bench to talk to the judge. this frail old man stands, shakily holding some wrinkled loose papers, and slowly shuffles to the bench. i start to feel sick. the second he gets up there and the judge asks him to speak, my clients start loudly arguing and shouting over him and i have to remind them to shut up. landlord explains that hes illiterate and had to have a neighbor write the notice for him, and adds that these tenants are horrible people and have been harassing him and his daughter. judge asks our side, and my idiot clients both start shouting again. i finally get them to shut up and say your honor, the notice was defective, we motion to dismiss and hand him my motion. this poor judges face lights up at an actual legal argument being presented and he quickly skims my motion. he immediately rules in our favor, explains to the landlord that he will need to start the process over (give them new notice, wait 20 days, refile and repay the filing fee), then turns to my clients, who have the biggest shit-eating grins, and sternly tells them the same thing i had, that this doesnt do anything but delay their eviction. we go to leave and i feel god awful watching the landlord dejectedly slump away as i walk back to my car. im already thinking eff these people, im not helping them again (i had been very clear in my client agreement that my representation was only for this one court appearance, thankfully), when i hear them hooting and jeering. i turn to look and they have rolled down their truck windows and are shouting the most vile abuse at this old man as he fumbles to get into his vehicle - including nasty things about his daughter. they tear out of the parking lot cheering like their team won the super bowl, and on the long drive back, i realize a career in this is not for me. tl;dr my clients were assholes and i helped them prolong an old illiterate mans suffering via a technicality. still feel like shit about it.	161	50300	bsomsy	eoprvd5

"court reporter here: couple weeks ago a guy got sentenced to 90 years for killing his four year old. he was an abusive father, beat the kid often. finally he beat him so badly he realize he was going to get caught. so he boiled water and dumped it all over the kid to try and hide the bruises. then just left the kid. two days later the kid is walking down the hallway and his body just quits. loses control of his bowels. falls over and dies. the father than left him there for four hours before calling 911. when police got there he said he was clumsy and the burns were from the shower. they found he had 59 blunt force injuries, 16 to the head. the whole time the prosecutor was telling this to the judge during sentencing the guy just sat there shaking his head like was denying it. i asked the public defender after, ""how do you try to get someone like this off?"" basically he told me he tried to get him to have a lesser charge, not murder. and that he believes everyone has a right to a good defense. and he believes to guy has mental problems. but then he admitted to me it was the hardest case he has done because he has a 3-year-old daughter. that was a hard day at work. i can't imagine what that poor little boy went through before dying. i would have hated to had to cover the trial. i only hope the prison population hears what he did and give him some good old prison justice."	118	50300	bsomsy	eoplk3n

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	years ago i worked at a criminal defense law firm. the lawyers i worked for were very selective of the cases they took on. they did have murder cases, drug trafficking, assault and so on. mostly i felt sorry for those people and their families. there was one woman though that was evil. she tried to hire a hitman to kill her son in law. just looking at her , and without knowing what she did, she sets off the vibe of a manipulative control freak. watch out for overbearing mother in laws!	32	50300	bsomsy	eoq3mqt
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	not a lawyer but theres an infamous case in australia where i'd want to know what the defence lawyer thought of it all. &#x200b; his name was bilal skaff and he was ring-leader in the gang rape of 6 (known) teenage girls, ranging from him and 6 other guys to him and 14 other guys. there were times where they left the girls for dead after hosing them down and leaving them soaked to freeze in winter. this all happened (i think) in 2000 or 2001. his original sentence was appealed and he got less time. the evidence was damning and i'd like to know how the lawyer felt defending him. &#x200b; ps. his brother was also a part of it and reached his end of non-parole sentence, but when he applied for parole he was denied as he still claims it wasnt really his fault or that it was rape, instead claiming the girls were at fault/asking for it.	33	50300	bsomsy	eoqbgj5

lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"i've spent my career in property law. by and large, i would say that in civil law you don't meet monsters so much as realise that the real monster is often the whole way the law, or even society in general works. very early on, as a trainee doing a stint in employment law, i remember attending a meeting with a senior guy at some company that ran nursing homes that was a client of the firm. naturally, they employed loads of poorly paid, often female staff, and the main thing they were interested in was making sure that the workforce didn't get unionised and that the company didn't have to recognise unions. they did not want to have to pay their staff more or improve their conditions. not illegal, of course, and the people involved weren't personally evil, but it was a classic case of ""come see the violence inherent in the system."" to do what they were doing required them to be bad guys."	56	50300	bsomsy	eoq30sq
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	"like always, not exactly the answer to the specific question, but i doubt you're gonna have legitimate lawyers perusing reddit and telling you about their cases, seems like a very fine line of confidentiality to walk to tell internet strangers about things that happened in the courtroom, so i'll give my story. my ex-aunt has been through about 10 lawyer teams in what's going on an 8 year lasting custody battle. and we're not exactly in a place where there's that many lawyers, her last, and final, group she literally had to hire from another state because word has gone out in the legal community to not ruin your career associating with this woman. she has filed every cps/cys type of injunction accusing our entire family of rape and molestation to draw this out as long as possible. on my side, the one case that got brought up in court was that i had raped my then what would have been 8 year old cousin while i was studying abroad literally on the exact opposite side of the planet. obviously cys can't just ignore a claim like that, but when it finally got to a judge after these accusations and he realized ""wait, this kid wasn't within thousands of miles of the child in about a year from when this supposedly happened."" he brought her and her then lawyer up with contempt charges. i'm just vaguely describing it all, it gets way deeper and more fucked up. thankfully once a kid is 14 they get way more rights as far as court proceedings go, so he can finally tell the judge he wants nothing to do with his mom unless it's by his terms."	427	50300	bsomsy	eop7yj4
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	heard about this one through a friend: x is a young college student who gets picked up for drunkenly swerving through the road and had destroyed upwards of 10,000dollars of government and private property. my friend is graced with the task to defend. he says its going to be a quick one.gets back the next day, and he tells me the police searched the kids vehicles trunk and found about 400 pages of documents and six folders of photographs. the college student was bait for his parents and aunt and uncles to lure women back to their home where they would have a ritual orgy and a ritual burning of the body out in the middle of nowhere. they wouldnt keep any of the parts but they had a very lengthy record of how many people they were burning. those 400 pages.mind you not every page is each victim, they liked to document how the sex was and what the bodies looked like when they burned. apparently the student was off to get the pages and photographs bound into a book that he was going to make himself at a photocopy store for the familys ritual (not sure of the number) anniversary.	77	50300	bsomsy	eoq1rjf
lawyers of reddit, at what point ,when working for a defendant, did you realize, my client is a monster!?	worked in the public defensorship in brazil (rio) and in a private law office: - had a guy brought up in the public defensorship that kidnapped his 12 year stepdaughter, took her to a city almost outside of the order of the state of rio, then made her walk through the wilderness for three days. they subsisted of nuts they found and slept in the wild, while he alledgedly raped her every day, several times a day. eventually he makes her dig her own grave and says he was gonna kill her, but then changes his mind and tells her to run. later on guy is arrested and brought to one of those cops tv shows and says in live tv how he was going to kill all of his wifes family and publically confessed to rape and more. when i got to talk with him face to face he confessed the kidnapping but denied the rape. i saw the photos of the legal examination (honestly, i think by far the worst part of working with criminal law) and there were indeed no signs of rape, but who knows. - had a guy in our office, an ex politician, we used to call him the brazilian hannibal because he was convicted of a triple murder and answering for another triple murder we cared for. guy could only communicate through video, since he was stuck in a far off jail in the amazon forest for everyones safety. - had a victim client we represented that was a dickhead - a billionaire that was swindled by his secretary. he called several times a day screaming at us and we had to basically act as his servant. during his hearing the judge asked him how he could not have noticed one time that 10k dollars had disappeared from his bank account. he said that 10k is nothing for someone who has millions. judge was not impressed by the dickishness of the statement and our guy lost that one. be aware that we prep clients before hearings but i guess he wanted to do his show. - had a case we denied legal resource because it was a confessed child rapist. we had two lawyers team, my boss refused to represent him, the other said he would but only if he was allowed to beat the shit out him. so those were my most glaring cases, but i had my fair share of pedophiles, wife beaters, racists, fraudster and pieces of shit. sometimes you also see people that were genuinely sorry for what theyve done and sometimes the actually innocent ones being dragged out through hell and back. still think criminal law is lighter than shit you see in family courts.	55	50300	bsomsy	eopnuog

ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i made a throwaway for this one. a lot of people are saying they weren't really racist, but i was. i absolutely was. i grew up in an affluent area of orange county ca. my family had money, but not nearly enough as many of the kids at my school. i was an only child, got picked on, had pretty low self-esteem. my family were basically country club racists. basically they didn't actively drop n bombs all over the place, but they had prejudices and didn't push back at all when i started saying racist things as a kid. i absolutely said the n word with my friends, laughed about it, but was always too scared to do so publically. when i got to high school, i was big into right wing politics, wanting to join the army, and learning german. i wouldn't say i was a neo-nazi, my best friend's brother was a neo-nazi and i didn't hang out with any of his friends or want to go into that scene, but i often thought that i would have made a good nazi had i been a german during the third reich. i definitely had friends in high school, but i wanted to go to college in a place that was more conservative and less diverse than i currently was. i figured my life would improve if i went to a place like that. so what changed? i did move to a small midwest town and started taking german in college for real, i took history courses that kind of started to chip away at my view of the world. studying abroad in germany though my junior year is what really started to break the glass on my views. i thought that my german background and last name would win me some favors over there, but people didn't really give a shit at all. i saw that modern germany was categorically and vastly different than the one i crafted in my head. i made friends from all over europe and the world. i had some people i cared about really roast me for some nationalist and militaristic views i had, it made me really mad at the time but eventually, i took their criticism seriously. i came back and finished doing some work in history classes and wrote a paper on nazi propaganda. it was then that i really examined nazi viewpoints through recent experience sand saw how fucking dumb they were. i remember seeing a poster and the text said that the jews were both behind communism and capitalism and just thought, this is just complete fucking nonsense and the people who believe this are morons. i actually did go into the military, i did rotc in college and my time in rotc and active duty pretty much flushed the rest out of me. getting to know, working with, and leading people from different backgrounds and getting to see things through their eyes was an invaluable experience. so to summarize, meeting people from different backgrounds is probably the most important for me and really actually having meaningful conversations, and not walking way when you're challenged. the thing is, i didn't just say 'you're right, nationalism and being racist is wrong i get it now' when i was in germany. i fought back, i defended myself, i thought these people were just butthurt leftists and weren't going to take anything i said seriously anyway. but those conversations planted the seeds that grew over several months, and eventually, they made me recognize how wrong i was. second was i always knew it was wrong to hate people, but i still did. i didn't have an online support structure to keep me in the mindframe. had these online communities existed 10 years ago, i don't know if i could have broken out of this. edit: let me just add because people are seeing this. you often hear that hate is a poison. a huge part of being such a racist is being angry that so much of the world that doesn't conform to your narrow views of what a society should look like. you waste so much energy being so angry all the time. everytime you see a group of people in a place where you don't think they should be, or a couple of different ethnicities, or hearing different languages where you don't think you should be hearing them, you just react to this with anger it's just so fucking poisonous. once i started to let go of this a little bit, i tried to think about these feelings and wondered why i felt them. why were all of these people making me so angry? and why did i think it would be so much better if i was somewhere else? the answer, of course, were problems in my own life, my own feelings of inadequacy, my feelings i squandered a privileged background and couldn't meet my parents' expectations. once i started making those connections and take steps to improve the things in my own life i could control, i felt a lot better about myself and felt that i had a lot more to value in myself than being just a white guy from newport. hate really is poisonous. it poisons your self-image, your impression of others, your sense of empathy, your ability to humanize problems, your ability to connect with friends and family. but it doesn't have to be a death sentence, you can break out of the negatively reinforcing thought process. start by reading stories of people who are totally different from you, watch movies made by people like this, just try and kickstart the apparatus in all of us to give a shit about people. i've had the opportunity to travel to so many places since my first time in germany and the thing i've learned above all else is people by and large want the same things, to live somewhere cool, the hang out with their friends, provide for their families, etc. i'm sorry that it took me a while to learn this, but i do hope someone can see this and start have a gutcheck moment with themselves to think differently about how you think of others. edit2: go figure, i have a reddit account for 5 years and my first gold is on a throwaway where i confess to having been a bad human being. thanks for the gesture, but please, give it to someone more deserving	4680	18740	bnqk9j	en97f40
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	my father was a racist just like his father before him. my dad did his best to indoctrinate me and my brother with his racist ways of thinking. i believed my dads philosophy was truth until i entered first grade. that year i was sat next to the only black girl in my class. naturally, i hated her immediately. not only was she a n****r, but an uppity one at that. she was more outspoken than most kids i knew, which i considered to be rude, and her style of diction was different from what i was used to, which made it difficult for me to understand her at first. however as i was forced to interact with her throughout the year, i learned that she was everything my preconceived notions said she shouldnt have been. she was sweet, kind, funny, and intelligent. she helped me grasp the concept of arithmetic and was easily the best speller in our class. the idea that a black person could have all of those positive attributes, especially intelligence that surpassed that of a white person flew in the face of what i had been taught all my life up to that point. knowing that girl was the single experience that made me first question, doubt, and eventually reject my dads beliefs about race. that girl and i remained friends until she transferred schools after our third grade year. i didnt keep in touch with her and have no idea where she is now. if youre out there adia, thank you for just being yourself. you are the very reason why i went down a better path than the one i was shown. i sincerely hope that you are well.	14919	18740	bnqk9j	en8tvfx

(yep, literally, mexican ""n"" word is what my dad taught us to call them) well anyways, my deep hate for non-whites/non-christians was deeply rooted thanks to my parents. until in 2011, a tornado outbreak swept through the south. i did a lot of voluntary work, met some black people, but was still worried about being around them. until about a week or two later when our school reopened. we had a lot of new kids from various areas that were damaged. most of them black. so the next school year i get partnered up with this black girl in our history class, and i'm mostly focused on our project, but we ended up talking for a while. she ended up being my first girlfriend a few weeks later, and after i met her family and learned what they went through because of the 2011 outbreak, plus her parents were from birmingham during the civil rights movements, i started to learn that love is more powerful than hate. that ability to make someone smile, there's nothing better than that. while me and her broke up later on, she had a massive impact on my life. i still live in alabama, and i still hear racist remarks from my parents, and from strangers. they will pass away, and sure they may have already left behind their mark of hatred. but hate can be erased with love."	511	18740	bnqk9j	en90hts

(for the first time i was talking to a person of color like a person) after some time i became friends with the nurse, calling her sometimes just to talk with her. my brother couldnt speak, but i could see that he was a bit pissed. then one day my family came to visit again. i was very thirsty so i called for the nurse again. she arrived and my dad's eyes went up in flames, yelling how a ""animal"" could work in a hospital and treat his son. he consulted the doctor and she was forbidden from coming to our room. i was let go after 2 months, i never saw the nurse after the incident. but i realised what i was dealing with, my family is a bunch of racist assholes. when i came back to school, i instantly tried making friends with the black kids, but the damage has been done. due to my previous behavior they wouldnt hang out with me, and my old friends abandoned me because i was trying to make friends with black kids. we moved to the large city 7 moths later. there i instantly made friends with the kids of color. which was a shock to both other kids and teachers. that day when i came home i was yelled at and grounded ""forbidden"" from hanging out with them. i continued to be friends with them. my parents are still a bit pissed about everything, but soon im going to uni so i can hang out with anyone, no matter thier race, religion and other bullshittery."	66	18740	bnqk9j	en9l0c0

"former ""i'm not racist!"" white woman here. reading a book called the hidden brain by shankar vedantam changed my mind. it's about unconscious bias. it helped me understand that humans are drawn to people who look and act like them, and tend to distrust people who look different. this is an ancient impulse designed to protect tribes of humans from being attacked by outsiders, which may have helped in our hunter-gatherer days, but has no place in a global society. i took the [implicit association test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) discussed in the book, which showed that (surprise surprise) i had some implicit bias. so, from then on, i made it a point to ask myself: ""am i worried about that person because they're actually acting sketchy, or because their skin is a different color than mine?"" now, i'm less ""i'm not racist"" and more *""i don't want to be racist.""* i know that i've been living in a racist society. i know that marrying a black man doesn't give me a free pass or absolve me of racism. i know that my brain, like all human brains, can be full of shit sometimes and it's up to me to challenge my first impressions of people. **edit:** platinum?! thanks! i truly appreciate it."	751	18740	bnqk9j	en8lrld

"new account because people know my other one and i don't like to disclose this about myself. in 2005, my senior year of highschool, my father who was very distant throughout my childhood because he had active warrants on him in my home state was murdered by two black youth. he was attempting to buy drugs to sell in order to come visit me for my birthday. it went south and the younger of the pair shot him and threw him in a ditch on the highway. he walked then crawled for about a mile before bleeding to death. i got to witness the trial, when asked why he told his younger brother to kill my father. he said ""you can't trust a fucking white man"". their family testified with similar beliefs and that led me to view that every one of them hated me because of my skin. growing up in the south, i was already kind of prejudiced and that amplified it. i hated blacks with a passion. in my school, there were four and the rest were white. i was one of the most active bullies. when i opened my business, i put a sign that said ""proud to be white"" in opposition to a neighborly black business. the owner came to talk to me and i refused to speak with him. when he left, i flew the confederate flag as well. when the kkk came to march in my hometown, many businesses refused to give them hotel rooms or shelter them, i let them camp out in my yard free of charge as long as they picked up after themselves. when our local court voted to remove the confederate flag from the lobby. i helped share a petition to remove the ""black lives matter"" flag from it as well. and i offered a free drink with a meal to celebrate when it was. a few years ago, i was in an atv accident that really damaged my brain(wear a fucking helmet guys). my insurance didn't cover a lot of things. for a while i walked with a crutch. business started to dwindle and things were looking quite grim. i made the decision to shoot myself several times but never could go through with it. when one day i called to try to negotiate my medical bills, the hospital and debt collectors informed me that it was paid for. about a week went by and the store owner's brother came to visit. he told me that he had learned about my father and he was sorry. despite how miserable i had made his brother, he paid for my bills. and he was honest with me when he told me that he did it because it was the right thing to do but that he hated me with a passion. i broke down and opened up to him and we were able to understand each other. i'll never forget what he said when i told him what the people who killed my father said, "" they sound just as stupid and racist as you are"". and it took that to make me realize that all of my actions made me the same person to them that those two teens were to me that was three years ago and i've learned a lot. it's taken a lot of opening up and understanding. i made amends with the shop owner as well and apologize to everyone i've terrorized in high school in college. it's really took a lot of humbling and i can see why a lot of people would rather double down. i've lost a lot of friends and many other things because of who i am now. but i'm glad everything happened to me to change who i was."	231	18740	bnqk9j	en9dd0s
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"edit: thank you for silver, friend. i was never one who would say the n word or thought people of other races were beneath me or anything, but i did not understand systemic racism, or the impact that racist policies throughout history still have on people today. in other words, i was that, ""slavery is over. here's an mlk quote, but affirmative action is bullshit. i have a black friend."" white person. \* cringe \* so anyway, what changed all that was first of all, joining the army and actually living among people of every race, religion, background, and persuasion, in reasonably close quarters, for a few years of my life. when you actually get to know people well enough that a few of them will tell you how things really have been for them, it's really eye-opening. that was what showed me that no, things actually aren't equal now, even though the laws would make it seem as if they were. we're still experiencing the world in very different ways. after i got out of the army, and went to a state university for an engineering degree. two really important things happened there. first, my history professor, when i was a freshman, was a black woman who told the side of the story that you don't hear about much in most history classes. sometimes i was skeptical of what she was saying, but i'd always google it, and it turned out she was right. this opened my eyes to the fact that there's this whole story of our country that most of us never even hear, and that there are real and ongoing reasons for policies like affirmative action, and that concepts like reparations actually aren't crazy when you consider the ongoing economic impact of policies like jim crow laws. the other thing that happened which opened my eyes was when i was a junior, i got pulled over by a cop for speeding on the way to class, and was talking with my classmates about it. my experience as a white woman was that i got pulled over, and given a warning. my white male classmates said the police officers in our town (this was in the south, just for reference) were usually cordial with them, but always gave them the ticket. the one black woman in the conversation said the police were a bit rude to her and she always got the ticket, and the two black men had some real horror stories about this stuff, how they were always made to get out of the car, were sometimes asked if they could search the car, etc. it was just so obvious how differently we were treated. from then on, i made more of an effort to understand where poc are coming from when they say something is an issue rather than just thinking it's not an issue because it's not an issue for me. i used to not believe people on stuff like that, which was pretty fucking racist of me, but just learning more about it and listening to people's experience really changed my mind."	1100	18740	bnqk9j	en8h6l7

ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"it's weird because i used to be racist towards white people even though my best friend (only friend) was **white**. i never thought i was racist because, in the black community, you're not racist if it's towards a white person. ontop of this my family is super racist towards white people behind closed doors. the event that changed me was back in freshman year when my best friend (only friend) and i went to a supermarket out of town. i went over to the candy section and picked up 4 boxes of mike and ike for the 2 of us to binge while we write a youtube script. on my way to the cash register, i ran into my grandmother. she saw me then saw my friend and gave him a pissy stinking look, then the look on her face snapped and smiled at me which was weird. we had small talk and i introduced her to my friend, james. james and i were friends for about 5 1/2 years. my grandmother only heard of james, but never saw him in person. i told her my friend is james, the guy who i always hang out with and she had a shocked look on her face. she told me ""ddunknjay, you know candy is bad for you right? it'll ruin your teeth and ruin your life"" and she went off. i mentally thought ""wait pause, mike and ike is life"", and ignored most of what she was telling me. then she pulled me over to the side and told me to stay away from james because he'll try to control me because ""that's what they like to do"" and blah blah blah. i was still mad about the mike and ike so i just gave her a blank stare and didn't listen. i then went to the register and left. the whole encounter lasted 2 mins tops. while james and i were outside he told me, ""yo, ddunknjay i gotta feeling she doesn't like me"" and i told him he just has to warm up to her and he'll be fine. i called my grandfather down south later that day and told him what happened. he told me ""that's why i divorced that women"" and how he hates how racist her side of the family is. that's when it hit me, and it honestly made me hate her more. how this lady could blindly hate my only friend just because he's white when he was there when my brother died, when we used to stay up until 11am playing halo 2, when we tried to start a minecraft lets play, when *we* were running away from that mall shooter, and how we helped each other build up in the youtube film industry. she doesn't even know him but she hates him, wtf kind of sense does that make. this event really changed how i look at the rest of my family throughout high school, because most of them are exactly like that. i know i can't change them so i don't fight it, also i have nowhere else to go so i can't bring those ideas in my house. so, for now, my escape is when i commute to college daily. ^(edit: purge:bing; if i remember after my exam tomorrow, i'll post the story about the mall shooting on my 18th birthday)"	300	18740	bnqk9j	en8v90x

ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i was born and raised in a small city in serbia in the 90s. as people may or may not know, serbia has gone through a lot of turmoil throughout that time and it has made serbians very nationalistic and quite aggressive, see the kosovo situation right now. as a child my whole family told me that muslims were bad people and that to make it easier to spot muslims, anyone who isnt white is bad and should be treated as inferior. at around the age of 9 i moved to belgium, after the nato, bombing, and went to a public school which was a cultural shock for me, there were koreans, ethiopians, congolese, belgians, marrocans, etc etc all in just my class of 20 people. didnt take me very long to realise that i feel more at home with the foreign kids and my view changed, slowly but surely. my parents still stood by their believes of course. years later my friend group is very diverse, my love for hip hop made it that most of my friends were non belgian nationals, and i loved it. only thing my upbringing was still standing in the way of, was being attracted to anyone that wasnt white. sure enough, a couple years later when i was 20 i meet andafrican american girl who was on erasmus and just every little thing about her was enticing. this girl is extremely smart, witty, hot, outgoing, the whole nine yards. and i fell head over heels for her. took me 3 months to pick up the courage and bring her home to my mom. a lot of awkward smiles and slightly racist jokes ensued. her year abroad ended and we decided to do the long distance thing. fast forward 7 years; 2 years of living together, 5 years of long distance. were married since september, and planning on me moving to america within this year, my parents consider her not just their daughter in law but just a daughter period. i took her to my family in serbia last week and everyone is enchanted by her, even my 82 year old grandpa cried after meeting the girl he heard so much about. never underestimate the impact a single positive person can have.	42	18740	bnqk9j	en9nq0x

ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	used to hate gypsies. growing up, always had problems with them. they were the group associated with crime in my hometown. got into fights, gunfights, stole metal sculptures, manholes, caused trouble. most of them didn't work, just squatted buildings and lived off welfare stealing stuff for extra income. anyways, got into a shit life situation myself. became homeless for reasons out of my control, lived in a squat for a bit then moved into a hostel where i lived while working as i couldn't find a place to rent. one day i get new roommates in the hostel room, and what do you know, 5 gypsies. they traveled from another country and were in town for the christmas period, playing music. they were such a nice group and i immediately went on good terms with them. until one day when i woke up and saw my pants weren't the way i left them. what do you know, there was some money missing. now, i was more sad than angry about it. we have been sharing the room for a month or so now, and it made me really sad that someone from the same room would steal from me. i was on the top bunk too, so someone literally climbed on my bed while i was sleeping. one important note is, the gypsy group weren't my only roommates, there were two other guys as well. so when they all woke up, i just said to work it out who stole from me. i'll cut this story short as i just got home from work and am really tired. i figured out who the guy was. it was some little shit who i actually lent some money before and told him he doesn't need to repay me as i knew he was a struggling student. on the day the gypsy group was leaving, they came to the hostel some 20 minutes after me, so this is like 4am(i was a bartender, so the late shifts were common). we get to talking, and one guy mentions the day my money went missing. he went to explain how terrible he felt because i was the only one who talked and made jokes with them the whole time they were there, and he wanted me to know it was definitely not them who stole from me. he explained how they all felt shitty as they were gypsies, and the stealing stereotype is well know to them. my heart sank. i never did apologize for making it seem like they stole from me. i apologized then and there, and said that i know who did it, and how horrible i feel because of the whole situation. one of the nicest guys i've met, and had some great laughs with them. got some of them on facebook, always love to read their updates. edit: i do hope the story makes sense. i'm really tired, but wanted to reply to the question.	12	18740	bnqk9j	en9gmla
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	this is more of a full-on intolerance change thing, but here goes: as a suburban whiteboi, i was sheltered as fuck. my parents were both racist bastards, still are, and i was bullied by literally everyone in my grade (including the few kids who werent white). so, i grew to be super fucking racist and, for some reason, homophobic. it wasnt until like 8th grade or so when i realized i was bisexual that i reflected on my hatred. i realized it was more about negative feelings i had for myself than it was for the people that had wronged me. so, i gave a shot at seeing how people were. ive changed my mind since then, and am not an intolerant cunt anymore.	32	18740	bnqk9j	en8zm5a

"i grew up in the rural south in the us. i was raised by a family of racists. both sets of grandparents and both parents told me horrible, horrible things growing up. here are things that i have heard/continue to hear from my family (i want to cry now as i write this). my paternal grandmother used to tell me that you can't trust n*****s because they are all theives and liars, that she would beat us (me and my brother) if we ever brought home a black girl, and that anyone who liked black people was a n*****-lover. my paternal grandfather used to regularly refer to president obama as a ""big-eared n*****"" and had a racist statue of a young black boy with pitch black skin and big, bright red lips eating a watermelon, on which he painted the word ""obama"" across the forehead. when my mother was a child, she was taken out of her school and moved an hour away just so she wouldn't have to go to school with black kids when the schools in the area were *finally* desegregated. her father has said, many times, that he would rather my brother and i be dead than marry a black woman (except he didn't say black). my grandmother on that side once told me that there were three things i better not ever do: (1) smoke, (2) drink, and (3) date a black girl (jokes on her, i've done all three). fun fact. both of my grandfathers are preachers. when i was a child, my mom used to have this exchange with me a lot: mom: ""guess what?"" me: ""what?"" mom: ""you're a n***** and i'm not."" i guess i've never really been a racist myself, but i have behaved in racist ways throughout my life in an effort to fit in. i only say all of this to show that racism is never something you are born with, it is something that the ignorant and weak-minded pass on to their children. what changed for me was that i realized that my family were uneducated, willfully ignorant, bigots who never questioned the awful things they were taught as children. i am grateful for the internet and technology, because without them, i may have ended up the same. i wish i could say that they are different now but in the age of donald trump, they have tripled down with their racism. i wish i could open their eyes to the things they don't see in the world, but now my only option has been to sever all ties with anyone other than my brother. we are super liberal now and despise our family."	26	18740	bnqk9j	en95871
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	not really ever a racist, but could have been. as a kid, racism was fairly normal. people applied labels to each other and assembled in groups that looked alike. in my area, there wasnt a lot of animosity or violence, but there was tension. as a kid, i was probably spared a lot of direct racism. at the same time, i realized that while my friends looked different, we were otherwise largely the same, focused on spelling and math and recess. the names were hurtful, and the divide unnecessary. we all agree to not perpetuate the things. since then, the differences in people are just visual. i prefer to celebrate and learn from the diversity and differences. honestly, i have a harder time with accents and colloquiums than i do with anyones origin, no matter how you choose to trace that. the problem is mine, too, not theirs, in that i just sometimes take a pass or two to get the sentiment or gist or straight verbiage because of yall instead of you all or whatever.	28	18740	bnqk9j	en8au88

"not sure if this counts, but i was mormon once, and while mormons will tell you that they just don't agree with the concept of homosexuality, let me make this perfectly clear: mormons view gay people as a weird mix of richard simmons, and dracula. the belief that their lifestyle is fundamentally a sin, they actively engage in predatory behavior lure suspecting young men into this lifestyle. to top it off, i was homeschooled, so i never even met a gay person until my first job. he was about as stereotypical as could be, a hispanic, flamboyant, movie theater worker, one of several homosexual people that worked there. to go from having never had contact with such persons, to having about 6 i would regularly interact with over a week and in the weeks forward was.alarming. i was on guard constantly, generally avoided them when not directly being supervised by one, or asking questions of the others. anyway. back to the first guy. about 3 months of being employed, it's a school week tuesday. quiet as a tomb. it's just me and we'll call him joe. i looked at him, while restocking the fridge, and the question just popped into my head, and past my gums before i could stop it: ""joe, do you ever check out my ass when i'm bent over the popcorn or anything?"". joe, sassy latino queen that he was just replied without missing a beat ""honey, you don't look that much like brad pitt."". and that was all it took. being a rational man, and having observed them over 3 months, recognizing they didn't lure anyone to an untimely hiv ridden demise, hell, if anything, they seemed healthier than my bishop. they had never intended me any ill, i was just a coworker, and joe was just another guy, with an odd kink, looking for someone like him, and who the fuck was i to judge, i was a mormon into bondage. me and joe got on a lot better after that, alongside of the other guys that worked there. if you can challenge your preconceptions, you might learn something, and the world will be better for it."	13	18740	bnqk9j	en9j4k6
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i was an overall piece of shit, trolled multiple groups of people. made racist jokes. i'm honestly not sure if i just enjoyed the attention, or if i honestly believed in the abhorrent shit i was spouting. i've changed a lot now, in my older years, and hold the line for those that can't. i came out as queer, am a feminist, and i try to be an honest politically correct person, without going overboard into militant behaviour.	71	18740	bnqk9j	en8iwaq
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	teenage rebellion mostly. i was raised in a fairly racist family where the n word was used regularly. the area where i grew up is still casually racist. when i hit my teen years, i guess i took a look at the beliefs i was raised with and realized they were mostly bullshit. i owe a huge debt of gratitude to my froend's parents for setting a much more tolerant example for me when i really needed to discover what i believed.	6	18740	bnqk9j	en93dlx
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	not ex-racist, but ex-homophobe. i realized that i was wrong about non-straights, and i realized that i was being brainwashed by my extremely redneck homophobic mother. long story short, i try to ignore all the conservative hogwash she speaks, and i am actually closet bi-sexual.	6	18740	bnqk9j	en98u9r
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"i met a black person. that was pretty much all it took. i met her and got to know her and her friends and realized some are great and some suck, just like every other race. i grew up in the middle-of-no-where new hampshire. i only saw non-white people when we would take a school trip to a museum or other places. i only knew about people of color from the stereotypes on 80's tv and the racist remarks from my family. i laughed at all the racist jokes and ""knew"" white people were better than everyone, except maybe asians, because they were good at maths. black people were a drain on american society but that was our punishment for forcing them into slavery. my sophomore yeah in college i was randomly assigned a roommate and she was black. she might have been the first black person i ever really had a conversation with. i got to know her and her friends, most of who were also black. some of them i became very close friends with. one of my second cousins dated and had a child with a black man and some of my family shunned her. i was never brave enough to tell my family that while in college i also dated a black man and in a different life i could have saw us happily married. i didn't do very well in college and my dad still blames it on the fact that i was roomed with ""one of those"", but really it was because that was the year i started smoking pot and drinking because i finally had friends to go out with."	6	18740	bnqk9j	en9ivr8
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	no event(s) in particular. i simply matured. i grew up in one of the more affluent counties in america, but i (white male) was a minority in my high school. essentially, year after year, we heard all about the plight of the minoritywe celebrated diversity (that is, anything non-white), even cheered black/latino pride groups. eventually, celebrating others ethnic groups while celebrating your own was implicitly taboo took its toll. it was very easy to fall into the why cant we have white heritage month? mindset. and honestly, thats all it wasa nave, sophomoric attitude, borne not of hate, but of (always) perceived and (often) actual alienation. im not saying we were justified in our views. indeed, we were no more justified in our views than the other side was in theirs.  that being said, the innocent why cant we have white heritage month? perspective is prone to exploitation by the far right, the same way other marginalized groups are prone to exploitation by the far left. in the end, we were all just useful idiotsat least until we educated ourselves.	6	18740	bnqk9j	en9l6ws
ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	"never was a rascist but had stereotypes. talked to a lebanese guy about a commercial depicting a woman putting on sexy lingerie under her burka. before that, i'd read an article about how all the muslim world was in rage over this commercial so my stupid teenage head assumed that this muslim guy would be offended. so i showed him the commercial and asked how he felt about it. ""this makes me horny!"" was his response."	6	18740	bnqk9j	en9lexq

ex-racists of reddit what event or events changed you?	i grew up hearing that white people were evil and secretly controlled society and the cause of all the world's ills, and that almost all racism was whites being racist to nonwhites. but then i met a lot of white people and they were almost all really nice. plus i learned that warfare, slavery, etc. have been very common worldwide for all of known history and western civilization was the first to get rid of it.	5	18740	bnqk9j	en9t5eh

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	former boy scout here. i worked a summer camp in missouri one summer. one week we had a troop of mentally disabled guys stay at the camp. they were all older than standard boy scouts. one i took a liking to. big dude who you would be frightened to death to cross on a dark street. but he was mentally a 5-year old. he had zero confidence. i wanted to work on that. so i guide him all week but make sure he does as much on his own as humanly possible. we get to woodworking day and i help him construct as much as he feels he can. he just doesnt want to use the hammer to sink the nails. i do a few but notice every single thing he does, he does better than he feels and i decide im going to have him do it, whatever the cost. i give him the hammer. he declines. i tell him i believe in him. he declines. i say, tell you what. ill hold the nail for you, i trust you that much. i know you wont hurt me. he took the hammer. i hold the nail. i bit down hard expecting a broken finger. **whack** that nail went down like it was made of butter. he didnt even pinch my finger as the head of the nail went down. he hit it perfectly. he saw it and dropped the hammer and started wringing his hands and tried to be excited without making a scene. my heart was so full for him. i felt amazing for taking that risk. that was over 20 years ago, and ive never forgotten it. i now have two young daughters who i put my physical self on the line for regularly. sometimes it works out. sometimes i gain new scars. but i know being the someone who trusts you no matter what makes any physical pain not even a consideration.	3492	20618	bls9ab	emrqc6l
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"a friend i went to high school with is an elementary school teacher at a school without a lot of money. she did one of those ""gofundme but for teachers"" things, i can't remember the site exactly or what the project was - something tech-related. she posted it on facebook and there was a decent amount of sharing and stuff, but outside of a few $25-50 donations there wasn't a lot of actual activity. a month or two goes by and i check up on it again, it's only like halfway to the goal with a few weeks to spare. i finished it out and paid for the rest of it, i wanna say it was $300 or something like that. never told anyone i know about it, left it anonymous on the donation too. this is actually the first time i've mentioned it to anyone at all. just felt good."	2784	20618	bls9ab	emr9e1w
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i (riding on my bike) saw a man lying on his back in the middle of an adjacent sidewalk. while it's fairly common around here to find homeless people passed out in doorways and whatnot, and therefore relatively easy to ignore, this guy was different. nicely dressed, clean, not obviously homeless, and really, really still. nobody was stopping. it was in broad daylight. i got off my bike and checked on him - his eyes were rolled back in his head, then would randomly roll around, his pulse was weak and slow, he was breathing, but very slowly and shallowly. once i stopped people started getting interested, but when i asked someone to call 911, everyone took off. i called them myself, and they wanted me to do cpr. i only had one functioning arm, so i again asked for help. all the rubberneckers again disappeared. fortunately an ambulance arrived quickly. i still don't know what happened to him, but i hope he was okay. i also called 911 for a guy that was obviously homeless, and drunk, at night in a mostly deserted area, because he was passed out face down on a sidewalk with a nearly empty bottle of bourbon in his hand, and a growing puddle of blood stemming from where he slammed his head when he fell down. i would rather risk some personal safety than wonder if another human bled out because i didn't want to be bothered. yes, i understand not stopping to help a guy in a van on the side of a deserted road in the middle of the night, or another dozen other scenarios. get somewhere safe and call the police! but i'm baffled as to how people can just flow around a person in need in broad daylight in a well-populated area.	4905	20618	bls9ab	emr64xm
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	knew someone at school who was raised by a single parent, said parent develops cancer and my friend, who had been obviously depending on her, became utterly depressed. couldnt cook meals, finish schoolwork, do sport, most of his time was dedicated to his parent. i cooked/bought meals for him, helped him catch up all his missed classes, organised stuff to get him outside, etc. hes doing better now, so is his mum, although we dont talk anymore. still, felt worthwhile.	11195	20618	bls9ab	emr3efx

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i came home late on a delayed flight and there was an old woman sobbing at the bus depot because no one was there to take her home. this was in the middle of a bad snowstorm at 1 am so no one wanted to drive. i picked her up and drove out of my way to drop her off. had to drive an extra half hour in the worst conditions ever but it all worked out.	19467	20618	bls9ab	emr5ujx

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i helped a waitress at a restaurant i frequent. after a few months of patronage i knew most of the staff and was on a first name basis with them. i learned that she was working 6 days per week, 8 to 10 hours per day, *and* going to school full time (5 days per week, 6 hours per day), *plus* she traveled by bus between 2 and 3 hours per day. a quick bit of mental math. on a bad day she could spend 19 hours with her obligations, not counting bathing, eating, or homework! and after she paid for her tuition, she only had 10% of her paycheck left over. as i have no family nor children of my own, i decided to pay for her university. she has since quit her job and is focusing on her studies. she regularly sends me updates about her classes and i'm happy to report she's getting straight 'a's as a psychology major.	10309	20618	bls9ab	emrg6f0
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i switched from one type of insulin to another. after switching, i had about 30 vials of novolog left over that i didn't need. we had a guy come out and do electrical work on our house and saw that he wore an insulin pump. i asked him what kind of insulin he used. he said novolog. i asked him if he wanted my leftover, non-expired, still sealed vials. he said sure. i imagine he was thinking that it was going to be only a few. i loaded them all up into a walmart bag and gave them to him. i don't know if he had to pay out of pocket or anything for his, but even if he did, the total cost to him for it could have well exceeded $1,500 in just co-pays alone. he was nearly in tears when i told him to keep it all.	14847	20618	bls9ab	emr83ai
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"this happened about 10 years ago. i had an early childhood education class in college that involved observing/interacting with preschoolers. the college has a daycare for locals and teachers. one day we all decided to take the kids to a nearby park. this park was pretty secure but there was a very busy road right next to it, and there were gaps in the fences. one of the kids mom's decided to come early to pick up her son. she parked on the other side of the street and was waiting to cross. the kid saw her and basically immediately started running and climbed through the fence and was going into the street. i noticed and ran as fast as i have ever in my life, leapt over the fence (it was only about 3 feet) and grabbed the boy literally a split second before a huge flatbed truck zoomed passed going at least 65+ mph. i looked up and saw the mom and tears were pouring from her eyes and she was screaming, because from her perspective all she could see would definitely give the impression her son was hit. so she runs over and i just hand her the boy and she's in total panic and terror. the instructor gets over and tells me thank you and says ""we are never coming to this park ever again."" and she holds the mom as she's crying. i just stand there in shock. she took the kid home. we all walked the kids back to class. tldr: i saved a 3 year old boy's life."	4051	20618	bls9ab	emr5otm

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"an acquaintance talked about suicidal thoughts over several weeks online. one day he said ""goodbye forever"" and left all groups. i found his address and sent an ambulance there. he's feeling better now, and thanked me a few days afterwards."	9522	20618	bls9ab	emr2ove
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was walking down the street yesterday and someone's garbage can got flipped over because it was windy so i picked it all up for them, there was quite a bit of trash laid out over their lawn and i assume they weren't home. it's probably not the nicest thing i've done, but it's the one that came to mind first due to its recency.	1549	20618	bls9ab	emr4tfk
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	once i found a girl curled into a ball in the subway stairs. she had been having coffee with her friend, and in the time she had reached the station she got a call that her friend had been hit by a car and died. she was in shock. i stayed with her for half an hour, simply being there so she wasn't alone, until she recovered enough to go on her way. we've never met again, of course. this is a huge city.	10123	20618	bls9ab	emr01g7
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	took the time to listen. there was this girl who was a grade below me. she didn't have a lot of friends. seemed to come from a strict family. we went to a small school so it's hard not to at least know a face. on a school trip we got to talking. her details are not important. i had been through some shit. small school. small community. my shit was known. i assume that's why she opened up to me. ran into her several years later. she said i saved her life with that conversation. she'd been thinking about suicide. now she was thriving in college. i haven't forgotten that lesson.	1406	20618	bls9ab	emrbm2a
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my wife and i paid for a little boys hospital and medical bills so his feet could be fixed, allowing him to walk and run with the other kids.	304	20618	bls9ab	emrbx5q
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"i live in a city. so usually i just ignore all the beggers asking for money because it's so common and a majority are noticeably just feeding their addiction. but one day i decided to head to a popeye's for lunch. i saw a kid walking on the sidewalk on my way in, maybe 16 or 17. long, unkempt hair. shirt with holes. shoes with the soles that are coming detached or had no sole at all. and this was in the middle of summer where it's 90+ on a daily basis. and he had some really severe sunburn. this was a kid who looked like he was really in distress. i got in line and ordered food. decided to eat at the restaurant that day when i usually just get it to go. about 10 minutes later, the kid walked in and asked the lady at the register for a water. she was quite snobby and said no without second thought. so the kid's eyes filled up and he walked away without putting up a fight. he sat in booth and looked like he was just trying to get relief from the heat. i hung up my phone, walked over to him and gave him $10 and said ""head up to the counter and pick out anything on the menu."" he wiped his tears away, his eyes lit up in genuine disbelief. he kept asking if i was sure. i insisted. so he went up and just ordered the bare minimum, 1 piece of chicken, 1 side, and a water. he came back with roughly $5 in change and wanted to give it back. i insisted he kept it and invited him to sit down and have a meal with me. he was so polite and had a great heart. just one of them people you meet with a gentle soul. we had some small talk and the whole time he just kept thanking me for the food and for being generous. afterwards, i ordered him a small dessert and told him to keep the change from earlier. and got him a water to go. he thanked me, shook my hand, and i was on my way. i got back to my car and just broke down for a few minutes. i don't know what ever happened to him. i don't know where he ended up. i don't know if he was just taking advantage of me or not. i'll never know anything about his situation for sure. but it really opened my eyes to the desperate need that people are in. in our normal hustle and bustle of the day, there's people just literally struggling to survive. really just put my whole life and situation in perspective. i don't know if that kid remembers me or that encounter, but i'll remember him for the rest of my life."	871	20618	bls9ab	emridc3
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my boyfriend never thought his birthdays were a special thing, for his birthday i contacted all of his friends (weeks in advance) and asked them to send a short video of them wishing him a happy birthday as some of them are abroad. i then made a compilation video of these as well as pictures of him growing up just to show him how special he is to everyone around him, especially me, and how much he has impacted my life and so many others in such a positive way. i showed him this after i took him on a limousine ride to the shard in london and gifted him a star in our names at the top of the building. he's done so much for me, i wanted his day to be just as special as he makes every day for me.	2829	20618	bls9ab	emrebfk
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	once i was running at a cross-country competition, and i happened to fall into pace with a girl i'd never met before from another school. we chatted a bit, just the average stuff, and she seemed nice. i soon noticed that she was occasionally taking a puff from an inhaler. when we were about 2/3 of the way around the mile long track, she tried to take a puff, but it had run out. soon enough she was having a full on asthma attack, and i didn't really know what to do, but i knew it was quite serious. i told her she should stop, and go to the medical tent, but she refused to. i tried to persuade her, and she was obviously in a lot of pain. i even offered to giver her a piggyback, but she said we'd get disqualified. (which i didn't see as the biggest issue right then.) we were almost at the end by then, so i figured the kindest thing would just be to give up on getting in at a good place, and encourage her to the end as she wasn't giving up. i gave her my arm, and half carried her to the finish line. i let her finish the place before me, because she had worked a lot harder on that race than anyone else. i haven't seen her since, and i can't even remember her name, but i hope she's doing well.	597	20618	bls9ab	emrden9
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	befriended someone so they wouldn't commit suicide. a year later and we're still good friends	2055	20618	bls9ab	emr5ujb
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	an old buddy of mine was having trouble with his graphic design homework and i was a year ahead of him in university. so he comes to me asking for help because he knows he isnt that good. i proceed to go to his room and sit there for a solid 6 hours helping him understand fundamentals, learn hotkeys, and answer any of his questions. the next day he says he is now passing and his teacher is proud of how much he has improved. he gives me a burrito and we call it even. edit: whoa gold?! thats my first one! thanks kind stranger!	8689	20618	bls9ab	emr4rz2
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i am a 9/11 survivor. i was in concourse when first plane hit. long story very short, i was carried out by a police officer and put in an ambulance. as ambulance was pulling away, the first tower goes down. the cops body was found 4 months later. his 2 kids went go to college on me. i did it anonymously. not all us wall st. guys are pricks, just most of them.	6061	20618	bls9ab	emrju2j
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i persuaded my boss to give my autistic colleague a raise because she deserved it and would never go to ask herself. edit: thanks for all the lovely reactions, silver and gold! i'll explain the situation a bit further since this got a lot of upvotes. i work for a company that sells steel parts and we had a client that required every purchase of a particular steel grade to be hardness tested in a very tedious and antiquated way. it was a repetitive job and the colleague i'm referring to was hired for it because of her autism. the company got subsidized to employ her and she liked the routine of the job. we work with a small team in the warehouse, which is in another city than the sales office (and manager/ceo) is located. it's a relatively small company and we don't have any scheduled hr talks or whatever. so if you don't make an appointment with the manager our wage or work is just never discussed. that's why i took the initiative to negotiate (without her knowing) to get her a pay raise. i had a very good relationship with her, we had become good friends. due to the pleasant atmosphere in our team she had also blossomed into a much more all-round worker than what she was initially hired for. she's just a smart and kind hearted woman with a lot of humor, but very unconfrontational and socially anxious due to her autism. bad experiences with people exploiting her in her previous jobs had made this worse throughout the years. in our team she was fully accepted. she worked hard and efficiently without ever complaining. so it was right for her to get a raise and she would have never gotten it spontaneously. i only did what i thought was right. when i told her she got a raise she was super happy, in tears. we are still friends and see each other, even though she is retired now. yesterday i had lunch at her house, which we do every couple of months. and she told me more than once how happy she is that the last job of her career was such a positive experience.	788	20618	bls9ab	emr7z53
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	bought a car for an employee. i(f/28) was the gm at a pub a few years ago. had an amazing waitress(f/24) single mother with one more on the way. she had no personal transportation in a city with notoriously bad public transit. still somehow made it to work each day, even if it meant walking her pregnant self 5 miles. she was always stressed about trying to provide for her kids, but was still professional and hard working. my tax return was pretty good that year, and a friend happened to be selling a reliable older car for a reasonable price. i moved not long after that, but she found me on social media years later to thank me, and explain that she was in a good place now and would like to repay me. i turned her down, seeing her success was 100% worth the cost of the car.	1207	20618	bls9ab	emra621
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this kid showed up to track everyday and ran in the february cold in a tshirt and shorts so i gave him a hoodie and still see him wearing it all the time	1411	20618	bls9ab	emr2hc7
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this one sticks out. i was at a gas station roughly 11pm on a weeknight. the young girl in front of me has the counter filled with junk food and soda. basically the shit to keep you going on a long night. anyways her card was declined and she seemed very upset. keep in mind while upset she was never rude or anything. just annoyed. i walk to my car with my stuff after i paid while she sorted out her card issue. i then notice the only other car in the station is filled to the brim with clothes/belongings. it then clicks in my head this girl is down on luck. i walk back in the store and bump into her at the door. i tell her if she wants ill gladly buy all the things for her and anything else she needs. she gave me this odd look and agreed. im probably 24 years old at the time. after helping her carry the stuff to her car she looked at me with the saddest face and asked. why did you do that. i smiled at her and said. you were in the store buying all the foods i would be buying in a similar situation, so i figured you were normal. now if you were buying the bananas and old fruit i would have been more sceptical we had a short laugh about it and we went our separate ways. always wondered how things turned out for her.	4948	20618	bls9ab	emr4uuo
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	helped them get a copy of their birth certificate, ss card, apply for college, and earn a full scholarship. i had a student a number of years ago who's mom died when she was little, and dad abandoned her and scooted over to europe. she was being raised by her sister, who was 2 years older than her. she didn't have any copies of any of her official documentation. i had her when she was 15, and we bonded well. i knew her situation and helped her and her sister out (rides to work, making sure there was protein and vegetables in the fridge, stuff like that.) eventually, college time rolls around, and she kinda nervously came to me and said she needed help getting her paperwork in order so she could take her driver's test and start applying to schools. let me tell you, it's a friggin' nightmare to try to get paperwork from nyc (she was born in a hospital there, but couldn't remember which one) without a parent in the picture. it took us the better part of 6 months to get it, which involved several failed attempts, a newspaper story, and the involvement of our congresswoman's office. eventually, though, from all the press, she got her paperwork and a woman's league adopted her and hooked her up with a scholarship. good stuff.	249	20618	bls9ab	emrbz90
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	bought some random person a train ticket when the train was about to leave in 2 mins and he didnt have enough change on him (he had a credit card, but the machine did not accept it).	696	20618	bls9ab	emr2ng3
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i've bought groceries and school supplies for several families in the area that obviously needed the help, but didnt' have the ability to ask or were just unable to. one that sticks out in my head the most was a young woman who was trying to buy both during a tax holiday we have here in alabama. she was in front of me at walmart, and just flat out couldn't cover all that she needed, so she started putting stuff back. her daughter crying over crayons was what broke me. little girl wanted the big box, and her mom was putting it back. i said excuse me, walked passed her and put my card in the reader. no kid should ever have to cry over the big box of crayons.	2151	20618	bls9ab	emr6lau
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	after this girl in 3rd or 4th grade had bullied me for months i found her crying in the back of the bus. i asked her what was wrong and she denied telling me. i spoke to her friends and they said she wouldn't tell them eather so i went and managed to get her to tell me what was wrong. it turned out her father had been molesting her and he had just been sentenced to prison. i sat there the rest of the bus ride and talked to her about it and helped her calm down a bit. i know that must have extremely traumatic and i hope her life is better.	1030	20618	bls9ab	emr9e5r
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i talked to a friend who wanted to kill himself. his family was trash and didn't even try to prevent it. some of his other friends condoned it and one even tried to help. apparently, i was only person who told him that it was a mistake. eventurally, he got through his troubles, graduated college shortly after, and now lives with his amazing fiance. it can get better, folks. i can think of very few situations where suicide is the answer.	841	20618	bls9ab	emr5kxk
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	calming down my best friend when they were doing bad in her pre-ap math class and i had a decent grade so i tutored her and she got to a 84 in that class it made me so happy knowing that i helped her	214	20618	bls9ab	emr7rpt
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	after spending much of my 20's asking my dad for financial help, i was finally able to return the favor. dad hit hard times and while i wasn't in great shape either, i paid his mortgage for the month. another time, i reconnected with my high school best friend, and he wasn't doing too well. divorce, lost his job. he didn't ask, but i sent him $100 as a gift to help him power through. maybe i got played, but he wasn't the type before so i doubt it. i don't have many friends, and the ones i do have tend to have the kind of problems i can't physically do anything about. but i help when i can. i don't believe in saying no when someone needs help i can afford to give. i'm no saint either, but at least i know i'm not a total dick.	756	20618	bls9ab	emr3yan
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was 13 i was going to have lunch at the school's bar and this 10yo kid shows up and is talking with his friend about not having money for lunch so i bought him lunch while i had a water bottle (with what i had left) 3 months later he finds me at school randomly around the place and thanks me. felt nice.	187	20618	bls9ab	emr8v8i

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	there was an elderly woman with downs syndrome in the same hospital room as my grandma after she fell and broke her pelvis bone. she couldnt speak english that well as she was very old and sick, but she kept complaining that her leg was hurting and would repeat that and then begin to whimper. it looked as if she was going to cry, so i went over to her and gave her a hug. a huge smile spread across her face, and then i drew her a picture of a dog. for a few moments she forgot about all of her pain and loneliness. brought my mom to tears. edit: a word	683	20618	bls9ab	emr8fwg
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was in basic. we had cadetts from different countries training with us. one of them ended up being in the same room with me. we came along really well. the problem was, that they got paid almost nothing for their time here, our armed forces gave them some pocked money and their own nation didnt pay them for the training time in a foreign country. he had a gf and wanted to propose to her, but could not afford the flight home. i bought the ticket and gave it to him. he refused to accept it for quite a while, until eventually he took it. he proposed to her as he came home for 2 weeks and i am invited to their wedding. his whole family is insanely grateful for the act. we are true bros now after all the shit we went through in training. edit: thanks for the silver kind stranger <3	366	20618	bls9ab	emrjp0u

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i used to work in the visitors clubhouse for a single a baseball team. i'd also help do things on the home side, and during the game if i got what i needed to get done done, i could watch a few innings. all that is to say i didn't spend all my time in the visitor's locker room. after the game was over, one of the visiting players came up and told me he was missing money from his wallet, something like $150. there's very limited access to the clubhouse. besides me and like 1 or 2 other guys, it'd only be members of their team. i didn't want to think any of his teammates did it, and i didn't want to chance wrongly accusing any of my clubhouse coworkers. i ended up just giving him $150 of my own money (the job paid terribly but i got $45 a night for doing the laundry so i had cash on me). i wasn't living paycheck to paycheck or anything, but still. &#x200b; the front office ended up finding out about it, and i got a bunch of coupons for free stuff from businesses who sponsored the team which was nice.	485	20618	bls9ab	emr655m

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"for my best friend's 30th birthday i wanted to give him something awesome because he's been amazing, supportive, and such a positive influence in my life. i wanted something meaningful to show just how much i appreciate him. he's really big into vinyl records, so i decided to have a record made of some of our recordings from when we were in a band together in high school. the front of the album was this really cool picture of our band's name i had painted on my parent's garage that we used as a band picture for this small street festival we played at. the back of the record was a black and white picture of the basement where we used to practice. i took that picture when our friend's parents (he was the drummer) sold the house and we were helping them move stuff out of it. the recordings i chose were from this practice session that i call ""good friday"" because we did it on a good friday we had off of school. it's not the greatest sounding recording we ever did (we used a boombox to record our stuff) but that day we ended writing and recording a song all three of us really liked within the span of like a couple of hours. we were never really great or played many shows, but the time we spent practicing and goofing off in that basement and going to the diner or the mexican restaurant for tacos afterward are some of the happiest memories i have from high school. [here's a picture from when i gave it to him.](https://i.imgur.com/lsvk8ci.jpg) i don't think i will ever be able to top that gift, but it meant so much to me to see how happy it made him."	459	20618	bls9ab	emr81m9
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i met a girl on myspace (this was back in the day) when i was just randomly messaging people that looked interesting. over the course of three days realized she was very suicidal. she had a plan of when and how she would kill herself (that evening) and the method was lethal. i worked as a counselor at the time, so i knew this was incredibly serious. she had written me earlier in the day about her plan. when i saw the messages a few hours later and responded, she did not respond and i freaked out. all i knew was her name and the city she lived in, so i called the police there and they were able to track her through her ip address. while all of this was playing out, it was the longest two hours of my life. they got to her house in time and she was taken to a psychiatric hospital. the police called me to tell me that she was okay and later on her mom called me crying and thanking me. the girl called me after she got out of the hospital and thanked me. she asked me why i cared so much to go through all that to keep her from committing suicide and i was taken aback. i told her she was a person and even though i didn't know her very well, i certainly didn't want her to die and i cared about her. we've hung out a few times and we're still friends on social media. her life has had ups and downs, but man, i'm so glad she's alive to experience it all. i have no doubt she would be dead if i hadn't been randomly messaging people on myspace. for anyone that does not know regarding suicide: when the person has a timeline of when they want to do it, it's serious. when they have a plan of how they would do it and the plan is feasible, it's serious. when the method they are selecting is lethal, it's serious. they need professional help if they are at those points and having all three means they need intervention asap.	896	20618	bls9ab	emr76ye
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	let my scheming cousin borrow my car so he wouldnt continue to scheme my grandparents. fucking asshole. edit: i found out he went to my grandparents for money because my car needed parts three times in two weeks. its an accord and didnt need anything! i made him give it back and now he has no car.	287	20618	bls9ab	emr7fhi
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"my daughter and i were at the mall when i saw a very young boy, think 18-24 months old, trailing behind a group of people. they seemed unaware of his presence but he was intensely focused on them and trying desperately to catch up with them. i found it unusual that they weren't turning to check on him at least. (i assumed one of them was his mom.) finally they pulled far enough ahead of him he recognized he wouldn't be able to catch up and he stopped walking and started crying. the ""mom"" in me kicked in. i held out my arms in the universal ""let me pick you up"" gesture and he immediately raised his arms to allow me pick him up. i did so and power walked as fast as i could to catch up with the group he was following. when i got them to stop i was shocked to find out he wasn't theirs! i'm thinking oh crap?!? who does this baby belong to?!? then a lady at the back of the group recognized him and said she knew his mom but she had no idea they were at the mall that day. we decided to take him back the direction i we all came from and hope for the best. about halfway back through the mall we see mall security with a frantic/distressed woman speaking rapidly in a foriegn language. her approximately 12 year old daughter looking pale and scared nearby. i knew immediately this was the boys mom. i walked up to her, she looked at me confused, then saw her son in my arms. i'll never forget the look of relief on her face as i handed him to her. she hugged him tightly, crying, kissing him, yelling at her daughter. my guess is big sister was supposed to be watching him and didn't pay close enough attention. i gave mom a hug. waived at security and left. hopefully big sister and mom pay closer attention in the future. that could have ended up way worse.

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	(edited to include that yes, i stopped my car in the middle of the street) this is about six steps below nice and falls under being a decent fucking human being. i was driving down a long-ish hill in an urban area a few years ago. no stop signs or signals. there was a crosswalk in the middle of the hill and as i approached, i saw a blind person with a white cane just standing there, i assume waiting to cross. cars were just blowing by. i slowed, stopped in front of the crosswalk (edit: in the middle of the damn street) put car in park/pulled emergency brake, got out, left my damn car door open, and walked over to the person and asked them if i could escort them across the street. and i did. i was so pissed at everyone who did nothing while that poor person stood there, just waiting for someone to be decent.	214	20618	bls9ab	emrjiy6

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i try to do a lot of nice things when no one is looking, it helps me sleep at night. i held my landlord while she cried herself to sleep because her husband left her. i held my best friends brother as his grandmother took her last breath, rubbing his back and telling him she's in a better place now. bought several coworkers, friends and strangers groceries when they've been struggling paycheck to paycheck. someone did that for me once and it meant the world not needing to go hungry until payday. took three separate people into my home when they were struggling, mentally, emotionally or financially so they could get on their feet again. one divorce, one lost their job and one was getting clean of drugs. two of the three turned it around and are doing really well. i've given what i could spare, food or otherwise to homeless people but one in particular that stands out. turns out the guy ran out of gas and was stranded for the better part of a day, pretty much cried when i offered to buy him some gas. i was sitting in a road construction hault, literally in the middle of no where, four hours from any city and i saw an old man hitch hiking. for some reason i had this feeling that i needed to help him (i've never picked up a hitch hiker before). the man was fleeing a fire that destroyed his home, slept on the side of the road and had gone an entire day without water. he was in bad shape. he also grew weed to give to nuns and they turned it into cbd for cancer patients. i find that it's the little things we can do when someone is in need. but what i've done for people has been done for me ten times over by strangers. today you, tomorrow me.	580	20618	bls9ab	emr5ftl

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"about more than 10-11 years ago back when i was a high school senior, i attended a birthday party of a friend of mine at her house. i remember feeling a *little* out of place there as the other teens there were the kind of edgy anime loving, linkin' park listening, [amv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anime_music_video) creating, [kingdom hearts parking lot-ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kifn5nvxu) teens (gamer nerd, wasn't too deep into anime culture then). but, i wasn't the real outcast there. there was a freshman girl there (henceforth she'll be referred to as *bree*) who wasn't well liked apparently. never met her before, but i noticed she was taking a hell of a verbal beating from other girls there for a while (not even sure who these bullies were or why were they invited). from what i've noticed bree seemed to have a kind of personality that would get annoying to others: little whiny, seemingly clumsy, easy to agitate, ""unattractive"" to shallow people. knowing how evil us young li'l shits can be you can easily guess a person like this will be bullied. half way through the day, bree couldn't take the bullying anymore and got into a shouting match with the other girls. this ended up with her storming to the back corner of the back yard, sitting on a swing-set crying. i typically really hate getting into the business of other people because i wasn't too socially confident then but at this point i kinda felt bad. i remember thinking to myself the idea of a party is to have fun and not be miserable so i decided to have a chat with her. sat down to the empty swing next to bree and asked her what's going on. (as linkin park is blasting in the background.) she told me these girls were always talking shit and bullying her for the way she was. told me about how she wanted to be left alone. i explained to bree about the personal bullying i've dealt with for a huge portion of my life at school since 5th grade. told her that i'm a huge black gaming nerd with a short-fuse and thin skin and how this is a terrible combination for bullies to exploit. told her about how fellow black classmates rejected me because i was considered to be ""too white"". told her about pointless fights i've gotten into. i told her it took me til i hit my sophomore year of high school to really understand things and realize what these bullies say to you doesn't matter a lick of shit. how they enjoy getting that rise out of you when you cry and scream back at them. i remember having a reasonably long discussion about how she'll get through this and come out a stronger person and how liberating it is to show off to these bullies how little of a flying fuck you give about what they say. how it feels goooood when you've gained immunity from their shit and watch them make fools of themselves. in the end, [~~it doesn't even matter~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evtxpuf4oz4) bree lightened up and thanked me for helping her feel better. she ended up clinging to me for the rest of that day but i didn't mind. i know how it feels to be alone. i do know the two bullies noticed what happened and made some dumb ""hiding behind your new boyfriend?1"" jokes though i think she took a little of what i said to heart and ignored it. .unfortunately after that party, i never saw her again. hope she's doing well out there. ^(and unfortunately to me, as i write this i realize this was probably the closest in my entire life i've ever been with another female.) tl;dr, fuck bullies, mang. this ended up being much longer than i wanted it to be, but i guess i felt the need to share as i never really talk about this to anyone."	237	20618	bls9ab	emrcc4z

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when my father passed 20 years ago he left me a little money from a life insurance policy. my best friend at the time had three young children and although both her and her husband were working hard, they were struggling. she was waitressing at the time the hours her husband was off work and on weekends at several different restaurants. for christmas i sent her $1,000 cash and signed the note from an anonymous customer from the restaurant. she used the money to buy glasses for her and all three of her children, bills and food. i was there when the package got delivered by some random accident and totally played dumb. she sobbed. she was so grateful. she will never know it was me. i will never tell her. one of her other friends actually stepped forward and took credit for sending her the money and i still kept my mouth shut.	82	20618	bls9ab	emrby43
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	a friend i knew from an internet message board had her kids removed from her house due to issues with cleanliness. she still had custody but they had to live at a hotel (which she could ill afford) until the house was judged fit. she was getting help from a social worker on other issues but the cleaning was overwhelming. she was stressed and panicked and posted about it. she lived about 45 minutes from me. a friend and i went up to her house with all the cleaning supplies we could gather, and some gloves, and left our judgment behind. we just dug in and tackled it. the second nicest thing i did was not go into detail and tell anyone on the message board what the experience was like.	78	20618	bls9ab	emrrn53
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i switched seats on a plane with a little girl who wanted to sit next to her sisters. the woman in that row wouldn't switch seats because it wasn't an aisle seat (it was a window seat). rather than ruin that girl's flight, i switched with the lady who wouldn't move and took the girl's seat so she could sit beside her sisters.	299	20618	bls9ab	emr702c
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"the one rule we all follow in nyc is to keep your eyes down on the subway. no eye contact. but one evening on my commute home, i saw a young woman with a small child and a large suitcase on the l train. she kept glancing around nervously. when she got up to leave at the first ave stop, she lugged the suitcase and kid on to the platform. i knew that station didn't have an elevator, and rather steep stairs. it wasn't my stop, but i hopped off. i leaned down to pretend to tie my shoe and kept my eye on them. i didn't want to freak her out. she got to the stairs, and looked around. i pretended like i'd only just noticed her predicament as i walked up. i noticed she had a bruise on her face. i offered to help, and she let me carry her suitcase up the stairs. she thanked me, and i started to leave. but something made me pause and turn around. i asked her if she needed any help getting to her destination. she nodded. i didn't ask her any questions as i walked with her and the kid to an apartment nearby. we didn't talk. i think she maybe said 10 words to me. i didn't need to know her story. i left, with a small ""have a nice night"". i walked directly into a bar on the corner, ordered a drink, and cried quietly to myself for about 5 minutes."	158	20618	bls9ab	emrnq8h
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	after rehab a woman my age (young adult) and i took the shuttle to the airport together. they dropped us off at the same place and i was helping her with luggage and boxes probably more than i should have, but i had 3 hours to kill and could use something to do. when she had to pay to fedex an overweight box to home she went white and realized she left her purse on the shuttle provided by the rehab. it had her phone and wallet and everything she needed. she was panicking really hard so i was able to kind of keep cool and start problem solving. we used my phone and i stayed nearby and we called everywhere we could (for some reason nobody was answering us despite giving us all these numbers for support lol). we got in touch with the shuttle who reluctantly circled around to drop her purse off. we had a smoke and i saw her off. i thought she was really cute too but i also didn't dare ask to keep in touch or for a number. it could be a cool meeting story but we both just left rehab and she was still flustered so i just said take care and left. she would have been okay without me, but i'm sure it helped that i was a familiar face and had some phone numbers with me instead of just asking a stranger, calling her friends to do it and not knowing if the purse would show up or not.	155	20618	bls9ab	emr5x8x
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was sitting on a bench on football field all alone. it wasn't even a game on no-one around. no wonder, it was still 6am. a random older guy came to me while he was walking his dogs. he was swearing and shouting at me that i have nothing to do there (even that it was public place). he yelled that i just leave garbage around while showing me the garbage on the ground. of course i didn't do anything like that, i was just harmlessly sitting there minding my own business. he kicked me out of there and there left. i was angry because he kicked me out of public place, but also felt sorry because the field was quite big and there was a lot of garbage. when i made sure he wasn't around i sneaked there and cleaned the whole place while he was gone. i wasn't there from that day. i hope he was happy that he didn't have to deal with that garbage himself.	440	20618	bls9ab	emr37zi

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"i don't think it's the nicest thing i've ever done for someone, but their response was the nicest i've ever felt before. i met a girl at a wedding who had apparently been dumped that day by her boyfriend. i didn't know this at the time. i just thought she was beautiful, and when she started talking i wanted to hear more. so we talked through the night. then that weekend i caught up with her again and we went out for ice cream, and then we hooked up for a while, ended up cuddling on a couch deep into the morning. she got up to drive back to her house but before she did, she hugged me and said: ""thank you for helping me out of a dark place this week."" her voice was muffled in my shirt, but i remember how those words sounded, how her voice vibrated into my shirt, how she felt hugging me, and having that feeling is still a top 5 moment of my entire life. i fell in love with her, hard, but it turned out i was just a rebound for her. we have stayed friends and talk sometimes but. i wish every day that i could make her feel the way she made me feel that night."	137	20618	bls9ab	emroinq
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	a girl i used to hook up with when i was a in my early twenties sister died suddenly from an aneurysm. me and this girl never hung out outside of parties and we had a weird physical only relationship but when i found out her sister died i reached out to her and asked if i could do anything for her. she wanted to come to my farm and shoot guns (this was about 3 days after her sister died). i brought out a bunch of shit for her to shoot and a baseball bat and a pretty big old tube tv for her to smash. i'll never forget watching her tiny 100 lb frame sobbing and swinging at that tv with a baseball bat until she collapsed in the grass. i pulled the a blanket over her and she laid her head in my lap and cried for what seemed like hours. we didn't really talk during any of it and i kind of just facilitated what she wanted to do. 5 years later when my older brother died all i wanted was someones lap to lay my head on and for everyone to shut up and let me be still. it was then that i realized how special what i did for her was. i ran into her last year at a bar when i was visiting my hometown and she broke down and told me how much what i did meant to her and we ended up crying together on the bench outside the bar and just sat there with her head on my shoulder being still together. it meant the world to me that night because hardly anyone understands the importance of just being there, with nothing to say.	136	20618	bls9ab	emrygtn
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	flipping the question around. nicest thing ever done for me was at an amusement park when i was 7-8 years old. i was crying because i couldn't win any prizes at the carnival games when an older boy came up with three little stuffed animals he had won and told me i could pick one to keep. i'll never forget that moment of kindness from a complete stranger and to this day 15+ years later i still have that stuffed animal.	68	20618	bls9ab	emrf1lk
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	not me but my basketball coach gets to school two hours early to welcome in a homeless student, get him a change of athletic clothes, and lets him shower in the locker room. he also buys him breakfast and lunch everyday. because of my coach, no one knows this student is homeless and he doesnt have to be embarrassed about looking dirty or smelling bad.	64	20618	bls9ab	emrhmo1
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i have a chronic illness that landed me in the hospital one time. i shared a room with an elderly woman who had rheumatoid arthritis and her fingers, hands, legs etc were all deformed such that she couldnt physically move properly. throughout the stay i noticed that she was very poor and didnt have much people visiting her and her son refused to visit her as well. she soon got moved to a rehabilitation centre. after i got better, i looked her up and visited her at the center. we developed a friendship and i kept visiting her. i would buy her new and warm clothes for winter and also give her a bit of money to buy some better food for her and her bedridden husband. sometimes i would wheel her downstairs in her wherlchair so she could catch some fresh air. im now her god-daughter and she treats me like the daughter she never had. i only wish to give this lady a happier life.	63	20618	bls9ab	emrzc0n

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was in my early 20's, a young woman around my age crashed her car into my workplace and died in the parking lot. it was pretty traumatic on all fronts. a few days later, one of her brothers came by and asked to speak with anyone who had witnessed the crash. he just wanted some closure on his sister's last moments. i spoke with him for a long time, and found that the girl who died was a mother of three children - the youngest being just two weeks old. she had severe post-partum depression, and it is thought that the crash may have been intentional on her part. this hit me so hard, having suffered with severe depression and suicidal thoughts myself, and the girl being my age. the children went to live with the girl's mother, who already had several other children at home to support. they were very, very poor. i helped them with fundraising enough to barely scrape together a modest funeral service. this happened in the summer, and i stayed in touch with the girl's mother and brother periodically to see how they were doing. around christmas time, i thought of all those kids living with the mother, and how they would have nothing. at the time, my own parents were still budgeting a fair amount for christmas presents for me - i think it was around $200. that year, i asked them if i could just use the money to buy gifts and clothes for those children. so i did. i did the same every year after that for four years, until i stopped hearing back from the girl's mother. i'm not sure what happened to her, or why she stopped responding. but i never heard from her again. i still wonder how those kids are doing. and i still can't pass a car accident on the road, even a minor one, without breaking down and losing my shit. rip kendra.	56	20618	bls9ab	emrngoo
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my mom had to file bankruptcy a couple years ago after she split with my pops. she was living with her mom with bills out her ass & couldnt seem to get back on her feet. at the time i was living across country so i called my grandma asking for the banking info & paid off the $10,000+ that day. she still to this day doesnt know, & thinks the bank made an error on the amount of debt she owed or something like that. always dreamt of helping my mom out somehow & will continue to do so, but it was an awesome feeling knowing i helped her get back on her feet & in her own place again! 	54	20618	bls9ab	emry28y

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i live in a small town with a lot of filipino people coming here for work. the locals dont mind them but arent fully welcoming either. my girlfriends sister lives in an apartment building and as we were leaving one day, a filipino dude was struggling to get a massive piece of furniture up a flight of stairs. his wife was there but pregnant so couldnt help him much. i saw him struggling to pull it up the stairs so i grabbed the bottom and help carry it up. he was panting so hard from moving he could barely say thank you but his wife was thanking me endlessly. i asked if there was anything else i could do but they said that was the last of the furniture for today and thanked me again. the guy was moving huge pieces of furniture all day, killing himself doing it and nobody volunteered to help him. i guarantee if it was white boy me moving alone and somebody saw me, the whole town would band together to move my shitty couch. i still see them sometimes in the building and theyre the friendliest couple youd ever meet. they still thank me for that little bit of help i gave them. i guess even a small act can have a big impact.	310	20618	bls9ab	emr6m4e

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	last week i was at the tulum ruins in mexico. there was a woman sitting on a bench in tears struggling to breathe. i went over and asked her if she was ok. turns out she was having an asthma attack and was left behind by her tour. she then had a panic attack because she was going to miss her trolley back to the bus and then ultimately her cruise ship. she was traveling alone. i stayed with her and talked to her to calm her down. after 10 minutes i carried her bag while me and another guy walked her to the trolley with time to spare. she cried and hugged us both. i hope you made it home safe, rhonda from alabama.	51	20618	bls9ab	emrqbo9
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	back in college i lived in a small, laidback fraternity. most of the guys were farmers so thursday was our party night, and then everyone went home for the weekend so generally friday and saturday nights were quiet. well one saturday night i was up in my room working on home work around 10 at night. i ran outside to get my phone charger for my car and found a random girl laying in the middle of our parking lot, obviously too drunk to function. i walked over, and she was randomly touching her phone and then putting it to her ear and yelling her roommates name. i helped her up and set her on the stairs outside the house and started trying to get ahold of someone who knew her. i was trying to get her to call someone, but she could barely talk so i finally grabbed her phone and called stephanie who i presumed was her roommate. she answered and i said hey stephanie this is seth. i live near campus at farmhouse fraternity and i think i have your friend here. can you come get her? now to put this into perspective i am 61 250lbs bearded guy with a pretty deep voice. the roommate was obviously drunk as well, and yelled over the music julie!? youre drunk! and hung up on me. about that time her phone died so i plugged it into my car so i could try other friends. i turned around and she was pulling her shorts down and pissing all over our steps. girl was a fucking train wreck. finally her phone powered up and i just started going through her messages and started calling random people. finally got ahold of a girl who lived a few blocks away from the house, and she agreed to come get her. ended up carrying this girl down the street back to her friends house. it was an interesting night.	44	20618	bls9ab	emrxzmv

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i don't know if it was the nicest thing but i felt really happy doing it. i was by myself on a 10 hour flight back home . when i got to my seat i realized that i was given the best seat in coach. you know that seat they sell or give to mothers with babies that doesnt have anyone in front of you. you can get up whenever you want and not worry about being squished by the person next to you. my dream seat. as the plane was about to take off an older woman was sitting with her adult daughter. the seat next to me was empty (i was extra happy about that). the daughter asked the flight attendant if her mother could move to the seat next to me because her legs were bothering her and she had poor circulation. the flight attendant said yes but that she had to wait until the plane was in the air and seat belt signs came off. when that time came, the woman attempted to get up to move but a young woman who appeared extremely nauseous or just sick beat her to the seat. when they told the flight attendant that that was supposed to be for her mom, they were told oh well she got there first. basically i just told them to take my seat. i sat with the daughter and the older lady was so happy. they were so happy and couldn't believe someone would give up their seat like that. there's no way i could have stayed in my seat and rested knowing that lady really needed it. made my day.	41	20618	bls9ab	emrbn41
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	woman was caught stealing a little over $250 worth of merchandise by loss prevention at a local big box store a few weeks before christmas. she ended up having a pretty extensive history of theft unfortunately. she was crying and telling me about how her husband is a controlling drunk that doesnt give her access to their bank accounts. i looked at all the merchandise she attempted to steal. every single thing was essentials for her kids. snow pants, boots, gloves, and some toiletrys. after giving her the citation for theft(which i have no choice on because the store wished for her to prosecuted), i bought everything and then a toy for each of her kids. total was a little over $400. i then contacted and got her in touch with a victim advocate to try and get her into a better situation. ive bought stuff in the past for people down on their luck, but this was by far the most ive ever spent.	37	20618	bls9ab	emru5jy
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was a teenager, i saw a little girl walking across the road near my house when a jeep was heading towards her. i ended up pushing the kid out of the way but got hit by the jeep and shattered my right wrist. kid went home crying, no sight of her mom or dad, and i ended up going to emergency because fuck that hurt.	34	20618	bls9ab	emrya62
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my college used to be ten minutes walk from my home. i used to walk there daily and see an old homeless lady on the way. i used to give her some coins and a smile whenever i saw her. you may not believe in this, but whenever i used to see the lady, my day turned into a lucky day like a blessing. my end semester exams were approaching and i wish i could have taken her blessings for my exams. but she was nowhere to be seen. she represented an occurrence in my everyday routine that made me feel happy. however, as soon as my exam started, i saw her again everyday and fortunately my exams went well! finally, at the end of my exam days, i took her to a tea shop. the tea shop owner gave us tea in two cups. as soon as i gave the tea to the lady, the shopkeeper asked me not to give her the cup and that hell provide a plastic disposable glass for her. he started snatching the cup from the old lady. i didnt like that and i asked what happened. he wanted to explain but he didnt have any real reason to say. i realized he was biased towards her because of her appearance. i told him she is a human being like us and certainly can drink tea cup. you should have seen the smile on her face and others around us. what a lovely day. i hope she's okay.	35	20618	bls9ab	emrz70t
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i went to highschool with someone who was on the spectrum, and had some trouble making friends. we weren't close at all, but knew each other purely because we went to a small school. fast forward about 6 years, and i see a post on their social media where they mentioned how they're down on luck. they needed to move apartments, but recently had surgery so they couldn't lift anything or pack for themselves. they didn't have any friends willing to help, and couldn't afford a moving company. i sent them a message, drove over and packed, then moved, their entire apartment across town for them. they tried to pay me what they could, but i just asked them to pay it forward. we still stay in touch!	32	20618	bls9ab	ems55rz

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	this probably isn't the nicest thing, but it's very memorable. i once had this old guy, he religiously used to walk to the pizza place near my house most nights, i'd be biking around and see him and just feel sad because of how lonely he was. as well, he also used to sit on a bench not too far from the shops (about a block away) and drink, which is where i saw him a lot too. one night i'm at the shop, he comes out with two bags full of stuff, i offer to carry them for him, and to my pleasant surprise he accepts. trailing my bike whilst carrying his bags, we engaged in a blunt conversation, he told me pieces of his life and how he was in a war (i can't remember what because my memory is awful). i walked him back to the bench, where we sat and talked some more. then i walked him back to his care home. i never saw him out much after this, and after a while i hadn't seen him for months. this was three years ago, he's most likely passed now, but it's still a pleasant memory.	31	20618	bls9ab	emre7b9
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"my big sister had a bad time, for like months, and she was still shocked by my father's death (although a year was already passed) so when she wanted to sleep i just went and kissed her forehead, while getting out of the room she just said ""hug please"" then i hugged her, her mood got better for weeks."	31	20618	bls9ab	emrhyh5

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i accidentally bought two front row tickets to miley cyrus/hannah montana concert years ago for my brother and cousin, thinking they were $500+ together and 5th row-center. turns out i spent $1000 dollars and my parents had already bought them tickets. i started to try and get it refunded immediately, but then, for reasons i honestly cant explain because i was always rather selfish, i wanted to do something good. i called around to some of the local childrens hospitals and one had two terminally ill little girls who were obsessed about miley and this tour. we discussed how to go about donating so i gave them all the information to pass along to the parents. not long after, the hospital called and asked if i would be willing to meet with the parents because they wanted to meet me. i though sure, why not? i never anticipated how much that would change my life. i met both those girls and their parents. we smiled, laughed, and cried together. i later got a thank you letter from them with a picture of both the girls together which i still have today. it reminds me why i try to be a better person everyday.	30	20618	bls9ab	emsenj1
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my mom's best friend since teenage years (i considered her an aunt) has always lived a financially struggling life, but she has been one of my best friends for as long as i can remember. about 2 years ago, she decided to go to a job somewhere out of state. i'm not fully aware of how the training was, but it was to become a truck driver for a company. anyways, i was making decent money as a server and was able to manage my bills while enjoying life at times. when she was in training, her food/clothes that was supposed to be sent to her were being delayed, so she had no money and nothing to eat. she started a gofundme for $500 to be able to survive the next couple weeks. when i noticed the gofundme on facebook, i saw she only raised $150, so i sent her the remaining $300. today, she is much happier and making good money driving trucks, and stops in town every so often to hang out with me.	61	20618	bls9ab	emr9bag
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"in my line of work working with mentally disabled people i've done a lot of good things. but i think the nicest thing i've done was for selfish reasons. i was at the store behind a woman and her 2 kids when she had to run to get something else. i was just grabbing a soda and pre made sub sandwich before my shift and i was in a hurry. since her kids were super polite (yes sir, no sir, thank you) i decided to pay for her groceries. my bill's were paid and i had $300 in my account. i walked up without looking at the total, told her to add my two things then paid for everything that had been scanned and bagged already, (everything but the items the mom ran for). the total was $294 and change. the little boy who was 12 or so asked me why. i quickly gathered my 2 items and said something along the lines of ""random acts of kindness help restore faith in our broken humanity"", and then walked out. while getting into my car i could see mom crying and looking around the parking lot, the cashier pointing out the window. i drove off with a smile on my face knowing i helped out a mother of atleast 2, but i also got out of the store quicker so i wasn't late to work."	64	20618	bls9ab	emrlj4c
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was about 14 (almost 16 years ago now) i was at a local park and this little girl (6 or 7) was walking her small maltese looking dog. a guy came in with these 2 massive dogs off their leashes. as soon as these other dogs spotted the smaller one, they attacked it. the small dog was running circles around the little girl, tangling her in its leash. i marched over between them told her to drop the leash and carried her over to some bleachers and burried her head in my chest and told her not to look and plug her ears. her family lived next door to the park, heard the commotion and came running. the guy ditched his dogs and took off, the little girls family chasing after. someone in her family came and took her from me and i walked home without a word. i wonder about her some times. amazingly, i heard the little dog lived from some of my neighbors.	127	20618	bls9ab	emr7gut

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	was driving through a neighborhood and came across an old woman unconscious on her driveway. she came around once i walked up to her. looked like she fainted and fell face first onto the concrete. she didnt want to go to the hospital but i convinced her to let me call her doctor who had an office just a few blocks away. ended up physically carrying her into the office from my car because she was too unstable to walk. she didnt have any family locally so the doctors office took care of her then called me to pick her up a few hours later. took her home and got a sweet grandma hug from her. that was years ago and i never saw her again. but i still remember her name almost 30 years later.	30	20618	bls9ab	emru4au
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was walking home from a convenience store and saw this woman on her hands and knees in front of her car, looking for something in her handbag. it seemed like she was struggling. i almost walked past like everyone else but decided to go check if she was okay. she was shaking a lot. she told me she was looking for her car keys in her bag just before pulling them out. she then struggled to get up so i gave her a hand and asked if there's anything else i can do. the woman asked if i could put her shopping bags in the passenger seat of her car, so i did. then she asked if i could put her crutches in there too, so i picked them up and started walking round to the other side of her car. i quickly glanced at some text on her crutches and read the words '.parkinsons charity.'! it all made sense now, the reason why she was shaking so much and struggling to stand up on her own. i'm glad i was able to help her, and she seemed very grateful for it.	27	20618	bls9ab	emrx4zz
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	eight or so years ago i was taking my dog for a walk on a sunday morning and passed an older woman - probably in her 80s - waiting for a city bus to go to church. when i passed back by her a half an hour later she was still waiting. what she did not know was that the bus service on that street had been canceled for that morning because of the big marathon that was running through our city. i let her know that and she started to walk home, defeated. i ran after her and offered to drive her to church. ended up jogging back home, getting my car, going back to pick her up and then driving her to her church about 7 miles away.	28	20618	bls9ab	emrxz51
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i normally keep stuff like this to myself but yeah i've done my fair share of helping other people. the most recent one i had was around 3 weeks ago. end of the month so kinda running broke. happen to take the metro instead of public bus that day. i had around 300 rupees {5 usd roughly). a family approached me - a couple with 3 small kids. they were obviously in a very shitty condition, clothes torn, the typical below poverty line family. i was standing at the ticket counter and was alone at the time because i had just gotten back from my training. the mom was crying and seeing them in an instant told me that yeah they really needed help. so i buy the family all metro tickets to get to wherever they are going and gave them the rest of all the money i had for food. seeing the dad cry and tell me that this was the best thing someone has ever done for them, him pouring his eyes out telling me this gave me this unexplainable sense of satisfaction that i indeed just helped someone who so desperately wanted the support. i've been in situations in the past where things weren't going so smooth and putting myself in this family's shoes and feeling their struggles gave me the best sleep i've ever had in a while. hope that family is doing well.	29	20618	bls9ab	emrzi75
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was working with an ex refugee family helping them settle into their new life. we were unpacking their belongings and setting up their new house. the mother unpacked a photo frame with a photo of her murdered husband in it. it was the only photo she had of her husband and her children's father it got cracked in transit, the glass was smashed. she cried and we had a hug, we didn't speak the same language. i took it to a photoshop and got it enlarged the photo got digitally restored and i got a beautiful new frame. when she opened it for christmas we all cried it was easy for me to do that ( maybe $20-$30) but it seemed like a big deal for her and her children.	28	20618	bls9ab	ems4eew
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i saw a young girl standing outside a gas station in heavy rain. i asked if she needed a ride (in the least creepy way possible) and found out she was supposed to be at a shelter for young girls but ran away with her friend who left her behind when she didn't want to go with these 2 much older men that offered to take them across state lines (human trafficking is a problem in this area too so extra bad sign). she didn't want to go back because she was on her last strike before she got juvenile detention. i asked her when she last ate and gave her a change of clothes out of my car. i bought her whatever she wanted from the gas station and made some calls while she ate. we talked about the shelter and how bad it was but going back, even back to detention, is way better than out on the streets. you could tell from the way she talked she had been through way more than a kid her age should go through. i still worry about her.	25	20618	bls9ab	ems4fl5
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	stayed awake on the phone using my credit for 6 hours to keep my friend from committing suicide. it was more for myself because i couldn't bear to lose her, but i think it was something nice. i do this quite frequently now, and i think it benefits me highly as i want a career in psychology (starting university in 9 months!!!)	25	20618	bls9ab	ems74a0
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"i worked at grocery store a few years ago, and one day this mother and her daughter(about the same age as me) came in to get their grocery haul. we chatted as i scanned all their stuff, and they were honestly really great people. when it came up to get the total, she pulled out her ebt card to pay. now at that time, our system wasn't accepting ebt payment, so i explained that to the mother, and she suddenly looked very defeated, and borderline tearing up. i asked if there was another way they could pay, and she told me that they don't have any other money. i empathized with her very much, as i've been in that situation before with my own mother, not having any money to buy food and having to rely on food stamps. so i looked around to see if any of my coworkers were in earshot, and i looked back at her and said ""don't worry about it, you're good to go."" i remember the look in her eyes, those tears went from defeat to amazement, and she had the biggest smile on her face as i assured her i would take care of the total. she thanked me profusely, and she even asked me ""are you single? because my daughter is"" lol. no one from that job ever knew what i did, but honestly it was the best i've ever felt and i would absolutely do it again if i had to."	31	20618	bls9ab	emsd6df
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	when i was in college, i was off campus at a friends place heading home, about 25 minutes drive, and i see 4 college age kids at a bus stop at 12:30, last bus was 30 minutes ago, so i told them, confirmed they were going to campus, and gave em a ride to campus. saw 1 of them 3 years later and he thanked me profusely.	25	20618	bls9ab	emrcyon
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	the nicest? that is subjective. help people that are stranded on the side of the road. buy food & drink for homeless people outside of the gas station by my work. buy good food for the food bank either on thanksgiving or christmas. buy peoples food behind me especially if they look like they are having a shitty day. little things. i'm not super excited about interacting with people, so it's usually things that i can get in and get out without a bunch of talking.	52	20618	bls9ab	emr5xnz

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	not me but a friend of mine i served with back in the day. an ex girlfriend of his was in trouble. they had boinked when he came back from deployment for a few days and she kinda dropped off the face of the earth. about a week after that, he noticed her number on backpage. basically a number for a hooker. so he called the number and she sounded drugged up as all hell. so he learns that she was hooked on drugs, and her pimp was prostituting her and not paying her. so he calls the cops and says he heard a commotion in the hotel he was staying at and the hotel management weren't doing anything. as soon as he hangs up the call he busted through the pimps' door, beats the shit out of both of them, finds out they has a network of 12 girls working for them(also hooked on drugs) and he gets his ex out before cops come. idk what happened to the pimps but he took the girl to a doctor friend of his to get her checked out. turns out she was pregnant too. he contacted her mom who lived in a different part of the state and she's been living with her mom since. she's better now. my friend is a civilian now and living his best life.	23	20618	bls9ab	ems17gl
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	we never told anyone but our kids. but a few years ago, my husband and i had a really bad year. bad financial issues, almost split up; it was just horrible. that christmas a next door neighbor whom we had just met gave me a card with a 200 dollar visa prepaid in it. i cried and thanked her- she told me a story of when she was younger and in tough times, someone left her a note and 200 dollars in her mailbox, saying to pass it on sometime. the following year we had straightened out and decided to pay money to someones christmas layaway. we did so at walmart- and we fumbled a bit because it was something we had never done, and im sure we werent explaining it well, but when the lay away lady understood what we were trying to do, tears welled in her eyes and she dug through her records for a certain person that stood out for her. it was not a bunch of video games- it was a layaway for baby clothes and toys, dolls, high chairs and bedding. this person was several days behind. instead of 200 bucks, we just decided to pay the whole thing off. when the employed asked if we wanted to leave our name or a message, we shrugged and just said  merry christmas. best feeling ever	23	20618	bls9ab	emsdsm7
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i am generally a good listener, so maybe listen to my friends when they are going through tough times? it feels kind of weird to me to choose though, because i am not always sure sure how (and to what level) others perceive my actions as nice	70	20618	bls9ab	emqzp9e
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	a few days after i got poison ivy all over my arms and legs, i ran into the backwoods of my fiancees neighborhood to catch her cat in the pouring rain.

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	paid all his bills, paid his creditors off, took care of bank accounts in the negative, paid off his credit cards, took care of his car insurance so it did not lapse. moved all of his things back to his parents house. because he's my best friend and his cheating girlfriend left him while he was in jail for a crime he didn't commit. she maxed out all his credit cards, overdrafts his bank accounts, oh and cashed in his 401k, because she was his power of attorney. then she bailed. note this was after she hussled 2500 dollars from me because i was also helping lay his rent.	39	20618	bls9ab	emrdw34

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	coming home from work one very late night (2am). just got done with a 10 hr shift at the bakery i worked at. i was one exit away when something flew past me at incredible speeds. i came around a bend and saw a red pickup flipped over. i approached the truck and yelled if he was ok, he just moaned, my arm. my adrenaline started pumping. i told him to hang on. as soon as i was about to put in park. bam. a car smashes into him and spins him 520 degrees around. so i put my high beams on and block his lane fully illuminating his truck. i jump out, i precede to break his driver side window with my knife(that i always have on me) and 2 other bystanders run over. i tell them to grab him and i cut his seat belt off and slowly dragged em out. his leg was broken and his arm. i sat him down and i kept him talking till paramedics arrive about 10 min later. he was a nice old man, i even went back(crawled) into his truck to get his wallet, a couple satchels and his pool sticks.the car that slammed into him was cited for dui. hit him so hard he flipped over. ffs. i got to testify on his behalf. i didnt get to sleep till about 5am. adrenaline was going hard. no one even attempted to stop and help till i risked it all. im an army veteran, i am happy to help.	19	20618	bls9ab	emsd19a
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	late to the party, and i'm not sure this qualifies, but here goes: i saw a young girl sitting on a set of train tracks on my way to practice. there were a bunch of guys just standing around wondering what they should do. i told them to call the police and watch my gear, and ran over to her to talk. she was waiting for the train that was slowly approaching to run her over. at this point it was coming at a somewhat disconcerting speed, but i decided i would stay with her one way or another. i wasn't looking forward to the idea of having to fight this girl in order to get her off the tracks, but if it came to that, so be it.i was trained never to leave anyone behind. the engineer on the train was a bit of an ass and wouldnt stop despite the police and a union pacific employee ordering him to do so (he clearly refused over the radio, despite informing us he could with room to spare) i managed to get her to get off the tracks, and helped her to a waiting police car. after giving a statement, i grabbed my gear and headed to practice like any other day. i havent told anyone i know about this because i dont think its appropriate.	20	20618	bls9ab	ems4xe5
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	one day my car wouldnt start after loading it with groceries. figured i needed a jump as the battery was old so i called my wife and waited. while waiting, i noticed an older woman struggling with loading her groceries. so i helped her load up her groceries and went back to my car. figured id give the car another shot and it started right up. definitely had *car*ma on my side that day.	18	20618	bls9ab	emsd52x

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	against better judgment, i allowed my brother to move into my new home with me and my wife in 2009 after he had just lost his job. unfortunately for me, he was a way worse drug addict and thief than i realized and it took a huge financial blow to me having to replace stuff i had before i realized. after that, i became more jaded and came up with a set of rules about who i will help and when. it made me far more resilient to trusting people, which has helped me avoid the pitfalls of common scams and schemes. it was a great learning experience.	124	20618	bls9ab	emr35hm
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"most recent at the very least. my grammy and i bought lunch for the guy at the table next to us. he was alone and it quickly became apparent he was deaf. he had his order written down on a piece of paper next to him and when he'd want to get their attention he'd grunt a little and wave his hand. one of the bus boys signed to him but i only saw him speak to the old man once. but it was when he asked for desert by pointing i got the urge to pay. he was smiling. he was so jovial and happy. the workers were so kind to him and understanding. the way he jumped up and down a little in his chair when they confirmed his desert made me happy. when i left i told the waitress that if he asked about it to tell him to ""just keep smiling."""	17	20618	bls9ab	emrllnt
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i once gave away a car as a christmas present. it was my '83 mazda. had a friend that didn't have a car, needed one for school and work purposes and i was having a hard time selling it, and it was wasting away in the driveway, so i figured fuck it, you know. put it to some use.	19	20618	bls9ab	emrtvby

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my sister (sorority/best friend, no blood relation) called me at 9 p.m. about a year ago, and told me she was being admitted to a mental health facility and she needed me to be there. it was the day before her birthday, and her parents were out of the country and her sibling was still underage/unavailable at the time. she'd been having problems with her so at the time, they'd been together for forever and had moved in together as the next step in their relationship and to say things weren't going well is a massive understatement. they were going through couples therapy to try and work things through, but it wasn't helping. she was having very bad episodes with her mental health and feared she was going to commit suicide. so i packed her favorite snacks, some clothes, and myself into my car and drove over. as it turns out the only other person willing to be there at the time to help her check in was her so, and it was not a good thing for him to be there. it was too toxic. so she and i sat in the intake room for over two hours together talking through the events leading to this point, just talking in general, getting her professor's names and contacting our campus to get her an advocate/dean who could help manage the situation, and once midnight hit, celebrating her birthday before she was admitted and taken to her room. since her family wasn't available i was named as an advocate/guardian/witness temporarily until her family could return and take over for her care (we were both over 18). she spent two weeks in the facility, and i visited as much was allowed, communicated to her advocate/dean as much as i could and helped rearrange the schedules so she could complete her work and semester. i helped keep her parents updated on her progress, and when she was eventually released, i helped her move out of her and so's place and back to her parent's house. unluckily for her trying to find the right prescriptions was a bit of a challenge in the following weeks as she had a few bad reactions and i had to rush her to urgent care/er more than once. even more unluckily, while in the facility her so had decided to cheat on her and then break up with her the day after she was cleared and released. it was a rough few weeks. she and i are only a year and a half apart in age and at the time i was graduating from undergrad, applying to grad school, managing an organization, dealing with my research projects, and just trying to keep my in head above water. but knowing she needed me, it was an easy choice to give her the support she needed over my own stuff. she's doing very well now, set to graduate soon, a wonderful new so who respects her and treats her well, her family and friends have rallied around her, she's my best friend and sister in every sense of the words. i'm very excited to watch her accept that diploma because she was so certain at one point that she'd never make it here. she's my hero and i'm so proud of her. edit: words.	17	20618	bls9ab	emry2sw

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	had a man come up to me outside a local pizza place when i was 17. he looked ragged and totally emaciated. he asked if i had some spare cash so he could eat (pizza place was cheap and good). i said sure and handed him a $50 gift card my dad had gotten me for my birthday. at 17 that's all the money in the world. literally a month of pizza with friends. i got in my car and while waiting for a friend to show up, i could see an argument inside the store. there was a dispute between the guy and the girl behind the register. i went in and asked what the problem was. was the gift card empty? had i unintentionally been an asshole? no. the guy had tried to buy a ridiculous amount of beer. the pizza place didn't sell to him because he had no id on him (and was obviously a homeless trouble maker) and he got *angry*. he got kicked out. i told her i had given him the card (she saw the exchange happen) and asked for it back. i got him a large pizza and handed it to him outside when it was ready. went back to my car and watched him toss in in the dumpster without taking a bite.	36	20618	bls9ab	emrauc6
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	probably saving a life. i was 20, at university, and had just finished my lecture and walked home when i decided i was going to food shopping since i had finished at 1pm. so i drive to the shop, park up and go in. the place was busy and i was walking up the first isle near the back when all of a sudden a woman started high pitch screaming & shouting in a different language. i turn to my right and she is pointing at a baby her husband is holding belly down. nobody moved. i ran over and you could tell the baby was choking. i basically slapped the baby's back and the piece of crisp came shooting out. the woman was so thankful, literally hugging me. i have super bad anxiety, so i literally was like its fine and basically ran out the shop, leaving my basket. they both came out as i got to my car door and was so thankful, the baby was fine, back to her happy self. afterward, i sat in my car for a good 20 minutes shaking, going through the whole scene in my head. i really started to worry if i had slapped the back of the baby too hard and ended up hurting her from dislodging the crisp. but thankfully, her dad had checked her over and she was fine.	36	20618	bls9ab	emrqayv
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	there was a young couple- in maybe their late teens- with a small baby at the mall getting pictures with santa. it was clearly their little ones first santa picture. their stroller looked a bit tatty and the parents looked a bit worse for wear. i was standing nearby doing bell-ringing for charity when i overheard them discussing in line how they could only get the one picture. while they were getting the picture taken i paid for the biggest set of pictures the place provided and quietly went back to my post. i remember seeing the mom going through change in her purse when the photo person stopped her. i'm assuming telling them the pictures were paid for. the parents teared up. they came back to the booth 10 minutes later and took their big envelope of pictures with huge smiles on their faces. i hope everyone they know got a picture!	16	20618	bls9ab	emrvci2
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was at a gas station at around 7:30 at night. i was just coming home from work and i needed to fill my tank for the morning. i got out of my car, put my debit card info in, and start filling my tank. i then look to my right to see my ex girlfriend who was crying on the curb by the coffee shop. i havent spoke to her in years. i approached her and asked her what was the matter. she was surprised and excited to see me at the same time. she said she was on a date with the boy she was dating (who was known to be a jerk) she went inside to get something to drink while he was putting gas and he left without her. we both doubted it was unintentional so i helped her up and told her ill take her home. she lived 20 minutes away so it wasnt bad. when we got to her house she profusely thanked me and insisted we get back in touch, not as boyfriend and girlfriend but as good friends. i was more then fine with that.	16	20618	bls9ab	emrxpcn
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i found someone collapsed on the side of the road and called 911, administered cpr and also mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance got there. she had turned blue and wasnt breathing and had vomit and a swollen tongue obstructing her airway. i turned her on her side, scooped out the vomit, pried her teeth apart and started switching between cpr & mouth-to-mouth. at one point she bit my hand. eventually i her breathing again and the paramedics, administered a defibrillator, and took her to the hospital. her daughter, who was there when this all happened and was too hysterical to call an ambulance, got my number on the scene before they left for the hospital. i received a message two weeks later saying that her mum was recovering from a cardiac arrest and that she couldnt thank me enough for saving her life.	17	20618	bls9ab	emrylk3
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i work in a supermarket. years ago an elderly lady was too late for the public transit bus and it was after dark, so i convinced a manager to let me punch out and drive her home. turns out we were practically neighbors.	17	20618	bls9ab	emrzjfd
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	ever? i don't know about that, but a couple of years ago, i had an insanely delayed flight into columbus, oh -- weather was screwy, so my flight into dayton was cancelled (i had meetings in cin and dayton, but was going to spend the night in cincinnati). anyway, got into cmh around 1, managed to find a rental car, and saw this young couple trying to get \*themselves\* to dayton. i offered them a ride. now, it probably only added 45 minutes to an hour or so to my drive-time to go via dayton rather than direct to cin, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but the hour was pretty damned late. could have easily said no without much guilt, but did so anyway. fortunately, ohio has civilized alcohol laws so the hotel was able to sell me a couple of beers when i arrived at 3:30am.	15	20618	bls9ab	emrczt1
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	my girlfriend in high school and i had a bad falling out. she was the one who officially ended it, while i was trying to work things out. after the break up, the first class we had the next day was with each other. i sat behind her, and one of her friends normally sat to the left of her. in my table group i had four or five of my really good friends. i was happy to joke around with them and take my mind off of her- who i still felt upset with and kinda humiliated by after the dump (it was my first time on the dumped end of things). anyway, my then exs friend who usually sat by her called in sick that day. after my third or fourth glance her way i noticed when that she had clearly been crying earlier in the day, and seeing her alone like that just sucked. i thought that would have made me happy, you know? in some sort of pay-back type of way. seeing the person who hurt you get whats coming to them, and all that. but seeing her like that just tore me apart. so i went to the back of the class and asked a mutual friend of ours to move up front and sit by her. i didnt say why, not many people knew we had broken up at that point. i hated myself about 2 minutes later when i had to hear her laugh and joke with my friend the rest of class, but it was definitely better than seeing her suffer alone. tldr; got dumped by my high school gf, saw her upset and alone the next day in class together, asked a mutual friend to sit by her and cheer her up even after getting dumped.	14	20618	bls9ab	emrwbmp
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i grew up right at or below the poverty line and rarely got nice things. i never went hungry or anything but i definitely had to work to get things for myself. i got a pair of jordans because they were super popular and i thought they were cool. literally the next day a kid came up to me who lived in our local group home and said he loved my shoes and he wished he could afford a pair. next day, i wore my shitty old nikes and gave him my jordans. my mom said i would regret it but the pure gratitude from him was worth it.	13	20618	bls9ab	emry69z

what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	i was waiting for a cab to go home from work and that day was a pretty busy one. the cab rushed into the parking lot and picked me up. inside was an elderly lady waiting to go to the bank. by the time we pulled up to the bank, it was already closed (we were 3 minutes late) and the cab driver tried to tell her to call the dispatcher for another ride and she would have to wait a good 45 minutes. in the rain. i asked the cab driver to talk to the dispatcher about letting her just ride along until they have a chance to bring her home. they got all nasty and said she owed them $32 then for a round trip. she was worried because she didn't have the money since she didn't make it to the bank, so i paid for her ride. she was very kind and i felt that if i didn't get picked up, they could've made it. i know my little story isn't as heart warming as others. but i felt like this was just a nice story to share since a lot of people say my generation/age group are all shit heads.	13	20618	bls9ab	emrndlp
what's the nicest thing you've done for someone?	"this has actually happened twice in my life. the first time, i was on a flight around age 19, and the woman next to me started having a panic attack as we were taking off. i grabbed her hand and just started talking about cool things to do in florida (where the destination was) as she hyper-ventilated and started crying. i thought maybe i was making her uncomfortable or not helping, so i stopped talking and released my grip on her hand. she squeezed super hard and started tapping our hands on the armrest, so then i told some funny stories from high school. about twenty minutes later, she started to calm down. she told me she was so thankful for me being her 'flight buddy', and that she suffers from anxiety and it was the first time she had been in a plane, and that my rambling had distracted her enough to keep her focused on something because she usually ends up fainting multiple times during panic attacks. she had another one during descent but not nearly as bad. gave me a huge hug afterwards and called me an angel in disguise. second time happened earlier this year in february. similar story, woman sitting next to me got ultra scared but this time it was during some pretty intense turbulence. not a full-on panic attack, but she grabbed my hand and said ""i'm so sorry, i don't mean to be weird but i really don't like this (meaning the turbulence)."" i said no worries! gave her my earbud and we watched chopped together on my phone for the rest of the flight."	15	20618	bls9ab	emsckdq

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"a girl was leading me on, but also being obvious about it. i was stupidly believing i could change her ways and get her to actually date me. she had revealed she always wanted a giant teddy bear. so for her birthday/valentine's day i bought a giant bear costume from amazon and like 90 roses. the idea was one for every day i had know her. creepy and cringy af looking back. anyhow, she called me drunk the night before and screamed mean shit at me and i finally broke down and told myself she was a shitty person, because she always was terrible to me and i let myself think i could change that because i was desperate to not be alone. in the end i created a sign that said ""free bear hugs and roses for valentine's"" and wore the bear suit onto our college campus on valentine's day to give away all the roses. it made so many people happy that it was one of the best things i've ever done. so many hugs and girls were crying because they didn't have to feel so alone on a shitty commercialized holiday. it was cool. plus the football players all took a flower and hugged me, which was surprisingly wholesome."	10388	33418	bogywr	enh5w9o

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	when i was 16, i wanted to buy my girlfriend a ring for her birthday. i had been working and saved up. my plan was to get a silver ring with her birthstone. and pay around $600-700. i go to a jewelry store at the local mall and discover it is going out of business soon and had 70% off diamond rings! what an amazing deal, i thought. why not get a diamond for the same price. fast forward to her birthday party, and she's opening her gifts in front of her entire family and friends. she opens mine and immediately lights up and puts the diamond ring on her ring finger. the room gasped and i nearly passed out. i realized immediatly what i had done. i had bought an engagement ring. i thought her dad was gonna kill me right there. but after telling them what happened and alot of convincing, they finally realized how funny it was. i exchanged the ring the next day.	502	33418	bogywr	enh7cvq

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"do i have to pick just one thing? **high school:** i had a good job where i could work 40 hours a week and go to school, so i had a stupid amount of money and parents who for some reason didn't pay any attention to what i was doing with it. as a senior, i was dating a sophomore, and her mom told her ""it's not your prom, so i'm not paying for a dress and everything."" i ended up spending well over $1,500 on dress, and hair, and makeup, and shoes, and manicure, and a photoshoot, and a custom made blue topaz pendant with a massive stone i hand-picked to perfectly match the dress she would be wearing. last time i saw that stone it was on a chain around her best friend's neck after we broke up. **college:** girlfriend of several months called me up and was sobbing incoherently. all i could make out between the gulps of breath and wailing was ""died."" her grandmother was not well, and she and i would go visit her from time to time so i assumed it was her grandmother that died. i threw my xbox controller mid-game at my roommate, leapt to my feet and said ""hey man, i have to go!"" once i arrived at her apartment and calmed her down i managed to ascertain that it was not her grandmother who had died, but her goldfish. she said she wanted to have a funeral for her fish. i was.annoyed.but determined to compassionately help her cope because obviously that goldfish mattered to her. i recommended she go get cleaned up and take a hot shower to relax, and while she was in there i called up a couple of my friends, and some of her girlfriends. i had a buddy of mine go to the park at the small campus lake and dig a fish grave, i had her girlfriends take her out to lunch, then i got the floating carcass out of the bowl, wrapped it in toilet paper, and placed it in a jewelry box coffin. we went and had a full fish funeral with music and people speaking and psalm 23 by the lake. afterward, when we were back at her apartment, she said ""i don't know why you did that, we should've just flushed it."" we broke up a few weeks later. tl;dr: i was an idiot who made underappreciated grand gestures edit: my first silver! thanks kind stranger! i'll use it to buy a life insurance policy on my kid's first goldfish! edit 2: my wife is going to be thrilled that my first reddit gold was a story about ex girlfriends. now i have to go figure out how gold works, lol. edit 3: there's some vitriol in the comments toward the bereaved fish owner. this was 15 years ago, most of us are cringy and foolish at times when we're younger. she's a perfectly delightful person, just not the person for me. be kind.

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	in high school this girl who i was close friends with (but also had a not so secret crush on) told me once how she really loved those huge 7 foot tall teddy bears, so i told her one day i'd buy her one and she laughed, writing it off as a joke. fast forward like 3 years later when we're going to the same local college and reconnected after slowly drifting apart after high school. she tells me one day that she's sick so i do the only logical thing. drive to costco after class, drop 200 bucks on that huge teddy bear, stuff it into the backseat of my tiny honda civic, drive incredibly dangerously since the bear is taking up my entire rear window, then show up at her front door. she says it feels too weird and romantic given our past (me having that not so secret crush back in high school and her having to tell me multiple times that we're better off as friends) so i do the whole drive back and return the bear.	17673	33418	bogywr	engqxog
guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i met a girl and fell head-over-heels for her. she lived in another state, nevertheless, we started a long distance relationship. coincidentally, she had just lost her job, so i sent her money every week. (almost my entire check) and i drove out to see her every chance i got. that autumn i found out she had a boyfriend and was just using me to pay her rent. i was at work when i found out and just left. i had to confront her about deceiving me. i drove 3 hours to her house and by the time i got there, i knew it didnt matter. she wasnt the person i thought she was. i gave her everything i had for nothing in return. instead of being mad or saying something that would win her back i told her that she a horrible person for lying to me; that i hope someday someone hurts her as much as she did me. the next day i went back to my job to see if i could get my last paycheck. my boss took me into his office and laid into me about being irresponsible and failing the company while i was sitting there, i could barely hear him as all i could think about was how stupid i was and suddenly, i started crying. i mean torrents of tears, ugly cry. i must have bawled for a good ten minutes. my boss stopped berating me and silently waited for me to get control of myself. then, in a very sympathetic tone, he told me its ok. i was in love like that once. we all do stupid things in the name of love. try to learn from this. it may seem like the world is ending but its not. youll be ok. then he sent me back to work stating that we never have to talk about it again. (he was a good boss and a great guy.) edit: a word edit2: wow! my first gold! thank you kind strangers!!! im really surprised by the responses. thanks for the encouragement and kindness. and to those of you who share similar experiences - i hope you have learned, as i have, that you are not alone. if your heart was broken, it will heal. to quote a friend - youll be ok i will try to answer some questions here. * this happened almost 30 years ago. * i had just graduated from high school. * she was older than me by several years. * we met through a friend i worked with. he found out what she was doing and told me at work. (probably not good timing!) i freaked and just walked out. * when i went back to work the next day, i was just planning to ask if i could be paid for the hours that i had completed that week. * this was back before direct deposit was a thing. * i no longer work at the company (the boss eventually retired and sold it.) * i gave her money because i was young and stupid. * she weaved tales of woe and i was all too happy to be the hero and save her. * i sent the money via western union (fun fact: if you send a lot of money through wu they will automatically make you a gold member so i got that goin' for me, which is nice.) * there were a lot of red flags that i ignored. the most glaring was that she lied. she lied to everyone. and here was my dumb ass thinking she wouldnt lie to me * it was my first time being in love. i had girlfriends in high school, but i had never felt like i was in love with them. so i had no idea that someone could use that against me. * my boss ended up being like a father-figure to me. gave me a lot of advice and guidance. * i am now married to the love of my life. * i am now a manager and i try to emulate some of my former boss great qualities with the people who work for me.	16172	33418	bogywr	engvhj7

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"i was so completely obsessed with a girl that i disregarded my own well being and threw away any chance i had for success. we dated for 4 years while we were in school for architecture. towards the end of our degrees, she started having trouble with her thesis project and asked for help. in what can only be described as a lengthy period of insanity, i decided to stop working on my own projects and focus entirely on her thesis. i did everything for her - designs, drawings, models, and write-ups. her presentation went flawlessly and she had the top grades in her class. as a result of staying up all night for weeks at a time and repeatedly delaying my own work, i failed most of my classes and dropped out of school. she was grateful, and begged me to help her work on her masters degree as well. no problem! got her straight a's and a brand new diploma to add to her collection. she dumped me on graduation day and immediately began a relationship with someone who understood the importance of self-respect. i'm not even mad - it was entirely my own doing, and i learned some valuable lessons. really expensive fuck up though. cost me about 8 years of my life playing catch-up. &#x200b; never put a school relationship before your own success. &#x200b; **edit: for those of you interested in a followup, here is what happened right after that shit show.** &#x200b; after i failed out of school, i tried to re-apply to my architecture program the following year. i got a letter in the mail letting me know that my student loans were in default, and i was ineligible for any financial aid. the news was soul crushing, and i really expected that my life was over. that's when i seriously considered suicide as a way out. &#x200b; in the end, i spent about a year in a complete haze, unable to function properly, not eating and rarely leaving my bed. i ran out savings, lost my apartment and had to move back into my parents house. the turning point for me was when i started speaking openly and honestly with my friends about what i was going through, and i credit them with pushing me in the right direction. i started researching suicide and how to combat negative thoughts, and ultimately came to the conclusion that life is something i want to experience - something interesting might happen eventually, even if things suck right now. &#x200b; to move forward, i embraced the fact that i was at rock bottom and convinced myself that there was nothing more i could lose. while my past self was afraid of failure, the new me said ""fuck it, let's do this."" my mission in life became getting back into school, no matter the cost. so i applied to any job i could, and was fortunate to be accepted at a landscape design company that needed a draftsman. after four years, working 9 hours a day at $12-$16 an hour, i had managed to make enough consecutive payments on my old school loans that they were deemed ""rehabilitated."" please keep in mind that during this time, i was able to live rent free and had minimal payments to bear, so i was extremely fortunate during that time. &#x200b; the last step was signing up for classes at my old school and taking out new federal loans. going back to school as an adult while working full time is tough, but at the same time i feel there's no better way to do it. i had a new appreciation my education, crushed my classes and graduated within 2 years - i even managed to bring my grades up from a 2.7 to a 3.2 gpa. &#x200b; so, that's the basic version of what happened. there's a ton of details i'm leaving out, like but covers most of it. if anyone is going through something similar, just hang in there. there are ways to fix almost any issue if you make the difficult choice to work towards a solution. start small and don't get overwhelmed if you are years away from reaching your goals. time will help heal your pain and you will learn lessons along the way."	11506	33418	bogywr	engtbzd

"not me but a friend. when we were in elementary school my friend had a huge crush on this girl. so one day he decides to ask her to be his girlfriend so he brings flowers and a note saying ""i love you, meet me at the basketball hoops"" so he puts the flowers in her locker (we didn't have keys for our lockers) then he slips the letter to her and goes to the basketball hoops, she gets there too, then he asked her out she said no, so out of sadness my friend climbs on a tree and says ""if you aren't going to say yes im gonna jump"". yeah it was still a no and he jumps down on his feet and twists his ankle. she then moved to another city far away. this was in third grade."	889	33418	bogywr	engrcpg
guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	cool. one i can answer. &#x200b; i had a break up that really hurt me emotionally. another girl comes along to manipulate me. we were together for a while when i decided to enlist to the military. she was upset so she convinced me to get an apartment with her that she could live in while i'm gone. fast forward to 3 months after i left: i found out she opened a credit card in my name ($1000), repeatedly cheated on me and trashed the apartment. &#x200b; this was almost 3 years ago and i'm still dealing with the repercussions. &#x200b; edit: i would say the worse part of all this was the mental aspect of being manipulated. the financial part was bad only because i wasn't making a ton of money before enlistment and not so much after.	2326	33418	bogywr	engricc

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	when i was around 15 i got really frustrated that a girl that i had known for a while did not want to like me and get together. i was texting her in the middle of class and the teacher made a comment about it and she made me handover the phone and something snapped in me. i threw a chair across the room hit my desk which broke my hand and i broke down crying. i thought about it today and it still makes me cringe sometimes. and i apologized to my teacher and everyone included. the girl is now one of my closest friends! edit: i threw the chair and then slammed my hand into the desk for the people that are confused. sorry english is not my first language	3133	33418	bogywr	eng802n
guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	bought her everything and trusted her. i had an ex that constantly made me feel like her life was falling apart no matter how much she tried to get ahead. she would ask for things like cars usually cheap ones so i didn't mind. well 3 cars later the amount was piling up. after the cars i was helping her pay rent because she would tell me someone stole from her or something like that. she never could keep a job and i'd believe her when she would say all the bosses were jerks or sexually harassing her so she was quitting. after a point i was paying for her cable bill while working an average of 65 hours a week to cover everything. she drove a decent mitsubishi eclipse while i drove a run down neon. i trusted everything she said and while i was working every hour i wasn't sleeping she was having sex with every guy she could so they could provide for her as well. i never knew because i didn't listen to anyone who said anything. when she got with my one close friend behind my back i managed to see who she was and we went separate ways. edit: so this got a fair bit of attention. to answer some question i only bought her cheap cars like $500 or less projects or beaters but i got them all running for her. the nice eclipse she had she got using money from her mother and such. as well you all are right to say i was an idiot i was but things are getting better and i don't talk to her anymore. edit 2: silver thank you anonymous redditor finally got something decent from that relationship	904	33418	bogywr	enggyqy

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i saw cuts on the arms of a girl whom i was close to in high school. i tried speaking to her about it and she said i wouldn't understand. but i knew she had no one else to talk to, so what did i do? i tried telling her i would understand and she wouldn't believe me. so i pretended i was also sad and anxious and that. me 'opening up' made her comfortable enough to open up. she was right though, i didn't understand but atleast she had someone to talk to even if i couldn't offer much help. we ended up dating for 2 years after both getting even closer due to all that. anyway, she ended up turning against all her morals and everything she stood for. turned into the people that were making her depressed and cheated on me. anyway, i must have done some pavlov magic because now i actually am depressed. edit: last paragraph made no sense. chabged wording.	2157	33418	bogywr	engbqb8
guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	not me but a friend of mine travelled halfway across the country to hookup with a girl. transport and hotel ended up costing about 400-500 due to him booking everything last minute and not bother looking for cheaper options. at first i kinda shrugged it off thinking that was pretty stupid but oh well. &#x200b; later he confessed that in total he actually blew about 1500 which was most of his savings at the time. apparently he paid for everything during the few days they were together. &#x200b; i know that people do plently of stupid shit in their 20s but holy fuck	104	33418	bogywr	engxyx8

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"helped an old friend out financially. she was talking about killing herself on social media after a week of red-flag posts i had ignored up until the last one where she talked about taking pills and just dying in her sleep. so i decided to reach out. i ended up spending many hours a day trying to get her spirits up. she was in an abusive relationship where the guy would take her money, get drunk/high, beat her up, accuse her of stealing his money she had in her bank account. i ended up helping her pay off some immediate bills, land a job, r getting out of that abusive relationship, helping her turn her debt around. it felt good to try and do something genuine for someone without the undertone or context of needing any reciprocation in any way. i already had a girlfriend in a happy relationship (this was a few years ago). i would call her at night incase she needed to talk and find out what progress she had made. she was in better spirits, and that made me feel better about doing the right thing. and then one day she didn't answer her phone. i called again, and no answer so i left her a voice message. the next morning i shot a good morning text and it was never ""read."" i went about my day. later, i found out she had blocked me from social media, and her phone. she had gone back to the guy that was mooching all her money and beating her, and last i knew she moved back in with him in a ghetto apartment basement somewhere, quit her job and her car got repossessed. lesson learned."	73	33418	bogywr	enh8rky

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"the last couple of years in high school my classmate and i were always flirting and occasionally we kissed at parties. then the moment came where she left high school and i had to redo the last year due to an accident which severly hampered my study. she left for another city (couple of hours away) to attend university. we promised we would stay in contact. after i rehabilitated for about 80% within 6 months, we agreed upon seeing eacht other in ""her"" city on a saturday night, but she never turned up. i geniunely believed we both liked each other. normally i would immediately brake off contact, however this girl was different. once or twice per year we would stumble upon each other in our hometown (we both have moved away from our hometown) and we immediately hit off with this obvious flirtatious behaviour. this is continued by staying in contact by whatsapp (text). after many tries like mentioned above i made the decision to stop all contact with her because it hurt everytime. she didn't even react to it (by fb or text). it turned out she was very toxic and i'm glad i don't speak to her anymore."	345	33418	bogywr	engh2tp

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i've posted this before but still funny to me. dating a gymnast in high school. we go to a park and i see parallel bars that are designed for stretching but i'm convinced i can do a handstand on them because i'm awesome. she keeps insisting they are too far apart but i don't listen. attempt said handstand, they were indeed too far apart so i collapse down jamming my chest past my hands and strain/tear all the ligaments holding my chest muscles to my breastbone. good times were not had later or for a long while after.	269	33418	bogywr	engqwps

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i've told this story before, but when i was about 8 years old we took a field trip to the field museum here in chicago. during our lunch break i decided to wander off to the gift shop and see what they had. i had a huge crush on this girl named victoria in my class and i saw this lady bug ring for a couple of dollars. i knew she liked lady bugs and i had money my parents gave me to buy something at the shop, so i decided to buy the ring and give it to her. i was really nervous and kept waiting for the right time to do it. i eventually decided to just go for it and walked up to her near the end of the trip. she was with some of her friends which made me more nervous, but i found the courage to do it. she looked at the ring and laughed. her friends joined her and she then tossed the ring in the trash. i was completely devastated and tried hard to hold back my tears. even though i'm over it now, that completely fucked my confidence with girls for a long time. looking back, i may have embarassed her too giving it to her in front of her friends, which is why she reacted that way, but whatever the case, it's probably the most embarassed i have been in my life.	887	33418	bogywr	engm5aa

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	i'm female, hope this counts. first girlfriend, first serious relationship. she kept saying how much fun it would be to have a dog together and i'm a huge pushover so we did. we couldn't agree on dogs because she had bad taste and didn't trust my judgement. finally i gave in and accepted the next dog she brought up. 65 pound pitbull mix. insane! i wanted to get rid of him but knew no one else would adopt him. he had severe behavioral issues, crippling separation anxiety, and endless energy. my girlfriend walked him once for 10 minutes, then handed me the leash and never walked him again. aside from occasionally feeding and watering him i did all the work. i had emotional breakdowns due to the stress of loving this dog and feeling like nothing i did helped. 2 hours of a walks a day at least, training, grooming, vet appointments, nail trims, hikes, socializing with other dogs, going to pet friendly businesses. i was in college and working. i have no idea how i took care of him and rehabilitated that dog into the well-mannered friend he is today. she and i broke up. darwin (the dog) and i are still together living out our happily ever after. stupidest thing i did for a girl, best thing i did for me (and darwin).	48	33418	bogywr	enhj0ou

guys who did something stupid for a girl, what did you do?	"might not be something too insane or extreme,but: this happened in 2018's st. valentine: at my high school, between every hour, we get a 10 minutes pause and a 20 minutes one ( basically lunch break ). at the time it was really cold and snowy, with the snow being near 1 meter and a half high. through the class' windows you could see the ""violent"" snowstorm easily ( in my country the weather is pretty messed up ). i had a crush on a girl ( and i probably still do ) that's in my classroom, and since high school has started i've been planning to express my feelings about her, i just didn't know how. so, in that day, i decided to go through the snowstorm and buy one rose and wait for her in class as i knew that she wasn't there ( she usually goes out on every pause, especially on the 20 mins one ). those 15-20 minutes felt like more than 30; i had to find my way through the snow to the flower shop. i finally did it: i bought that rose, the biggest and the most beautiful one that was there. i got in class, waited for her with an insane anxiety ( as everyone, almost, in the class, after understanding to who the flower was ment to be given, was cheering on me). she comes, i start walking towards her, with the insane anxiety still hanging there, and i give her the rose, in a pretty ""common"" way, but still elegant. i ask her out to watch a movie together, she says that she will ""probably"" come, but i felt incredibly better and relieved. what happened? she kept postponing our date and we never ended up going out together. i literally prepared myself like 4 times ( 4 different fridays ) both physically ( clothing ) and mentally. she said to me, through someone i know, that she rejected me because of the bullies in my class, as half of the class started making fun of me bringing that flower to her, and that she ""would have liked"" to go out on a date with me. obviously, she didn't."	63	33418	bogywr	engs8oa

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"psychiatrist here. a 30 year old man with mild depressive symptoms was in-and-out of the hospital fairly quickly. he was under pressure from his home life, living with 4 roommates who were making life a bit difficult for him. no suicidal thoughts. he was cleared of all psychopathologies by me and two other doctors. a few months later he came back. same symptoms, however this time he talked about 5 roommates. it felt wrong, and i digged in his story. tried to contact his roommates. he lived alone and was severely psychotic. i have no idea to this day how he hid it so well from everyone. edit: a few more details: the patient talked, dressed and acted normally however after admitting him for a longer period we noticed he talked with his ""roommates"" often. he was single, no contact with his family and somehow working, however in a routine job with little to no personal contact. after a few talks he also claimed other peoples thoughts were sometimes ""thrown at him and sitting on his head"", and he could thus read people's minds against his will. the interesting thing about this patient was, that his internal world somehow fitted the external world when asked - his roommates sounded perfectly plausible (they were not e.g. shadow-people, vikings, 12 m tall) and they teased him by hiding his stuff. but he ate with them, watched tv with them, so on. normally a person with paranoid schizophrenia (paranoid meaning all types of delusions) will have multiple symptoms sometimes easy to see for the untrained eye. the patients can dress, talk and present themselves in odd ways, usually different from cultural norms. they can have incoherent speech, make up words and phrases or are clearly separated from reality (another patient of mine insisted that i was in jail for medicating him, even when we talked). when we quickly ""scan"" a patient for psychotic symptoms we basically look for inconsistencies in the patients experience of the world - the patients normally know ""something is wrong"" or ""weird"" or ""different"", but often belive it is the world around them, that have changed. this is due to discrepancy between what they experience (input), failed assessment of the inputs (due to the thinking disorder) and testing hypothesis based on failed assessments which collide with the real world. this will activate defense mechanisms fx denial, wild explanations, accepting both ""realities"" at the same time, and so on. (e.g ""i am not sick, my doctor must be a bad guy, bad guys are in jail, my doctor are in jail, but my doctor is sitting right in front of me at the same time, he must have an identical twin or this is an alternate reality). this is usually the way delusions are made. to summarize: when we scan for psychosis, we look for inconsistencies between the patients subjective experience of thinking, being and acting and the objective reality accepted by the generel cultural norm. this patient managed to live in a subjective psychotic world that just fitted so well with the objective reality that he tricked several psychiatrists including myself."	5348	55960	bquclv	eo8ormg
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"i have a story of a friend who was severely mismanaged. i've probably posted it before, but i'm to lazy to look. for 2 years, my friend had been going to her gp complaining about migraines, bouts of severe vomiting, and dizzy spells. every time, he would order bloodwork, then tell her she was fine. one morning, she woke up, and after a sexy morning with her husband, could barely stand. she was so dizzy and had such a bad migraine. she told her husband not to worry, sent him to work and had her neighbour driver her to the emergency room. she doesnt remember arriving. when she got there, she started acting erratic. they had to sedate her, and sent her for a ct scan of her head. there, they noticed a huge mass in her brain. the hospital wasnt equipped to deal with that, so they sent her by ambulance to the nearest hospital that could, a 4 hour drive away. this hospital immediately sent her for an mri. it wasnt a mass. they could actually see the ""mass"" growing as they did the mri. no, she was having a massive stroke. she was immediately taken in for surgery. they put in a stent, and had to remove most of the left side of her brain as it was all dead. afterwards, she was in a coma for nearly 72 hours. they were uncertain if she would wake up, and if she did, if she would ever recover. thankfully, she did. it took almost a year of physio, and speech therapy (among a few others), but she has made almost a complete recovery. they even had their first child 8 months ago. turns out, she had incredibly high cholesterol. with all the bloodwork that was done, her gp should have caught it. when she confronted him, he told her that her diagnosis was wrong. that she hadn't had a stroke and had made it up. she went after his license."	689	55960	bquclv	eo8dens

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i've had a couple of gems, but the one that really sticks out in my mind actually happened about a month or so ago. a young mother brought in a 6 year old to emerg, she was super nice, and apologetic because she thought that she was wasting my time, because she said that her son had started to develop different spots all over his body and she has no idea why. my initial first thought was chicken pox, so i had some swords and shields up ready to go for the anti-vax debate, but she claimed that she had her son vaccinated at all stages up to that point, and upon closer inspection they were mass of clusters of warts. not uncommon, but because of how rapidly that they were growing, i ordered some blood work to make sure there wasn't an underlying cause as kids immune systems are pretty well equipped to handle that sort of thing. and i'm really glad that she brought him in, because he had a severely low white blood cell count which revealed a primary immune deficiency disease.	555	55960	bquclv	eo8evsh

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	22 yo guy came in after seeing his primary at another hospital. his mom was my patient and asked if i would see him (i am an internal med doc). he had told his doctor he had a headache. i did a usual full review of symptoms since he was new and he also marked his left testicle had a lump. did exam and he had hard small lump on testicle. knew right away likely had metastatic testicular cancer. 1 stat brain scan and testicular ultrasound later confirmed it. asked him if told other doctor about the lump and he said yes but the other doctor told him it was normal. edit: he lived by the way but it was close a few times. so fellows if you note a lump on your testicle ask for an ultrasound and dont be embarrassed to bring it up. edit 2: for those of you who are concerned after examining yourself: there is a small soft area posteriorly that should be similar on both your testicles known as the epididymis. that is normal. a hard lump on only one side only is not. monthly self checks between ages 15-34 can be done but since rare (5/100,000) not a general recommendation.	10673	55960	bquclv	eo8813i

"eye doctor here. i had a patient i saw several months before they came in for their visit but well less than a year, which often means something could be wrong. in this case, as it turns out, nothing was wrong with her by way of complaints, she just wanted to get updated before getting some new glasses. we decided to just run the regular gamut of tests anyway just because we might as well while she was there. she was a 50yo woman, fairly normal exam, perfect vision, retinas showed healthy, but something about her pupils really bothered me before i dilated. we chatted about it and i asked her if she banged her head or anything weird and she said no, but suddenly reveals this crazy history of an old meningioma (a type of tumorous brain growth) she had removed a few years ago. she had decided to omit this from her history with us as she didn't feel it was important, but we went and put it into the charts anyway. turns out she got a ct done two weeks prior to her exam with me which she says turns up completely normal. i tell her she should tell her doctor about this anyway just to cover our bases. fast forward: patient shows up in my office ecstatic to tell me that my examination revealed that her tumor had returned with an incredible vengeance. she had no idea, was totally asymptomatic and the ct she had prior to me showed what was very literally the size of a spec of dust which the radiologist dismissed as ""artifact"". on her return to her doctor, they decided to re-run the ct to cover their bases, and they found a quarter sized tumor. within two weeks the tumor went from the size of a dust particle to a quarter. she was rushed into emergency surgery as the tumor was growing super fast and was close to a blood vessel which could cause a massive stroke. she had it removed that day and returned to me after recovery to tell me of what got discovered as a result of my testing. she is now a long time regular patient i have been seeing for about 10 years. edit: thank you kind giver of gold and silver! its good to be gilded! edit: for those asking about the pupils, they were asymmetric, and the larger one reacted less robustly compared to the fellow eye. this was a marked change from her previous examinations where no pupillary defects were noted."	13932	55960	bquclv	eo8bnkk
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i had a guy come in for a second opinion after the first place didnt bother asking any medical history. of course i took his history and asked more questions as we went. i remember telling him something felt off and we needed to run a test. so i ordered a peripheral vision test. when i got the test back i was shocked by the most classic tumor pattern id ever seen. two weeks later he was in surgery to get it removed. a month after this guy was back in my clinic thanking me. totally different guy. personality was a complete 180, energetic and happy. edit: heres another one i thought of though a bit more sad. but also good at the same time. heres a cautionary tale why urgent cares should never treat eye issues. lady was referred to me after 2 weeks of treated for a red painful eye. the pa and mds that saw her tried allergy meds and anti biotic is thinking it was allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis, or hoping it was mild viral that would resolve on its own. so i took one look at her and knew it was a herpes simplex infection in her cornea. she was in pain and had been mistreated for 2 weeks. got her on anti virals, but after discussing how it was odd she didnt have any active herpetic sores, but had a really bad cough that the er said was just pneumonia and would go away with antibiotics. i told her to get it checked with a pulmonologist because it didnt sound like pneumonia and it wasnt getting better. i saw her 3 months later to monitor her corneal appearance and she came in using a wheelchair. turns out the pulmonologist was blown away that the er had dismissed her. she had a really rare small cell lung cancer. the reason the herpes infection manifested in the first place was her immune system was compromised. she told me the pulmonologist said id saved her life because they caught it early. its been a bit over a year. shes still undergoing treatment but her spirits are strong and shes optimistic as is the pulmonologist.	10562	55960	bquclv	eo8862u
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	my dad ( a pediatrician specializing in neuro issues) was seeing one if his patients at the hospital got dragged into the nicu unexpectedly by a nurse who insisted a baby wasn't well. the attending doc insisted the kid was fine and just tired from a difficult vacuum assist delivery. my dad could tell the baby wasn't okay and managed to talk the parents into a brain scan. the nicu doc insisted my dad was nuts to the parents. dad was right and the kid had a brain bleed and was rushed to surgery. the baby would have died without the nurse bringing my dad in and the parents listening to him. as is, that extra time almost certainly cost brain function.	669	55960	bquclv	eo8aw9j

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"bit of a weird one, because the request for a second opinion came from an intensivist and i was a contributor to their treatment plan. i work in poisons control. had a call from a green, but very astute young doctor with a middle-aged female patient presenting with a vague 36-48hr history of malaise, confusion, hypoxia from hyperventilation, and hallucinations. on workup was noted to have pulmonary edema (lung fluid buildup), metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, sinus tachy and raised crp & wcc, suggestive of infection but no temperature. the initial diagnosis was sepsis. this keen-eyed doctor, pretty fresh out of med school, decided to do a salicylate level on this lady because the hyperventilation paired with metabolic acidosis and aki was enough to prompt her suspicions of aspirin poisoning, even though they could just as easily be explained by sepsis as well. the level came back high. not huge, but high, which prompted her to phone me for a second opinion on how relevant the finding was in terms of the patient's clinical picture. simultaneously, the patient's family investigated the property and located numerous aspirin blister packs suggesting she had been dosing herself for chronic pain, which was present in the medical history. chronic salicylate poisoning is insidious and has been referred to as a ""pseudosepsis"" in the medical literature as it often causes similar features. comparing a high level in chronic poisoning to the same level in acute poisoning, features are much more severe in chronic poisoning (i.e. pulmonary edema, hypoxia, aki etc) - there is a disparity. we recommended certain treatments (all hail sodium bicarbonate) and the patient made a full recovery after a 2 week hospital stay. whilst there was no question an infective cause was present and contributory, i was impressed with the green doctor's intuition and willingness to consider other causes - i feel like it greatly improved the patient's treatment. edit: some words."	8604	55960	bquclv	eo873oz

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor, but the patient. went to my family doctor with the worst headache of my entire life. she dismissed it, telling me it was a tension headache and that i should take a tylenol and lay down in a dark room. over the course of the next month, i saw her a total of 13 times, each time with worsening symptoms. first it was dizziness, then vomiting, then eventually i could no longer see out of my right eye. every time she told me it was just a tension headache or a weird migraine, gave me a prescription for pain killers and sent me on my way. the final straw was when i was no longer able to walk properly. i would try to take a step, but all i could manage was this weird shuffle. she reluctantly agreed to send me to a neurologist. the next day i showed up at his office and was in there for less than a minute. he took one look in my eyes and immediately called an ambulance. turns out i had hydrocephalus. my ventricles were 5x the size they were supposed to be, and my brain was literally being squeezed out of my head. go figure!	2978	55960	bquclv	eo86gqj

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i'm an emergency medicine doc in the midwest usa the patient was transferred from rural nowhere to our tertiary care facility (big hospital with every specialist). call was of really bad quality, but the transferring physician described a 21 year old male that had rapid heart rate and breathing rate, low blood pressure, low oxygen, confusion, and a severe opacification on his chest x-ray on the right side. diagnosed pneumonia. he gave him a ton of fluids, started antibiotics, put him on a ventilator, but he wasn't getting better, and wanted to send him to us. sure, send away. an hour later the gentleman arrives, and looks young, fit, and not the type to just drop dead from pneumonia. we roll him onto our stretcher and find. a huge stab wound in his back. the x-ray finding was his entire right chest full of blood. we put a tube in it, gave him back some blood, and he had to go for surgery to fix the bleeding. lesson: look at your patient.	28560	55960	bquclv	eo87wak
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	a bit of background: in my field of audiology we have people licensed to diagnose not only hearing issues but balance disorders and other factors impacting listening and understanding. we also have another field who popped up when it was not considered as ethical for us to *treat* those more serious hearing issues (i.e. with hearing aids) but they dont need the same doctorate level training, just barely high school or some college depending on jurisdiction. so i had a patient come in with a serious difference between left and right hearing and this in itself is considered a red flag because both ears are exposed to the same things over time. and there are very few explanations as to why one would get so bad. the patient could hardly understand words on that bad side and the better ear was pretty good overall, just minor hearing loss perhaps age-related. immediately upon seeing these test results, the ent and i agreed to send this patient for an mri of the head because something was off. the patient confirmed no mri or medical treatment had been recommended in the past and only hearing aids by this lesser-trained hearing aid dealer (working for a popular u.s. chain). the patient had been wearing these hearing aids already for a few years. the mri results came back. massive tumor on the hearing nerve. the hearing aid dealer is being investigated currently for malpractice (or more specifically a violation of state laws regarding red flags). edit: since a few of you are asking what happened with the patient, ill paste what got buried below. i dont usually get to see these cases if they get sent for surgery. im not in a big metro area so the very specialized ents (neurotologists) have their own audiologists to handle post-op testing. anticlimactic, i agree	6215	55960	bquclv	eo85spv

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	from the time i was 13,i had a growth on my thumb. it became so big that it affected my piano playing. i went to the doctor about it, and he diagnosed it as a wart. that had been there for nearly a decade. he used acid on it. that hurt, and did nothing. he used an electrical instrument to burn it. that really fucking hurt, and again did nothing. i moved to the uk, and was at a dinner party a friend was hosting. she was a nurse, and many of her friends were nurses and doctors. one of the doctors, a surgeon, saw the 'wart' on my thumb and became very excited. he called to his wife, a nurse, to come see. he told me that he couldn't diagnose me because i wasn't in clinic, but to make an appointment with my gp. i did, and was diagnosed with a neurofibroma, a type of tumour that developes around a nerve. i had surgery to remove it. it was the size of a lima bean. thankfully, it was benign, but no wonder the wart treatments hurt like a sonovabitch.	900	55960	bquclv	eo89vdl

"can i go ahead and speak on behalf of my doctor? 19m at the time (33 now), i felt sick for about a week, flu-like symptoms, didn't want to eat, just felt bad all over. one day at work i feel a very uncomfortable cramp/tear in my abdomen, so i go to one of those 24 hour clinics. at this point i'm slumped over, can't stand up straight without insane amount of pain, just generally uncomfortable and hating life. after a few hours at this clinic, they say ""you probably have kidney stones, go home, drink fluids, sleep it off"". this seemed fine to me, i was ready to go home and listen to the doc, all was good. but my girlfriend at the time (didn't last much longer than that) wasn't a fan of this diagnosis and drove me to the e.r., against my wishes of course. after a few minutes at the e.r., they determine my appendix has ruptured and i'm going septic. apparently i was pretty lucky to not have died, though i did pick up bacterial pneumonia while in the hospital, so the recovery kinda sucked. now i just have a crazy 6-7 inch scar on my belly to remind me to not avoid hospitals when i'm sick. edits, more info, medical terms, etc etc."	10235	55960	bquclv	eo86ftv

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	at one of my practica placements, i conduct psychological evaluations for children and adults referred by the court system, typically following court-mandated removal. the referrals almost always ask for differential diagnoses and treatment recommendations. many of the children have previous psychiatric diagnoses and are prescribed a slew of medications. in this sense, the psychological evaluation is a comprehensive second opinion that requires me to sort through previous diagnoses, background information, and data from the assessments i administer. i would say that the most common misdiagnoses that i see among children are bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). often times when a child has a traumatic history (as many of my clients do), they exhibit signs of hypervigilance, avoidance, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral issues. the hypervigilence looks like the hyperactivity found in adhd and the hypomania/mania in bipolar disorder. emotional dysregulation and avoidance (e.g., social withdrawal) is easily mistaken for the depressive side of bipolar disorder and can also result in disruptive behaviors characteristic of adhd. there are also some serious repercussions of prescribing children psychotropic medications to treat psychiatric disorders they do not have. to answer the question directly, its rewarding when you have the opportunity to help clarify a childs psychiatric diagnosis and ideally write treatment recommendations that improve their prognosis. im a fan of comprehensive second opinions, especially in the arena of mental health.	424	55960	bquclv	eo8ayb6

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	it's not exactly what you're asking, but i'm a primary care doctor who had a 2 year old refugee girl in who had a sore throat, and something just didn't sit right with me - it could have been easy to just say she was under the weather but she sort of was holding herself too stiffly and breathing too consciously. anyway, particularly with the language barrier i sent them to the emergency room because i was concerned there might be a foreign body in her throat and i didn't have the proper tools to look, and it turns out there was - she had swallowed a button battery and it was eating through her esophagus. one more day and she very well may have died. as it turns out, she had some scarring and slight narrowing but i'm hopeful that it won't really affect her significantly moving forward. for any parents out there, be exceedingly careful about button batteries in the house for young children. young kids like to put things in their mouths and swallow them, and button batteries are basically the perfect size and shape for that. the morbidity and mortality rate is quite high and it's bad news bears.	174	55960	bquclv	eo8fj25

"oh god where to start. i literally just admitted this lady to icu.had been coughing for ages, 60 lb weight loss, smoker for 50 yrs. now she can't breathe and i got a ct 6cm mass looks very suspicious for lung cancer. and the doctors for 4 yrs throughout this just gave her vitamin d/e even though she was losing massive weight and coughing up blood. another guy who came in looked pale as a ghost. chief complaint was fatigue. one lab test later found out his hemoglobin was 4 (barely on the cusp of survival). seems like he had iron deficiency anemia for yrs, doctor gave him some iron, he got better but no one looked into why he got it (#1,2,3 reason in an older guy is colon cancer). he died 4 months later from metastatic colon cancer. another story- last month was about to take a long trip across the pacific. 1 hr in on the flight they ask for a doctor.i volunteer myself. i see this lady literally gasping for air.like waving her hands in the air cuz she can't breathe. look through the meds.she's obviously an asthmatic. listen to her lungs and faint wheezing no air movement at all. i later grounded that plane because there was another sixteen hrs to go and she was on verge of being intubated. later i get more story from family member. apparently she wasn't been able to sleep well for past two weeks. doctor just gave her sleeping meds.more and more of it. told her flying no problem.i ask the family why can't she sleep? is it because she wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for air (classic sign of uncontrolled asthma). they're like yes, how did you know?. sleeping meds prob among worst things she could have gotten and almost killed the patient by saying she could fly. people who get diagnosed with ""bronchitis"" when they have heart failure and literally drowning in fluid. there are doctors who give antibiotics and steroids for everything esp when they have no idea what's going on. maybe i'm biased because i work at an academic center so i see all the cases who get referred in because they're too sick or no one can figure out but at least a few times a week i'm like wow this person could have been saved or not end up this way if someone cared enough earlier on. i'm going to say this as a doctor. it's honestly scary every day how many patients i see are completely mismanaged. some doctors in urgent care see like 45 patients in a day. how is that possible to be thorough??? like if only patients knew what the doctors missed or what not.half the time i really think it's like going to an bad auto shop and not realizing they're just making half the shit up. same thing happens in medicine and except people's lives suffer because of it. edit-added a story. thank you to whoever gave me silver/gold. let me say something.people are saying i'm gregory house or something. i'm not. i purposely didn't choose stories that were some esoteric diagnoses. everything i picked is like bread and butter medical student level. half of being a good doctor is knowing what questions to ask. sometimes you don't even know what's important or not. the other half is caring. too many just put a band-aid on the problem and punt the patient to someone else. is it the doctors fault? i don't know but i do know the medical system in the us provides no incentives for doctors to actually practice good medicine. in fact, i bring in less money if i'm thorough versus i do the same thing every patient and see 100 patients a day (which is what some do unfortunately). i have tons more stories, hopefully i'll get to share some more but for now have to sleep (was on call overnight). &#x200b; edit x2: thank you again for all the gilds! i don't even know what they all do or mean but i'm very grateful nonetheless. few more things i wanted to say - there are plenty of amazing doctors out there, not all are bad. we all put our lives on hold for ten years for altruistic purposes. not everyone just wants to make a quick buck so i hope i didn't characterize it as such. i tried to respond to some comments but i don't have time to respond to all. a lot asked - ""so how do i find a good doctor?"" the answer is.i don't know. i've tried looking for good ones myself and it's hard. i joke you should find the doctors all the other doctors go to because i have a higher ""bs"" meter when i meet a bad one. doctor rating websites are garbage. i've seen doctors get great ""ratings"" because they just hand out opioids/benzodiazepines to everyone even if all his or her patients become addicted later. a lot of it is really your gut feeling. a good one should listen to you and most importantly, sometimes be confident enough to say ""i don't know but i'll look it up or send you to someone who does know."" the scariest ones are those who don't even realize what they don't know. and the most perplexing thing to me.if you don't like an auto mechanic or realtor, you would find another right? do the same for doctors! it's your life.can be a difference between living or dying one day. go find someone who will advocate for you, it's the least you can do for yourself."	20191	55960	bquclv	eo85oi0

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"as an ophthalmologist, i've seen quite a few misses unfortunately. the eye is just not very well studied outside of this field so many doctors do not feel comfortable with the eye which is understandable. there was one case of a small child who had a minor trauma to the eye. the er called and stated that everything looked fine and she was most likely ready to go home but would prefer if we came down to take a look. got down there, examined her and she had an open globe (eyeball was ruptured meaning there is actually a hole in the eye that needs to be closed surgically). was very glad we got that call. another time a patient came in to the er complaining of complete loss of vision. upon exam his vision was light perception only in both eyes. this means that the patient cannot even see a hand waving 2 inches from their face but they can still make out light vs dark. he stated he had went to the er 2 months ago when his vision first started deteriorating but was told he had ""conjunctivitis"" and given antibiotics ointment. he did not return to the er for 2 months because he did not have insurance and was homeless at the time. my alarm bells were already ringing at this point. i did an exam to look at the retina and saw numerous white plaques which is a sign of inflammation with infection being the most concerning. the patient ended up having syphilis that had gone into his eye and made him blind. unfortunately, at this point his prognosis for recovering vision was poor even with treatment. this next one was not really a miss but more of a delayed diagnosis. a patient came to the er 1 month after a gunshot wound to the head. did surprisingly well since the bullet missed most of the important structures in the brain. he was back in the er as the swelling on his eye had not gotten better. it's common after a big trauma like that for the eye to be swollen for 1 to 2 weeks before getting better. he also was complaining of double vision. on exam his eye was swollen and being pushed forward out of orbit and he could not move his eye to the left. given his history i was worried he developed something called an artery venous fistula which is where an artery and a vein combine causing the high pressure in the artery to enter the vein and build up a back pressure causing the vein to engorge because it can no longer drain blood. got a ct scan to confirm. patient went to surgery the next day. i do caution the general public to be weary of this thread though. it is unfair to doctors look at this thread and claim incompetence. diseases usually develop on a continuum age and one doctor might catch it at a later date because it has had more time to present itself. there is also a stepwise approach to medicine. if you gave everyone with a headache a ct scan there would be more harm then good. it's possible that when a person gets a second opinion they see the first doctor already ruled a lot of things out so they are in a better position to diagnose, whereas if you had stayed with the original doctor and continued to work with him he may have gotten to the diagnosis as well. as a patient it can be frustrating but be mindful that most doctors do want what's best for you and there may be a lot of things going on in the background you are unaware of. for example when patients come in for cold symptoms, they assess usually frustrated when they are told there is no treatment needed. they feel like it is a waste of a trip. but that doctor used his medical knowledge to 1. reassure you 2. avoid harmful if unneeded antibiotics 3. made sure you didn't actually have a diagnosis that requires emergent treatment"	746	55960	bquclv	eo89i06
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor but my doctor said this to me. i had a picc line (like a long iv that stays in your arm for a while) for infusions. i had a complication that resulted in a type of allergic reaction, which caused an ulcer that got infected. an infection can spread through a line very quickly and turn into sepsis because the line goes right into your heart. i was sent to the hospital by my infusion nurse and the doctor at the hospital told me he didnt have any knowledge about central lines, and sent me home without doing bloodwork or looking at the site. i went to a better hospital in a nearby city the next day and the whole line had to be taken out, plus a course of two antibiotics. doctor there called the other one an idiot.	717	55960	bquclv	eo867ai

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	10 days ago i saw a 22 year old patient, a pakistani foreign student. he had gone to another hospital some days before for aspecific neck pain, they gave him ibuprophen and sent him home. nothing had changed so he came to the hospital where i work. he had low and persistent fever (refused paracetamol because of ramadan) and swollen lymph nodes in his neck and clavicle. sent him for a chest x-ray which showed a very suspicious mediastinic mass. he then had a cat scan with contrast, that mass was enlarged lymph nodes as well. we contacted the hematology specialist and booked an appointment for the next day, it all suggests a lymphoma. now, to be honest, i m not even sure i made a difference in this guy's life because it seemed advanced but at least i pointed him to the right direction.	151	55960	bquclv	eo88rii

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	er scribe here. had a girl come in who was about 22, tattoos, weird piercings, the whole lot. we work in an ed on the edge of a rural part of the state so we get all kinds of weird people with weird, frequent complaints that you work up and almost always end up having nothing. at the same time, you get the people who have avoided doctors their whole life and have the worst of the worst diagnoses. she said her right leg felt funny while she was driving and then complained of other weird, brief tingling sensations in her arms. further she said she had a migraine this morning before work. she has a long history of migraines, etc. essentially in the er it would have been easy to just treat her for a complex migraine and have her on her way, especially since she was asymptomatic at presentation. for whatever reason, doc i worked for leaned in to the weird, disconnected paresthesias and mri-d her. probable signs of multiple sclerosis and she ended up admitted for neuro workup. so she had been told her whole life she had migraines when in fact if was probably ms. sure, she never made the effort to follow up with a neurologist who wouldve definitely stuck her in the mri scanner, but we also couldve just as easily written her off as crazy and sent her home. as a scribe ive really learned the value of the statement i have a mri/ct scanner and im not afraid to use it. also, ive become a big proponent of taking an extra step to prove people that theres nothing emergently wrong with them.	263	55960	bquclv	eo8a1et

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	this actually happened a few weeks ago. my sister went to urgent care because she had a bad cough and was having trouble breathing - they said it was a virus and gave her antibiotics my mom took her to her primary dr who confirmed it. 10 days later she wasnt better so my mom took her back and insisted she get an x ray. the doctor said, i dont know why you brought her back in - its just a cough. turns out entire right lung was collapsed, which showed on the x ray. it had been for almost two weeks. the doctor called us and said you need to go to the er right now. and then began an emergency surgery in the er, admittance to the hospital for a week, and another surgery two days later edit to add: checked with my mom, sister was prescribed the antibiotic clarithromycin. and confirmed that they did say virus originally it was a really horrible experience overall - from the urgent care to the primary doctor. at the er (and then the hospital when she was admitted) it was a bit better. she had an emergency surgery in the er where the doctor put a tube in her through her back to inflate the lung and another to remove excess liquid from her lung. so for the rest of her time there she had the tube connected from her back to a big plastic clear briefcase looking thing that filtered blood and liquid out of her lung. her second surgery was bc her lung wouldnt inflate back up bc - surprise! - she had a big leak in her lung they needed to repair she was kind of hilarious bc while on morphine she kept dropping f bombs (where is the fucking nurse with my food) but she doesnt remember anything from the hospital anymore she has down syndrome and the cause of the collapsed lung was actually because at the special olympics her team of petite women played against 60+ tall men w tattoos. (dont even get me started on how stupid the special olympics can be, with literal ringers used to win gold in the lowest division.) a man chest bumped her and fell on top of her and we think thats what caused it. shes predisposed to these kinds of things bc of her down syndrome - and had open heart surgery at 2 for a hole in her heart anyway, shes a champ. heading back to work today unhappily, but excited because shes been cleared to go to a special needs prom next friday 	1511	55960	bquclv	eo84s3z

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"i am a doctor (primary care with some emergency), and can't really think of any good examples of this right now. it's definitely happened, but never in a way that i end up holding it against the other doctor involved. you kind of end up too busy doing your job. one phrase that i find myself repeating to patients is ""i don't really understand what \[previous doctor\] was thinking here, but the way that the guidelines/my experience has taught me to approach this problem is \[hopefully correct solution\]"" most of the time, the fact that the patient has gone looking for a second opinion or another consult tells you about their level of concern and changes your management. doctor #1 might see a patient with 2 days of low abdo pain and (correctly) reassure the patient that it's probably nothing and come back in a week if symptoms continue. patient then goes to doctor #2 a couple of days later, more worried and cheesed off at #1. with the increased level of concern, #2 then orders an ultrasound that reveals ovarian cancer. the issue here is that both doctors are correct. the next abdominal pain that comes in to see either doctor at 2 days of symptoms will still receive reassurance as their primary treatment, because it will most likely be something simple like constipation or cramping. giving every patient with simple symptoms an ultrasound is not economically feasible. i would hope that any diagnoses i've missed or mismanaged (and i assume there's been a few) were picked up by another doctor and that they also gave me the benefit of the doubt.

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doc, but happened to my wife and i. she was 3 months pregnant and did ultrasound. all normal. baby heart rate was 99, and healthy. however for some reason, the ultrasound tech forgot to measure something and doc ordered a second ultrasound. second appt in about a month, as my wife wanted to delay as she hated having to drink so much and not pee so the ultrasound comes out clearer. i couldn't be with her for second ultrasound as work got in the way. however she calls me tearfully saying that the doctor ordered she abort the fetus for her safety and her health and she insisted on calling me to let me know before she did the procedure. apparently the baby heart rate hadn't changed since first ultrasound a month ago, and this was bad enough to put mom at risk in pregnancy. i fucking flew to the hospital. i can't remember how i got there but i crossed heavy traffic to the hospital in about 10 min of what is normally a 20min trip. parked on curb, jumped out and rushed to her room. thankfully nothing happened to her yet. and i just camped there insisting on another ultrasound. i kept telling the doctor it was a copy paste error. you see, the heart rate from first ultrasound to second was exactly the same. i knew - just knew, that the tech copy pasted the first report and forgot to update that rate. i screamed bloody murder if anyone would touch my wife. security was almost called until another doc came in and said just do another ultrasound to decide the issue. the ordered a second ultrasound and heartrate was normal. my son is now 10 and i remember that fear and rage everyday i look at him.	5299	55960	bquclv	eo85k4m

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor, but i heard my son's doctor say this. i took him to the er late one night because of coughing and a high fever. they took an x ray, gave him ibuprofen, and told us he was fine. doctor showed me the x rays to prove it and gave me a dirty look when i asked what the dark spots were. i told her she was and idiot and took him to urgent care 4 hours later. the doctor that saw him immediately diagnosed him with pneumonia and confirmed with xrays. i flat out refused to pay for the er visit and told them that if the persisted with collections i would push their incompetence. they never called me again. edit: this really blew up! i would like to thank all the fine medical professionals out there for explaining dark spots on x rays. these are the exact answers that i was expecting for my question to that doctor. the fact that i did not receive any explanation of any type and received backlash at the mere questioning of a diagnosis would indicate some type of insecurity or complex that makes that doctor put their time and feelings ahead of my child's health. the fact that all of you spent a few minutes explaining and typing this on reddit really makes that doctor look really bad considering she couldn't spend 30 seconds giving an explanation.	10789	55960	bquclv	eo80ugs

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"not a doctor, but this happened to me when i was 2, my parents have told me the tale multiple times. i started being a less and less cheery 2 year old. i wasn't very communicative so my parents inferred that i was sick. i would grab my stomach and bend over. it got worse when i ate or drank things. obviously looked like i had some kind of stomach/abdominal pain. my parents weren't sure what to do, we were very poor at the time, i didn't even have a pediatrician yet, they just took me in to the er worried it was something life threatening. the er doctors looked at me and told my parents one of my intestines was twisted on itself and i needed surgery within 24 hours. my parents were freaking out, my dad called old friend of his whose opinion he greatly valued/trusted. his friend was like ""have they cut into him yet! stop! take him to this pediatrician, my granddaughters all go there and he's amazing."" they took me in for a second opinion, but didn't tell the pediatrician about the first opinion, just said ""hey look he's in pain, what's wrong?"". pediatrician took a look at me, looked in my throat and visibly winced. he wrote a prescription for amoxicillin and gave me an injection on the spot for some antibiotics. he said to make sure i take it twice a day for the next few days and i'd be fine in a few days. at that point my dad revealed the first opinion. he told the pediatrician that he had been told i needed emergency surgery. the pediatrician's response was ""whoever said that was mistaken, he has a severe strep throat infection, the antibiotics will clear it right up."" my parents asked about me holding my stomach. my pediatrician said that's a normal response in small children who feel the sore throat pain when swallowing. sure enough, within a few days i was back to my cheery self. if my dad hadn't seeked out a second opinion, they probably would have gone through with the surgery, opened me up, found nothing wrong, closed me back up, given me antibiotics as a routine post-surgery thing, and those antibiotics would have fixed me up. who knows if they would have fessed up to their mistake or my parents would just be stuck with a huge bill for a misdiagnosed problem. that pediatrician was an amazing man, he was my doctor until i turned 18 and my family recommended him to everyone and anyone that needed recommendations. he's long since retired, but i do think of him every once in a while. you da man, dr. m!"	60	55960	bquclv	eo8dkqs

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor, but a paramedic, so hopefully i wont be laughed out of the comments section for this. about a year ago, i got called to a 15 y/o male whod collapsed in the parking lot of his residential apartment complex. as a 911 service, we get called to a lot of situations that might seem emergent to people going about their daily business, but appear relatively routine or mundane to us in terms of acuity; additionally, because it was 15 min before shift change, and 15 year olds rarely collapse from spontaneous cardiac arrest, i was fully prepared to call bs on this before we arrived on scene. turns out the kid was, indeed, in total arrest, and we took over from the bystanders who initiated compressions and went into full code mode. our standards of care mandate that we work a code for up to 40 minutes, depending on patient presentation, before we call a doc for termination of resuscitative efforts, and so we worked this kid for 40 minutes in the parking lot and still had no return of pulses. at this point, and i still have no idea whether my decision was based in emotion, clinical observation, or just a gut feeling, i elected to transport a working cardiac arrest (something we rarely do) rather than call for tor. got to the ed (level 2 trauma, cath lab, primary stroke, great facility), wheel the kid with ongoing compressions and interventions into the room, and the ed doc (in my experience, a fantastic doctor) takes a look at the patient, feels for a pulse, and says [this patient] is gone and gets ready to call it. then he looks at me, and im pretty shattered at this point, and says hell do an ultrasound to demonstrate. conducts the ultrasound, and lo and behold, the kids heart is beating: weakly, but beating. kid gets transferred to pedi icu, wakes up within the week, and attended a survivors dinner 2 months ago where i tried not to cry excessively in front of him. overconfidence and an inability to share perspective/clinical opinions are a dangerous path to navigate in the medical profession. i was enormously lucky, as was this patient, to have multiple trained providers in this case, and if the doc hadnt performed the ultra. well, this story would be a much sadder one.	47	55960	bquclv	eo9hzqy
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	heard this from an ultrasound tech, a man came in severely injured after a car accident. the man had a laceration above his right thigh along with a puncture wound from his door or something from the car, can't remember. the doctor ordered an ultrasound of this mans leg in order to make sure the vein had not been punctured. the guy was doped up on painkillers by the time he had gotten to the tech, so he was loopey as hell while she was performing the scan. she felt something metallic against his arm when she was positioning his thigh to get a full scan. she asked him if his leg had another puncture wound on the inside of his thigh. he told her no, he just has a massive piercing on his penis, like a fucking bull horn or some shit. she asked him to position his privates away from her while she performed the rest of the scan. breaking hipaa laws, this tech told her husband (at home not at work) about this mans piercing, her husband was a mri tech at the same hospital. the next day, the same man was scheduled for an mri on his thigh. now mri's are magnetic resonance imaging, so its literally a fucking magnet that will fuck up piercings. because that ultra sound tech had broken hipaa laws, she actually had saved this mans dick. her husband warned him to remove all piercings from his body and made sure this man knew that he meant all piercings. not exactly a second opinion story but whatever.	1510	55960	bquclv	eo838l9
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor but a lucky patient, during my last 4 days of boot camp, i woke up 2 hours before we were supposed to and i couldn't breathe, i was gagging and choking and it took about 2 minutes before i could again. everyone thought i was just malingering so that i'd get out of the last 4 days and relax until i went home. went to a doctor and they did basic tests, said it could be my allergies or something (suuuper allergic to pollen but not this bad) and i was sent back to the barracks. my trouble with breathing continues and i'm more sore than i have been since the first week or so. anyways, i go home (still live with my family) and and i was obviously tired and sore and wanted to be lazy for a bit, so when the first couple days i was sleeping for 16 hours a day my family just thought i was exhausted and needed rest. after 7 or so days of this they got tired of me being lazy and decided make me get up outa bed and do a bunch of house work, wash their cars just anything to keep me outa bed. i tell them i don't feel good and everything still hurts, my chest feels heavy and i need to get back in bed but they aren't having it. finally i convince them to let me see the doctor, but they just agree its muscle pains primarily, and that i need to keep using them to eventually make the soreness go away. eventually, going back to university, one of my professors notices i don't look to well, i explain my symptoms and tell him what's going on, (this was a math prof. not even medically trained just common sense) he suggests i get tested for mono, and lo and behold guess what i got? turns out, the people doing the health screening neglected several people, and the officers in charge of us said if ever out of water share canteens with the closest person to you. so no running to refill it or anything, this apparently spread mono throughout my battalion. when i got a doctor who confirmed this, they later find out my spleen was on the verge of rupturing, and if i had gone another few days or a week more, ~~it would have and i would have drowned internally~~ could have caused a life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. &#x200b; edit: drowning internally is not possible, this was likely an exaggeration from me trying to remember and retell the story over the years, maybe a mixup in my head or something. in actuality i would have just become really really sick, would have required surgery and shit but i wouldn't have drowned and died. apologies!	727	55960	bquclv	eo83lvp
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	from the other side, patients mother who had to kick and scream for a second opinion. my daughter fell off the bed when she was 8 months old. i checked her over and nothing was obviously wrong, she cried for a couple of minutes and then seemed okay. but i noticed as the evening went on she wasnt crawling much, she would start and give a very angry yell, not a pain cry but straight pissed off and sit back up. she went to sleep like normal and i started worrying if i should have taken her to the doctor right away. my hubs says she seems all right, lets see how shes doing in the morning. as soon as i wake up i decide im going to get her checked out. shes still acting normal except for not crawling, but shes playing and babbling and i figure im probably overreacting but i cant stop worrying. im at the doctor as soon as he opens, he tells me i should have taken her to the er immediately after any kind of fall but doesnt think anything is wrong. he checks her arm, cant find swelling, shes not reacting to him manipulate her arm, he says shes fine. i ask if she can be x-rayed and he says its not necessary. i answer that i want to be certain. he tells me its overkill but if it makes me feel better then i should do it. he writes a note for the er and we head there. er doctor examines her and tells me shes fine and that x-rays can be upsetting for babies and he doesnt think she needs it. he tells me if she continues acting funny for a few days i can bring her back. i ask what would happen if something was wrong and i let it go untreated that long. he shrugs and says they can do the x-ray if it makes me feel better. there was a broken bone in her wrist. the doctor actually apologized to me and gave me props for pushing for the x-ray when i felt something was wrong. when it comes to my kids, id definitely rather be safe than sorry.	91	55960	bquclv	eo8dw8a

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	"not a doctor, but about my wife. 26(f) at the time. my wife was 10 weeks pregnant, and started getting excruciating headaches. she was projectile vomiting even 1/2oz of water. could not keep anything down. so we go to the er at 1am monday morning. they give her pain meds and 2 bags of iv. diagnosis: morning sickness. monday night, same thing pain meds maybe taking a 10/10 down to 9/10, could still not eat/drink anything. so back to er monday night. they called her ob (older lady) who said to admit her. they put her in a room and gave her stronger pain meds and iv. still could not eat, every smell/sound made the headache worse. but managed to get it down to a 7/10 pain level. she was there 3 days and her ob never came to visit. on thursday she was discharged. we went home, and she said she wanted a slice of cheese pizza. she ate it and kept it down. but the next day the pain meds had worn off and she started vomiting and headache 10/10 again even with prescription meds. so back to the er on friday. this time when they called her ob office, a different ob was on call (young guy), he said admit her, and came to visit her at 1am. he asked hospital (hospital in town of 50k people with small icu) to get an mri. the hospital did not want to consult radiologist on weekend, because that would have been overtime. so she was medicated until monday morning when the ob had her down first in line for an mri. he came up half way through, said."" radiologist does not need to look at it, she has a cvt (blood clot in brain, from forehead to top of spine). he moved her to icu, then helicopter ride to big city hospital. i asked neurosurgeon if she would fully recover. he said if it came on quickly yes, if it was slow, probably always risk of some clot causing stroke later. after she gave birth, she had another mri, 100% gone. so. her first ob who never visited her, almost killed her by not listening. she was getting worse for the 7 days she was in/out of the hospital. not to mention when i ordered her records, her ob stated that she was drug seeking. needless to say, we switched to a high risk ob at big hospital and dumped the lazy ob."	39	55960	bquclv	eo8p1c8
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doc, but a second opinion likely saved my life a few years ago. its a long story, but hopefully it helps someone else not make the same mistakes i did. tl;dr: be your own advocate. if something feels off- it very well might be. id just switched to new health insurance and had picked my gp but hadnt been in to see her yet when i started getting sick. high fever, headache, fatigue, and back pain. i tried to rest it off but it was persistent so thought it best to see the doc just in case. i didnt have tons of time around work, so i popped into urgent care where they took a look and ran some x-rays and told me i had mild pneumonia. they prescribed some meds and told me to take it easy. i was 25 at the time and had unfortunately already experienced pneumonia and walking pneumonia in years prior. based on my previous experiences, i thought this was an odd diagnosis as i wasnt coughing at all. the last few times id had it i was hacking up a lung so to speak. but- i was busy and tired and trusted them so i went on my way. i took the meds, rested, stayed home, but i was still sick- getting worse. so i decided to make a proper appointment with a doc to get this really checked out because something felt wrong. unfortunately, my gps schedule was full for the next month+ so i saw the next available doc. well call her dr a. i went to see dr a about a week after urgent care. told her all my symptoms, how long itd been going on, etc. she told me it was regular old pneumonia and it was normal for my symptoms to get worse before they got better and that i should keep taking tylenol for the headaches and fever and monitor my temp (which was sitting at 100+ pretty much constantly). i told her id had pneumonia before and this felt different. she made me feel like a liar and an idiot for even suggesting she might not be right with my diagnosis. i left feeling bummed, angry and still very sick. a few days later, my fatigue was insane and i started to see these painful bright red bumps cropping up on my legs. id had hives before, and knew it wasnt that- no itching. im allergic to both sulfa and penicillin antibiotics so i was worried i was having a reaction to the ones they gave me. i went in to see dr a again. by then my legs were completely covered in huge raised pinkish red patches. plus i still had a fever, chills, back pain, fatigue and headache. when i arrived, she told me she didnt know what the red patches were. she brought in her student for a second opinion- he didnt know either. then she told me to go get blood drawn so she could run some tests. in the meantime, she told me to keep taking tylenol and monitor my fever. still treating me like a liar and an idiot. so i go down to get blood drawn which was excruciating. i was definitely dehydrated- they couldnt find a vein and tried both arms twice. id given blood many times before then and never cried, but after the fourth try i was almost sobbing. i had a 100+ fever at this point and told them to please just take it from the veins on my hand which they had refused because it hurt more. im like lady im already crying- just do it. they do it. no pain. i leave. i wait to hear from dr a with results. no word from her so i call. she says she didnt find anything and to keep monitoring. at this point i had been sick for weeks. im averaging 101 fever daily. ibuprofen isnt helping. i can barely walk. the red patches on my legs are spreading to my arms and torso. im so tired i can barely do anything and my back pain and headache are constant. im starting to notice breathing trouble- little bouts of too-fast breathing and my heart rate feels abnormally high. im miserable. i schedule a phone appointment with dr a because im too weak to go in. she misses it. that night, as im laying in bed with a 103+ fever that keeps going up, i start hyperventilating, or what feels like that. i cant catch my breath. i feel like i cant breathe. my heart rate is nuts. i know i need to go back to the hospital, i try to get up but i can barely stand. fun! so my boyfriend carries me down the stairs and around the corner to our car (apartment life!) and we head to urgent care (im poor and trying real hard to avoid er bills by that point). they see me immediately (yikes!) and after evaluating me and my chart for all of five minutes, this angel nurse brings in another doc who confirms that i need to go to the er now. angel nurse then proceeds to pop me in a wheelchair and personally wheel me to the er which was next door to avoid sitting me with ambulance bills, though its against their policy. once i get to the er im pumped wit fluids, given oxygen and am told my actual gp, who ive never met, will be in to see me very soon. several docs come by to take blood, evaluate, ask questions. they dont know what ive got but theyre going to figure it out. im so relieved! im admitted to the hospital and finally meet my actual gp in the morning. she is amazing and takes me seriously- asking questions and telling me what other departments shes looping in to help. she keeps popping back in to let me know where theyre at with a diagnosis. by late morning- shes figured it out: fungal pneumonia with a complication (the red splotches) erythema nodosum. the antibiotics id been given didnt do anything to help, which is why id been getting worse. everything worked out fine- i got the right meds and recovered. the red patches faded to bruises. but every time i think about that experience, i just wish i had been more insistent with dr a. i was so angry with her for not taking me seriously and not doing her job. her blas attitude towards my health, and my failure to push back, landed me in the freakin hospital. moral of the story: get a second opinion. and if your doc treats you like a liar- get a new one immediately. dont wait around and definitely dont see that doc again. edit: spelling!	44	55960	bquclv	eo8pfla

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i'll echo the doctor(s) here and say get your colonoscopy. you might think you're weak/anemic, or it might be a cancer that's on it's way to a good shot at killing you. you might be too proud or busy to fast and have someone stick a metal snake up your bot and you're on your way to having a cancer that is tough to beat and happy to kill you. my sister is fighting metastatic colon cancer right now. it's a bastard. all you have to do is get regular colonoscopies (they'll cut out any polyps) and in doing so, you're almost completely certain to never get that insidious shit. seriously, colon cancer is hard to beat once it's been going for a while but you can never have it thanks to getting a regularly scheduled colonoscopies.	34	55960	bquclv	eo8cjhl

"i work at a comprehensive cancer center. of all the requests our pathologists receive for second opinions, **10%** result in a change of diagnosis  either someone has cancer but was originally told everything was ok, or someone doesn't have cancer but was told they did, or someone was diagnosed with one type of cancer when it was really a different type (which will affect how it should be treated). as our chief of pathology once said, ""a second opinion is almost always a good idea. if your doctor is offended when you say you'd like to get a second opinion, find another doctor."""	36	55960	bquclv	eo8ph6p

doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	i'm a resident doctor. some lady was in the icu for bad myasthenia gravis. you get all weak and shit because your body attacks this dude in your blood you need to make your muscles work. myasthenic crisis is when this is bad enough that it affects your ability to breath. there's some cool shit you can do with these patients because they have progressive weakness that recovers over a short period of time; having them raise their eyes up and hold it and their eyes drift down or talk with them for a few minutes and watch their speech get progressively slurred. anyway, this lady had a pretty classic case and it was kinda neat to see one patient have all the findings. her story was classic, she sounded like a board exam question. misdiagnosed for months with bronchitis. someone else said it and i'd agree, a lot of it is urgent care and pcp mid levels and docs who don't have the time to actually talk to their patients. we exchanged her blood and got her on therapy and she's fine. nice lady, too.	69	55960	bquclv	eo89z8u
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	we had just moved to a new city. new job. new insurance. young, in our mid twenties. my husband was very fatigued and grumpy but we thought it was just adjusting to the new place. we setup.our new primary doc appointment 3 months is the soonest we can get in. 3 weeks later he's dropped 30 lbs. the primary won't get us in. i start calling every doctor in the city telling them something is really really wrong. someone fits him in that day and has us wait while they do a cbc. she refers us to an oncologist. the oncologist says its most likely lymphoma and does a bone marrow biopsy on the spot. comes back negative. schedules a lymph node. comes back negative. schedules something else i cant eveen recall now. hubby is getting sicker, losing 10lbs a week, still not treated. i start combing through every test and sending his file to everyone we know in the medical field. i notice he's got some blood markers for autoimmune disease. i ask the oncologist, he says thats true but if you treat the autoimmune with steroids it will hide the cancer. the next day a family friend gets back to is after looking over everything-she wants to know if he's seen a rheumatologist. i ignore the doctor and get the soonest rheumatologist appointment, 1 week out. 2 days later my husband has a mini stroke. in the hospital the rheumatologist diagnosis him with hemolytic anemia lupus and eventually every kind of severe lupus involvement you can have. stage 3 kidney disease. cns vasculitis. lung scarring. sjogrens. they put him on 1000mg steroids by iv and chemo to knockout his immune system. after a few scary secondary infections he never had another flare up in 6 years. oh and there never was any cancer.	70	55960	bquclv	eo8cxe9
doctors of reddit, whats yourthank god they came in for a second opinion moment?	not a doctor but im a paramedic student who was told this by a professor. what happened was a bar fight broke out and as everyone was leaving the guests were getting checked at the door were you involved in the fight? were you hurt? came across a couple and the man had a hole in his shirt and was asked to lift his shirt to see a cut. the paramedics wanted to take him to the hospital to make sure he was alright but he insisted no. his girlfriend tried to get him to go but still no bueno. the paramedics called the doc and got him to talk to the man and convinced him to go. lucky he went because he was stabbed and it punctured his liver and he wouldve died in the next 3-4hours. the guy didnt even know he was stabbed nor did he feel it do to the adrenaline.	96	55960	bquclv	eo86jqw

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	thank god for my nosey neighbors. i always used to hate how nosey they were. until this happened. when i was about 10 i was riding my bike outside. my parents always let me ride my bike outside during the summer, but only up and down the street we were on. one day, a man in a fan was parked across the street. he called to me, asking me if i had seen his dog and could help him find it. me, being a dumb child, offered to help him find it, and i started walking towards his van. my neighbor, and older white lady, came bolting out of her house hooting and yelling, telling the guy to back off. the dude got back in his car in a hurry and took off, and it wasn't until many years later that i realized how bad that situation could have been.	1506	49997	bojhpr	eniy6n8
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"was a bouncer at a club in la for a minute in the 90's. stopped some dudes clearly affiliated (in a gang) at the door after they refused security checks. after a few minutes of their threats & manson lamps they left spewing all sort of warnings. a little later it starts to wind down and because it's a little slow & we're overstaffed so i start to drink. i get a bit drunk (not wasted, but sleepy-buzzed) so i tell my buddy i'm going to go lay down in the back of his car for a while. a few minutes after lying down i realize i have to piss. i get out and stumble a few into a spot between a guard gate (for a parking lot) and a building for a little privacy (there's a few dozen people milling around in front of the club). i'm about 25 feet away from the club's entrance and just off an alleyway. while i'm relieving myself, a dude runs right past in front of me, around the guard booth to my rear, and unloads a 9mm (recovered rounds from back seat/trunk/roof/bumper) into the back seat of the car i'd just crawled out of. ""bam bam bam bam."" unloading into the car. he then turns, runs right back past me, and down the alley into the night. don't think he saw me at all. nothing really came of it. except my partner was convinced i was a ""marked man"" and refused to be near me for a year or so. edit: holy crap, i kind of expected this to get buried. this was los angeles. i was about 25 (almost 50 now) so some specifics are long gone - but i remember this: my buddy was genuinely terrified by this, i don't think he knew anything about it (in fact he seemed to interpret the event as a larger conspiracy to have me snuffed - not some random pissed off dude making a point/getting jumped in) and because he ditched the car/wouldn't take my calls it got left at that. for those concerned with the car - it was, like, a 1980's rusted out sedan.maybe a $500 car. details about the slugs/number of rounds fired were relayed to me later by third parties (my friend and i were known in the neighborhood, people were talking about it). thank you for the well wishes. honestly though, this wasn't even the first time i was shot at (it's been a long strange trip). edit 2: also, i tried to argue later that it's just as likely the guy was shooting at someone else across the street and that the car just got in the way. but there were holes all through that thing. back seat had 4/5, another 2/3 went into the back window and ended up in the backs of the front seats, another 2/3 rounds went right into the trunk. i honestly don't know if he was a terrible shot, or if he hit right what he was aiming for. apologies if i'm doing this wrong, i suck at reddit."	5303	49997	bojhpr	enhyzd5
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was about 10 my grandfather was dying from complications of his heart issues and mentel deterioration. i didn't know him very well as the last time we had been in contact him was when i was a baby. my father never liked him and didn't bother coming with me and my mother to visit him in the hospital. when we got there he was resting peacefully and my mother went forward and whispered some words to him, i imagine about his current state of health. i hang back a little bit because the creepy old guy whome i didn't recall seeing in my whole life really freaked me out. regaurdless of my anxiety my mom said i should approach grandpa and share some nice words with him. i understood by how sad my mother was that i shouldn't argue too much so i approached his hospital bed to speak to him. he didnt seem concious at all so i just did what my mother did, leaning forward and just whisper some nice things to him. things took turn when mid sentence his eyes flair opon and he stares at me making me stop what im saying. my heart dropped into my ass when he looked at me because it was pure hatred in his eyes. as soon as we made eye contact he bolted upright from his bed and wrapped his hands around my neck and started throttling me as hard as he could. i barely even remember what happened but my mom was screaming for a nurse. and grandpa kept yelling at me while shaking my neck violently ""f*cking betrayal you betray me* and then he died. almost as fast as it began it was over. his grip loosened and he flat lined. my mother was inconsolable and i was extremely confused and crying out of sheer trauma at the situation. later after we managed to calm down a nurse explained to my mother that his severe dementia had left him barely coherent and it was likely he had thought i was someone else. i didn't learn this until several years later but my mother suspected my grandfather saw my father in me. my father was an alcoholic womanizor and fairly abusive in my earlier childhood and my grandfather resented him for it. i guess i look a little too much like my dad."	563	49997	bojhpr	enin57k

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i have a friend who had a party at his parents house when he was in high school that a ton of random people went to. he got super drunk during the party and went upstairs to go to sleep, knowing that his friends would watch the party for him. my friend woke up from his nap to a guy from his school sitting on top of him stabbing him death. he was stabbed seven times before it stopped and he laid there on the bed dying. the only reason he is still alive is because his best friend came upstairs to ask him if it was alright if he made a frozen pizza and found him. the assailant was put in jail and recently was released and it scares me to know that a guy who wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone (said during the trial), is still out there free.	1586	49997	bojhpr	eni1lws

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was 14 and outside in my garage petting my cat. it was november so it was already dark by 5pm. someone opened the door behind me without me hearing, grabbed me by my ponytail and starting dragging me outside. they hit me on my head with a brick and knocked me out. pulled me halfway around my house when (i'm guessing this is when) they stabbed me on the left side of my stomach. this must have brought me out of my daze, because my mom said she heard me scream from inside where she and my brother and sister were in the kitchen. they came out the front door and saw me bleeding out on the side walk, called 911. had 12 stitches (double layer) a severe concussion, and whiplash. didn't eat and hardly slept for a week. they never found them. edit: somehow believed for nearly 14 years i was 15 when this happened, turns out i was 14. edited to correct. 2nd edit: thank you so much for my first gold! 	28843	49997	bojhpr	enhsxzf
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was riding in a train across eastern europe. i was running low on money and even though i had been warned that a woman should not travel alone in second class seating i did not spring for first class. i was sitting alone in one of the compartments that seats six. this was also a mistake and a very stupid one to sit alone. eventually the train stopped and a man got on - he was very drunk. he came into my compartment and i guess thought i looked like his ex-wife. he attacked me. if it were not for the fact that this particular station was the border between two countries i would be dead. instead border patrol from both countries were on the train and while i was unable to scream, the door was open and at least a half a dozen uniformed men jumped him and saved me. i was in the hospital for a little while but recovered. at one point during the trial, one of the cops asked me if i wanted him and his buddies to hold the guy down while i hit him. i thought he was joking. so i said no, go ahead you do it. i was also joking. but it turns out they took it seriously and were about to! i did put a stop to that at least. but they were so offended that someone from their country would attack a young female american tourist. they were furious with him. so many people there depended upon tourism	16481	49997	bojhpr	enhotwv

"i was doing volunteer work in central america, working in a really bad area of the capitol city--it was a slum built on top of the city's garbage dump. the whole place reeked of trash, and there were large metal cylinders coming up out of the ground throughout the area to vent the gas from decomposing garbage underground. as a fellow volunteer and i walked down a dirt path, two men approached us. i'd never seen them before. they were acting strangely, but i just thought they were drunk or high--a lot of people in the area drank rubbing alcohol to get drunk, since it was cheaper than beer or liquor. over time, drinking the rubbing alcohol would really mess with their brains. as the men got closer, they began acting really friendly--too friendly. one of them came close to me, trying to put his arm around my shoulders. at first, it seemed like the behavior of a guy who gets happy and friendly when he's drunk. however, an alarm went off in my head, and i gently--but firmly--pushed him away. i tried to make it seem lighthearted and playful, like, ""hey, man! how's it going?"" (affectionate shove.) i didn't want to make a scene, since i was a gringo; i didn't want to seem like an ugly american. this went on over and over down the whole path--he'd get close, i'd shove him off, he'd come close again. finally, my friend and i came to a fork in the path, and we went one way while they went another. after we got to the house of some people we knew, we told them about the two guys. (i was so focused on protecting myself, i didn't even notice much of what was happening with the other guy.) they said, ""oh, everyone around here knows him. that's his routine--he comes up to people, pretends to be friendly, puts him arm around them, then pulls out his knife and stabs them in the stomach."" i was *that* close to getting stabbed to death."	6699	49997	bojhpr	enhy33u
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"wow - a serious post i can actually comment on. it wasn't a murder attempt (maybe it was.?) but a stabbing attempt i guess. happened when i was around 12-13 years old. i was taking a lifeguarding course at a local pool with a friend of mine which had about 16 people in the class. the age ranges in the class can vary, and we probably had a mix of people between 12-18, but most were somewhere in the middle. there was this one kid, probably 16-17 that really stood out to me and my friend as the typical ""school shooter"" type. very solemn look on his face at all times, socially awkward and extremely quiet. we both got really strong serial killer vibes from him. it's just one of those instincts you feel that tells you ""something isn't right"" we made a few jokes between ourselves about it, as we both noticed it almost immediately and were fairly uncomfortable being around him. this lasted for probably the first 2 hours of the 4 hour class. at that point we were asked to switch from pool instruction into a classroom, and had about 20 minutes to change and get into the classroom. as we are all changing, this guy kept looking over at me and my friend - we tried not to make eye contact with him and just ignore it but we were getting extremely uncomfortable with how intensely the guy was staring. we were the only 3 in the changeroom and were intent on leaving as fast as possible. eventually, my friend makes eye contact with the guy, who screams something along the lines of ""stop looking at me"", pulling a switchblade out of his swim bag and lunging at my friend. i stood there, somewhat frozen as this was happening and didn't really know what to do - whether to try and help or run. my friend ended up blocking the initial lunge with the locker door, and he sprinted towards the front exit of the changeroom, with this enraged knife-wielding teenager chasing him. when my friend had made it out of the changeroom the maniac turned around and started chasing me down. with pool deck floors, they are extremely slippery and almost impossible to run on but 12 year old me wasn't exactly worried about that at this point. &#x200b; i had to run from the changeroom/locker area, through the bathrooms, through a shower room and then onto the pool deck (the only other exit) all i remember is him catching up to me and he must have been within reach at some point on this 100m run, but i remember turning around once i made it on the pool deck and the guy was gone. i was half dressed, and basically still sprinting towards the lifeguard office. &#x200b; once there i found our instructor and told him what happened - and he didn't believe me. he said i was lying and was just picking on the kid, nothing happened. etc. so i told him to try and find my friend with me (i was panicking, hyperventilating, but apparently not believable). my friend was still out in the lobby now with a ton of concerned parents around trying to figure out what was going on. turns out when he blocked the knife with the locker door the knife got his forearm and he was bleeding pretty badly (not arterial, but probably a 6"" gash on the hairy part of your arm) immediately my instructor ushered us away and called the police, building went into lockdown, etc. &#x200b; to this day i have no idea what happened to that kid - he never came back to the class, and the police didn't find him that night. i'm assuming he got arrested but i never heard about it. it was probably the closest i ever came to getting killed and i'm not exactly sure why/how he didn't stab me, or if he slipped and fell before making it to me. he was considerably larger than me and definitely faster. &#x200b; all i know now is i should trust my instincts more with people - they might turn out to be true. &#x200b; **tl;dr: almost got stabbed by a knife-wielding teenager in a lifeguarding course, ran out and the teacher didn't believe me, found friend with a bloody arm and the kid disappeared.**"	802	49997	bojhpr	enhufha
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i don't know if this counts because i didn't find out until ten years later. when i was 7-8 years old, when my parents broke up. my dad apparently tried to kill me and my mother, along with everyone in the household at time. including the cats. he failed to get in house. the 2 times he tried.	4252	49997	bojhpr	enhm2rw
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	so, i did not know it was a murder attempt at the time, but looking back now - it was a definite possibility. in middle and high school my next door neighbors were a boy one year younger than me (john) and his younger brother who was four years younger than him (nathan.) my own younger brother and i had a similar age gap, and we found ourselves around each other all the time. now i am a female and the rest of the group was all males, so there were just naturally times when the three of them would hang and i wouldn't be around. &#x200b; one day my little brother who was around 9 at the time comes home with a porno mag and is telling me about the porn videos they were watching as a little unit. now guys, i have no idea if this is something that is done in your pre/adolescent circles, but it freaked me the hell out and i told my mom. my mom then went and told their single dad. what i didn't know was their dad was an abusive piece of shit who beat both of those boys so badly that they couldn't go to school for weeks. no, we didn't call the police - we just filed it away and knew from that point forward to never tattle. i still carry the guilt of telling on john and nathan with me to this day, because it set off a chain of events i would have never anticipated. &#x200b; as we got older, the brothers started acting out more and more; bullying other kids, vandalism, weird shit like toying with road kill. as the level headed female in the group i opposed all of these things, and a faction emerged with me and the other neighborhood kids on one side, and john and nathan on the other just fucking shit up and causing trouble. one day i had done something to piss off john, and he came at me with a large chef's knife. i didn't have shoes on, so i took off running through the backyard and crossed into the neighbor's. john was hot on my tail, trailing me by maybe 4 feet when i fell down. there was some sort of exposed pvc drainage pipe that had been shattered at the top that i didn't see it and ran over, my foot was sliced open immediately and i went down screaming. i think it shocked him; my screaming, the sudden change of pace, and the blood. he stopped, laughed at me, then ran home- presumably so he didn't get his ass whipped. &#x200b; after i took care of myself, i told my mom what happened with the knife. she had started dating someone new, and i think this was the sort of feather that broke the camels back. we moved to another part of town in the same district about a ten-minute drive from our old house. around that exact time we moved in, a new family moved into the house on the other side of john and nate. &#x200b; things continued down a bad path for those boys. over the next year they got in trouble with school, and would randomly show up at our new house locked out of their own. the year i went off to college i received a panicked phone call from my mom telling me to look up the local newspaper, john had murdered the girl who had moved into the other house next door to him. it was really grisley too, he chopped her up and stuffed her into a trunk that sat outside in his dad's car all day while a family picnic was happening. he and his little brother got caught trying to throw the trunk into the river from a bridge at night by a cop who happened to be driving by. i just thought to myself that could have been me! both brothers have been locked up for what has to be about ten years at this point, they were both tried and convicted as adults. everyone in our town just wants to see them burn in hell, but honestly the only thing i can think about is how it might have been different if our family reported the abuse from the onset - maybe their little minds would'nt have warped from a tender age.	2714	49997	bojhpr	enhz0am
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i got jumped by two grown men when i was a freshmen in college. i was walking back from my friends house and it was about 30 past midnight. one posed as a homeless man asking for a dollar and the other had on a security jacket like he worked for the universitys safety patrol. when i passed the homeless guy saying i had nothing to give him, i saw the security guy walking towards me. this is when i felt a rear neck choke hold and the security guy started whaling on me. i had my bag on me, but like i said, i literally had nothing on me. they couldnt take me down to the ground (surprisingly.i mustve had an adrenaline rush). the guy posing as a homeless guy said open the back pack, find anything lets dip. this lasted about 2-3 minutes, but it felt like forever. the whole time i could feel something pointy in my back, but i just like to think that the guy was extremely excited, and it wasnt a knife. luckily, it was right outside my friends house and a couple of them came running out when they heard the commotion. the guys fled immediately when 3 of my friends came sprinting towards them. i still look behind me when i walk home alone.	10980	49997	bojhpr	enh2d1h
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"well idk if this counts as an attempt or not but my wife, my kids and myself went to church one time and we ran into one of my wife's old ""flings"", this guy followed my wife around and our daughter and kept trying to talk to them. so i confronted him about it and told him to back off. as we were leaving he makes sure to yell across the parking lot telling my daughter good bye. my wife forces me in to the car and we leave. so i message the guy on facebook to ask him what his problem is and he tells me that my wife and daughter are his friends and i have no right to tell them who to be friends with. i told him again to back off our i would call the police. fast forward a week (i worked every other sunday) i get a call from the pastor saying that they had to call the police on the guy because he was causing drama looking for me. when they arrested him he had a back pack with him that had a sawed off shotgun, a meth pipe and some meth in it."	2580	49997	bojhpr	eni6fn2
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was two weeks into my first job as a 16 year old (at a smoothie establishment that should be known to nba fans), we were robbed. it was late, and my coworker's friends had been playing pranks on her all day, so when i saw someone burst through the door, i thought it was just that. until, that is, i had something metal pressed against my back and an arm wrapped around my chest. the robber gave the whole stereotypical ""give me all the money"" spiel, and ordered us to go into the back room, kneel down, and face the wall. as i was kneeling and hearing him walking towards us, time seemed to slow down. thankfully, i had been refilling juices whenever he came in, and so the door to the back room was partially blocked by a heavy cart. with whatever substance he was on, he wasn't coordinated enough to get past it to us, so he fled. he was followed by my coworker's husband and caught. when he was caught, they found an industrial sized pipe wrench wrapped tightly in his fist, so that he could get a stronger grip when swinging. i'm so glad that cart was there. once a year or so, i would look him up in the parish prison roster to see if he was still in jail. one year, he suddenly wasn't. i later found him named in a lawsuit as having stabbed his cellmate a half dozen times while the guy was asleep. definitely doesn't seem like the nicest of people. nine years later, i'm still unpacking this incident in therapy - it's why i dont like walking around cities at night or sitting where i can't see the door."	8610	49997	bojhpr	enhg6hp
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	chilling with the bros drinking at a park. as we drive off to leave, a car coming our way almost hits us. driver obviously reacts like wtf and i guess the other car noticed. they turned around and caught up to us at a stop sign. other driver asked if we had a problem, we told them stop driving like assholes. then their back window rolls down and two guys in the back draw glocks with drum magazines. we just kind of froze up at first but then our driver pulled off hastily. later found out those guys got arrested for shooting someone else that same day.	10342	49997	bojhpr	enhcz5l
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"my dad was a meth addict. he did lots of fucked up things - dropping me off at trap houses to have ""sleepovers"" with other ""coke babies"", living in a house full of animal shit and hoarding. he sicked his pitbull on a black child. he was a real fucking character. one night he came looking for my mom and i at our place. mom wasn't there. grandma was babysitting me. i was sleeping in bed when somebody started to try and open my window. it was locked, but they kept jamming something into the bottom to try and force it open. at the same time, i heard the living room door being tried by somebody else. my grandma snuck into my room in her nightgown, apparently woken up by the same thing, and told me say nothing. don't even whisper. we laid under my bed while a group of men shouted for my mom to come out, slammed their hands on the windows to try and break them, and jumped on my grandma's car. she called the police and barely whispered into the phone. eventually the cops arrived and the men scattered. long story short, my dad and his other methhead friends came to the house with guns and knives with every intention to kill me and my mother because she was going to get custody of me. if my mom wasn't so vigilant with locks (we had three different kinds on the front and back doors), we would have died."	41509	49997	bojhpr	enhirhl
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	if you're from the area i'm from this will probably sound familiar. but i got absolutely black out drunk at an end of the year/graduation party and ended up having to get taken home early. later that night another student at the party ended up stabbing and killing 5 people. turns out he had mental issues (schizophrenia) and thought everyone at the party was a werewolf/vampire who threatened his life. he never went to jail but ended up being founded non criminally responsible instead.	13071	49997	bojhpr	enhjnv3

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i was 19 driving through the centre of johannesburg, south africa from wits university. during rush hour. loads of cars and people. i was winding up my window (old golf) when 4 guys come up and surround my car. in the car was myself, my sister, and my three friends. as i was rolling up my window the guy at my window reaches into my car and switches the ignition off and goes for my keys, all the while yelling ""phones and wallets now or you die"" i did the only natural thing and grabbed his arm and hold him in the car window fighting for my keys. he pulled out and came down hard on my arm. twice. second time something snapped and i let go. i thought i had broken my arm. he flees and all his guys go to. my mates jump out and start chasing them down. i found the keys on the road just outside my door. i can't drive, arm is broken. i jump into the back seat as my mate returns with blood on his shirt. he jumps in the driver's seat and pulls off like a madman. all of this within 2 minutes, at a redlight with about 30 cars around us, no one stopped to help, they just drove around us. only then did i realise i had been stabbed twice on the arm, the second time the guy had severed all of my tendons in my forearm and there is blood everywhere. like dexter splatter patterns on the seats, windows, and myself. luckily i had a roll of bandage in the car, wrapped my arm and got to the hospital near my place (about 20km at 17:00 rush hour) in about 20 minutes. i was in the operating theatre within an hour of being stabbed. i could have been stabbed in the chest or neck, luckily it was just my arm. fully recovered with an interesting scar and about 95% of my former mobility."	389	49997	bojhpr	enij9yx
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	in my late teens, i used to buy my weed from random dudes in the projects (low income housing.) one day we gave some money to a guy named 40. he took it and went inside one of the buildings. we waited in the car for several minutes. we started to think he had taken our money and left. right about that time, a car full of coked-up white dudes pulled up beside ours. apparently my friend owed them money. they pointed a gun at him and said that if he had enough money to buy weed, then he could pay them back. i really thought they were going to shoot us and just drive off like it was nothing, and i hadn't even done anything wrong. i thought i was gonna pee my pants. right about that time, 40 came back out with our weed and an even bigger gun. he scared them away and then we went back to his apartment and smoked a blunt. what a good man. turns out he was only selling weed because he had a 6-year-old daughter and that was the only way he knew to give her a better life than he had. i babysat his daughter occasionally for the rest of that summer. i really hope she got a decent childhood and that her dad stayed safe and out of jail. **tldr; almost got shot but was saved by random drug dealer who turned out to be a decent fellow.**	9134	49997	bojhpr	enhumck
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was out with a few friends, and with us was a girl that had just broken up with a psychopath (we didn't know he was a psychopath, we found out that night). we were just walking back home from a restaurant, it was about 1 am, and the guy came running out of nowhere, i don't know how he knew where and when to meet us. he ran to the girl, lifted her shirt up and stabbed her in the gut, literally splitting her belly open like a fish, and then ran off. this whole thing happened really quickly, so we were all in shock. the girl was holding her own intestines in her hands and she was so shocked that she didn't even seem scared, wasn't screaming or anything. she just stood there. we called an ambulance and they managed to somehow put everything back and sew her up. this happened about 3 years ago and she still has pretty serious problems with her digestive tract, can't eat certain things and that kind of stuff. that image of her just standing in the middle of the pathway holding her own guts will remain stuck in my head forever. the guy got 13 years in jail btw. edit: now that i think about it, a big part of why they broke up was his constant abuse towards her weight. she wasn't even fat, just a bit on the chubby side, i wouldn't even call that overweight, but he would always tell her that she had a big gut. that was almost an obsession for him. so maybe the fact that he stabbed her in the abdomen is a symbolic action of some sort. i don't know what was in that fuckhead's brain and i honestly don't even want to know.	15581	49997	bojhpr	enhia85
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	walking home from my pregnant gf's house at the time. honestly it wasn't a bad neighborhood. well i'm walking basically just minding my own business, passed these guys maybe 3 or four of them , they were heading the other direction on the other side of the street. something told me to look back and right as i did that, one of them had a gun pointed to the back of my head. i turned around fully and was just like yo! they were like give us your money etc i had a wad of dollars and not sure if it was quick thinking but i stuck my thumb in between the cash pulled it out and threw it on the road and it scattered. as they went to pick it up i bolted. these assholes chased me. i just run to some dudes house who luckily for me he was cool let me in closed the door and called the cops. a few weeks later those same dudes were arrested for robbery and killing the person they robbed. these guys were from a neighboring neighborhood. so ya.	1675	49997	bojhpr	enhyjck
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	when i was a kid i was riding my bike home from a friends house at sunset. i rode past the community pool which had been closed for a couple months. there was a car in the lot with a guy in it. i didnt think much of it as i continued the trek home. i cut through the local elementary parking lot which has gates. i get like 20 yards past the gate and i see that car pull up at the bottom. thinking thats odd. anyhow he backs out away from the gate. my spidey senses were kinda tingling at this point. i get up to the school and head towards teacher parking lot which is my standard direction. as im about to turn the corner i see headlights from the parking lot. i stop and peek around the corner and its that fucking guy again. i flip my bike around and start going the long way around the school. he sees me but just gets back in his car. and starts driving around the front of the school. i camp in these bushes, heart pounding. he is slowly driving up and down the front of the school keeping an eye on the teachers lot. another car comes down the street and he has to move his dumb car out of their way. as soon as he does i just blasted up to the street and full tilt flew my bike into some random open garage. so im hiding in the garage waiting for him to come around again. but he doesnt. i give it a few minutes then decide to pop my head out. still no one. ok im a few blocks from home just gotta go for it. bust out the bike and start hauling ass home. not half a fucking block later this dude turns the corner on me. i just veer my bike into some random lawn and run up to the front door. i look at him and hes just in the street staring at me. i grip the front door handle praying to any and every god these people dont lock their doors. i see his reverse lights flicker and i know he just put it in park. i just rip that door open, run inside and slam it. two old people just sitting there. i look at them and im like some dude is trying to get me out there. they dont completely believe me cause they barely react to what i said. but they dont kick me out or anything either. im watching the dude from their window and hes just chilling. then the grandpa looking dude gets up from his lazy boy and opens the curtain to look for himself. when he does this the asshat in the car just leaves. old guy is like well looks like hes gonna leave. im like im not leaving for a bit. so i hang out for 10 min and no creepy abductor car to be seen. i assume he figured i called the cops. finally im like i have to get home. this is before cell phones were common for average people. i hop on my bike and i swear it felt like i drove 35 mph the whole way home. get home and tell my parents. im exhausted and in complete shock. they basically brush me off. im stunned that every adult i interacted with acted like i was crazy. i basically never talked about it again it was so traumatic to talk about at the time. that image of him in his car while i held the door handle to the random house is permanently seared into my brain. to this day its still as crystal clear as if it happened yesterday. like 18-20 years later i decided to confront my parents as to why they didnt do anything that day. they were like wtf you talking about. i explained it far better than i couldve when i was a kid in complete shock. anyhow, with the current, more expansive explanation my mother b-b-b-broke down. she started crying at this public restaurant cause she saw how serious i was when i was like how could you ignore what i said that day. as well as talked about how that morphed my stranger danger techniques for better or worse. thankfully i was on the verge of puberty and ended up becoming a giant human being so my actual fears diminished quickly as i could defend myself. until i moved away from that town however, i looked every day for that god damned car. never saw it again. i would fantasize about what id like to do if i ever found that guy, hell, i still do. tldr dude tried abducting me at like 10-12 years old. got lucky hiding in random garage and some old peoples house. never got any level of justice edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger	6550	49997	bojhpr	enhnt9w
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"my husband and i live above our place of business. out alarm company called us at 3am to say there was a motion detect alert, just one, in a weird place. we assumed it was a mouse but went to reset/check it out. husband ended up face to face with a burglar who was on his way out the window he had broken. he ran back inside, i called 911 and we heard mad chaos going on in the depths of the building. so much crashing and smashing. burglar monkey climbed a 10' iron gate, bodily smashed through two sets of commercial grade glass doors and was outside again. my husband was like yeah fuck this dude, tore after him and tackled him. he got him on the ground and pinned him. bear in mind the whole time i'm narrating to 911, and chasing around in panties and tank top. i was a bit behind my husband, in the middle of the street about 15' away when a minivan squealed around the corner. it was his gf/getaway driver. i luckily missed it- i was super focused on reading the license plate which was one of those cutesy font out of state ones and therefore hard to read but she yelled ""get the fuck off him or i'm running your bitch over."" then she tried to. the audio and video i had to watch for the trial was horrifying. i had blocked it out nearly completely, and really didn't remember how close it was. she guns the engine at me, i throw my hands up in front of my face when i realize what she's doing and scream, and jump out of the way with inches to spare. he jumped in and off they went. he bled all over my husband (yikes) and eventually the dna and the partial plate info nailed them. they're both in prison. addendum, trials suck. eta: to make this clear, do not do this. adrenaline is a hell of a drug and it's best to not fight burglars! we definitely both could have died. it was the third time this fucker had broken in and caused $xx,xxx amount of mostly uninsured damage and inventory loss and that definitely contributed to the whole thing. he wouldn't have stopped doing it. he was a pro and was doing upwards of 3 jobs a night most nights, all over the state, for years."	20690	49997	bojhpr	enhonhv
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	not sure if this counts but i was a lifeguard on one of the local beaches. i was out patrolling in the truck by myself and got a call for a medical aid at one of the condos behind the boardwalk. i grab everything and head over. this is fairly unusual but we do respond from time to time to stuff off the beach since we're closer and do what we can until medics show up. knock on the guys door, identify myself, and then enter residence. it's a younger guy, clearly on drugs, blood around the area of his wrists, and he's just looking at me dumbfounded. as i begin to ask him what the problem is my supervisor walks in, grabs my shoulder, and basically pulls me out of the condo. turns out this guy had called in about committing suicide and threatened to kill anyone that entered the residence. obviously they shouldn't have sent me in there and it ended up being a pretty big deal with people getting reprimanded for telling me to respond instead of waiting for police.	173	49997	bojhpr	enhvopp

"i was 15-16, at a party. i went outside on a balcony for a smoke with someone i was talking to, and there was already a guy out there. we chatted as a group, and the friend went back inside. i started chatting with the guy who was already out there, who seemed a little funny. he started talking about how he was in the army for a little bit but got kicked out, then pulled out a big knife and handed it to me. i looked at it and gave it back to him. at that point he pushed me against the edge of the balcony, put the knife to my neck, looked me in the eye, and said ""do you know why i wanted to join the army? i wanted to fucking kill people, man. people just like you"". he then made a slicing sound with his mouth and took the knife away, then started laughing. i went inside, grabbed my gf, and we locked ourselves in a bedroom. he ended up smoking a lot of meth that night and was kneeing holes in the wall and beating on the door. i slept with my knife under my pillow. the next morning he seemed totally normal, except for the fact that he had turned his jeans into short shorts. fucking scary looking back on it. edit: originally put age as 14, but realized later it was closer to 15/16. also, i found out later that the guy got kicked out in basic training."	4182	49997	bojhpr	enh8sw1
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	serious: i had a guy high on both meth and acid break into my apartement in college. somehow he was convinced he lost his glasses inside. im doing dishes when my door gets slammed open. next thing i know he is behind me im being choked to death in my kitchen. as i was loosing consciousness i grabbed my roomates acrylic bong and frantically swung over my shoulder into his face. the bong broke but did nothing as the guy was choking me even harder. so i swung it again. because the bong broke the first time i was hitting the guy with a 6 inch claw of acrylic glass. afterward his scalp and part of his cheek were hanging off the side of his face. essentially i scalped him with a bong. so i chase the guy out of my house. there is easily 2 feet of snow outside. he tries walking back to his house through a cemetary as a shortcut (seriously ). and he passes out in the cemetary. the police only found him because i called the cops and they followed the blood and footprints through the snow. and thats the part i was supprised about the most. i hit the guy on his scalp. there isnt much blood in a scalp compared to most the body. but my kitchen was covered in blood. his blood was on my refridgerator, counter, floor and celing. it was almost as traumatic to clean it. my roomates were gone for winter break. thank god my roomates girlfriend came over and helped me. now as for the guy. the cops couldnt charge him for 2 days because he needed blood transfusions. he was charged with assault, breaking and entering and attempted murder. (and he def had drugs on him too) not sure what he got convicted of but he went to jail for 4 years. edit: sorry for the confusion over acrylic vs glass guys. im not the biggest stoner it seems. i guess the bong was just glass not acrylic.	13435	49997	bojhpr	enh215i
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"my sister had this one friend when we were growing up i always got a bad vibe from. she would try to pick on my little brother but i would always stop her. i was 8, she was 10. once we were at a lake and all the kids were swimming. i swam out to the deep roped off part but i was still little and really shouldn't have. she kept acting weird and getting closer to me making this weird laugh. she pushed me off the wooden pole in the water and i got scared and started to swim back but she came up behind me and pushed me under the water. it didn't click at first that she was trying to drown me but after she aggressively pushed me under the 3rd time i had this crazy moment of clarity. it was like the world slowed down ever so briefly. i relaxed and let myself sink, swam underneath her, and came up behind her. i grabbed her hair and shoved her face into the water, keeping my legs on her back so her body couldn't rise. i waited until her struggling slowed down and let her come up. i waited in the water saying nothing, bracing myself for her retaliation but she just looked panicked and swam back to shore. i told my sister who had already expressed that the girl was weird. we confronted her together and she just looked really dazed. in a monotone voice she said ""i'm sorry, i didn't know it would be like that."" it wasn't until i replayed those words in my mind later that i realized what she was saying was 'sorry i tried to drown you, it wasn't until i was almost drowned myself that i realized how horrible it is to do to someone.'"	28110	49997	bojhpr	enhdq3i
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was shot while working in a small independent video game shop. this place was a very small store in a somewhat sketchy area, but we had never had problems before. on the night in question, a gentleman came in and, without saying a word, goes straight into the porn section/caged off area. the gentleman emerges from the porn cage with his selections and proceeds to toss his selections on the counter. now this part is very important. i go to retrieve the discs for the pornography in question, which we kept in giant cd binders that held about 500-750 discs when completely full, which they were in this case, since we had just received some new stuff. as i turn to place the binders on the counter, i hear what i now know to be the hammer being cocked. at the time i thought nothing of it since it is a video game store and we had demos on and available for people to play. as i turned to face the customer, i can now see the customer has a gun out and pointed at me. a moment or two passed with neither of us saying anything, and me holding the binders in front of my chest. and then he pulled the trigger. i don't remember much else after that, mostly because i was face down on the ground trying very hard not to move, breath obviously, or make any kind of noise. i hear him go through the register (he got all $60 in there) and then go through the game cases (he stole at least five empty psp game cases) before he bolted. according to the emt's who tended to me, the bullet traveling through the stack of three completely full(ish) cd binders slowed the bullet down enough to the point where it hardly penetrated. it only went about 1-2 inches deep and i somehow managed to get hit in the one area of my chest/shoulder area where nothing vital was. tl;dr guy shot me at work in order to rob the place, porn saved my life. \*edit: spelling and grammar errors \*edit: here is my proof (warning: giant hairy chest and the scar looks a blurry nipple, so slightly nsfw) [http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz](http://imgur.com/a/5vfbz)	990	49997	bojhpr	enibgzm
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was pushed off a cliff by a former friend at his own birthday party (he was 14 and i was like 12), we were on a hike just the two of us and he took a detour and we reached a steep cliff and he just up and pushed me off. i caught on to a tree root that was jutting out (there was a big tree growing right where i fell, the root grew in a way that part of it was exposed and made a surprisingly good handle). he didn't catch on and simply left me there. i was there for about an hour if i had to guess until someone else was alerted to my presence and managed to get me back up. i still have nightmares about it. i don't know why he did it, but he had been an insane asshole to me for a long time in retrospect. edit: nobody believed me when i told this to them, so he got off scot free. i haven't seen him since, but i'm pretty sure he's still alive.	1733	49997	bojhpr	eni5asp
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	some time ago when i was like 14 years old i found a second handed guitar advertised online for a very cheap price, i wen't ahead and contacted the seller, who ended up being someone who studied in the same school i studied in, so i went to his house and found that the guitar had no strings, which was not a problem to me but we got to an agreement of him putting new strings on the guitar if i went with him downtown to purchase them, to which i said yes. we went downtown, got the new strings, and while getting back, a random guy approached us and started asking for money, i paid no attention but then this random guy pulled out a handgun and pointed at us, he said that he was the guy in charge of the zone that we happened to be walking around and that we must pay him in order to cross by. i was kind of in shock but then the guy i was with (the guitar seller) started a discussion with the guy who had the gun and while they were doing that, the seller told me to run, and with no doubt i startet to run away as fast as i could right through the middle of a street and between running cars, something obiously dumb, but i was in shock, so that was my reaction. i remember that when i started to run, that guy still had the gun pointing at us, so while i ran i was weirdly expecting the sound of a shoot, but luckily that didn't happen. &#x200b; edit: changed 'fire gun' to 'handgun'	965	49997	bojhpr	enheuyx

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	when i was born my real mother had me put on life insurance as a way to take care. of me or make sure i was good at first then the gears in her head started to turn and after i had hit my 18 month mark she had shook me so bad i had a swollen brain, bleeding eyes and i would be in an immense amount of pain. it was called sbs or (shaken baby syndrome.) she took me to see my dad who was in prison at the time and he had noticed the abnormally swollen head i had and asked my real mother if she knows anything about it she denied it completely cause she knew she was the one that did it to me, after she had left with me my dad told a guard that theres something wrong with me and to call the police, i was sent to the icu unit for children and when i went to go see a pediatrician the doctor had called cps on her and i wouldve been put into foster care but my aunt who i recognize as my mom fought for me and she got custody, after that my real mother was sent to prison for who knows how long (i cant remember.) and shes been in and out. to also recall she tried beating me when i was three years old after the first time she was out of jail and she was sent back after that, the board had a nail in it. she is a crack head now whose only goal is to try to reenter my life and use me and this wasnt the only time she tried doing it, the first time i was 16 and she promised me a car (lie) then said she loves me (lie #2) and that it was my dads fault etc etc etc (lie #3) i met her again at a little ceasars and she was acting like she missed me denied that she ever mentioned her telling me id get a car and then after i had gotten my first job she tried to say hey how are you and i just shuttled looked at her like every once of emotion was drained from my body and told her to fuck off. (i dont if this counts but i felt like it did.) edit: she tried killing me for the 500k that went with it incase i had any altercations. edit: i have no context with her each time i ever see her in public (which is rare.) i immediately begin to freak out or get the shakes and i promise you id would have a full panic attack or something of that nature. thats why im cautious around people while im in public in fear of bumping into her again and start to flip out.	1099	49997	bojhpr	eni2khe

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"about 10 years ago i used to share a 3 bedroom apartment with a friend, so we had a spare room. at some point he told me he had met some nice guy, who was older and a philosophy book translator, and he was looking for a place. i thought the extra money would be nice so i was ok with it. so the guy moves in, he's very reclusive so we don't talk much, but i start to get a weird vibe from him. one day i had to go to work meeting about 3 hours earlier than normal, so i woke up, dressed and left. he and my other friend had already left, so the apartment was left unattended. the meeting was over sooner than i anticipated, so i decided i would have lunch at home. when i arrive at the building, there's a fire truck in the streets, and the doorman runs towards me as soon as he sees me, telling that there was a gas leak in my apartment and they had to cut the gas to the whole building, and they were about to break into the apartment to check. when i enter the apartment i immediately smell the gas, and when i go check the kitchen i see all the stove's valves open. i called my friend and told him what happened, he called the other guy and he didn't answer. i went to check his bedroom and it was empty. the guy just left with all his stuff and tried to asphyxiate me while i slept. i didn't pursue it, and we never heard of the guy again. **edit: ok, i know i should have pursued it. it was over 10 years ago, i was young and this whole thing was very scary. i lost my sleep for weeks after this, and i still check the stove even 10 years later. the thing is, where i live, the police usually won't pursue ""attempted"" anything unless you have a shitload of money, which i don't. and at the time me and my friend decided to let it go because we would have no way to prove he actually did it, and it wasn't one of us who forgot the stove's valves open (the first thing i did when i saw them open was to close them all). i know i fucked up. things would be very different if they happened today.**"	1130	49997	bojhpr	eni1ppn

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i was 16 and staying in my older brother's house. in the house was my older brother and his wife, their two children and my sister's daughter, i was sleeping on the sofa as my brother and i had been playing gran turismo on the playstation late. anyway, the weekend before my brother had a bit of a get together with friends and family and someone tried to gatecrash it, the guy started a fight, got beat, and then left. the following thursday was the day i was staying and at 5am i find myself awake in the bathroom with blood squirting from my head and the bath had loads of blood in it, next thing i know is i'm back downstairs in the living room looking in the mirror, blood still gushing from my head, and all over the furniture, walls, kids toys, everything really. the guy who tried gatecrashing the party the previous weekend had brought a friend and kicked the front door open, his friend went upstairs to the master bedroom to attack my brother, while the main guy got me while sleeping, he started hitting me on the head with a claw hammer, with the claw part, after a while i remembered that i woke up and had automatically kicked out at him and hit him clean on the nose breaking his nose. he said that's the last thing your gonna do you wee bastard. the next thing i knew i was in the bathroom etc. police were called and they were found, just after dropping their weapons and scarves which they used to cover their faces. they only got 5 years each for attempted murder. not long after getting out of jail, one of them commited suicide, sadly it wasn't the one who tried to kill me	114	49997	bojhpr	enimz71
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was 15 my schoolfellow, whose brother i was friendly with, asked me to follow him outside to a lightly wooded area behind our school where kids used to go smoke. everything seemed totally normal- we were making casual small conversation- and once we got to the spot i said ""hold on, i have to take a piss"". turned my back on him to do the deed and next thing i felt was a super hard punch to my upper right back. turns out this ""punch"" was actually a stab- specifically, a stab with an 8"" knife. he was kind enough to a) inform me i'd been stabbed and b) remove the knife. survival instinct kicked in and i fell to the ground pretending to be dead, because he would of kept going otherwise. once i fell to the ground he took my watch off my hand, which we soon learned (according to him) was the impetus for the stabbing- he planned to pawn it (a $200 fossil watch my mom bought my on vacation to italy a couple years earlier) and buy some coke. once he ran off and i started getting up i noticed something was very wrong. i couldn't breath. my friends happened to be behind the school when i emerged from the wooded area yelling for them to go get help as i'd just been stabbed. they thought i was joking around as i usually did, but one of them finally came over after i fell to my knees and saw i was being for real, blood going everywhere. they'd fetched a teacher who proved to be the human embodiment of incompetence- she got the bright idea to have me lay on my stomach, which could of expedited the process of flooding my lungs with blood, but thankfully didn't as i only stayed in that position for a few seconds. the pain began to intensify as i was constantly gasping for air, but also some nerve damage had been done and my movement was greatly constricted. they propped me up against the lockers by the back entrance, where my blood coated the wall, and it took about 25 min for the ambulance to arrive. i was still in a great deal of pain even with the oxygen mask on, but it was nothing compared to the pain i'd experience shortly after in the er/or where they made a 5-6"" incision under my armpit in order to get at my lung so that they could insert a chest tube. the feeling of having the doctors hands inside of me, feeling around and holding my lung while i was still awake (under local anaesthetic) is the most bizarre thing i've ever encountered and a sensation i will never forget. i still don't know why they couldn't have put me under fully for such a procedure instead of administering local all around my body. at this point my parents had been brought in and were in hysterics after seeing me on the or table with blood everywhere. my mom was at home when the principal called to notify her what'd happened and ordered a cop to drive her to the hospital, a trauma centre about 30 min away from our home. my dad was at work on a construction site and went into a rage, getting together a band of his friends/workers to come to the hospital to find out who did this- they wanted to go kill the guy, but my mom managed to talk some sense into him. i was the most innocent 15 year old kid, never into drugs, alcohol, gangs, etc. and struggled for a long time with the question of ""why me?"" when there were so many much worse people out there than me. not that anyone deserves this kind of punishment. was a $200 watch worth it? i spent a couple weeks in the hospitals trauma unit and then a further month or two at home recovering. whoever stitched me up did a horrible job as they kept coming undone and i had to visit the er several times to have that fixed. bleeding out in public was not fun. psychologically it honestly didn't do too much damage as i think i was just too young to grasp the full weight of what'd happened. but physically it left the entire area around my upper right back and right arm/armpit completely numb for the rest of my life. i was also told that the lung could randomly collapse at any time-- apparently that's a possibility for those having suffered a traumatic pneumothorax, can anyone confirm?--, but it's been almost 15 years since the incident and i haven't had any major issues with the lung thus far. the guy who did it was 17 and protected by the young offenders act here in canada, which means he did zero jail time for this. i think he just got some community service hours. blows my fucking mind- what a dysfunctional system."	1812	49997	bojhpr	enhq28w
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"any of those stupid robbots on youtube, i don't give any of you permission to use this in your video. like a decade+ or so when i was a kid my family and i took a trip to tanzania for safaris. well, one night near the kenyan border we were out spotlighting for bush babies when a pair of headlights appear in the distance and blocks our car. a bunch of dudes with aks hop out of their truck and our tour guide drops his head to the wheel and keeps his hands on it. me, being what like 10 whined ""what's happening"" and my parents basically quietly and sternly told me to shut the fuck up and stay down. any time the guys with guns ask our tour guide questions he would just mumble responses and not look up. apparently my mom watched the dudes rubbing their crotches and staring at her and my sister (who is just a year older than me). after probably like 10 minutes (but it was so long ago and i was so young i don't really know) the dudes put their guns down, hop in their vehicle, and drive away. while pressing our tour guide for questions we would only get response like ""oh they were just game wardens looking for poachers"" and other bullshit. turns out it was (according to my parents after snooping around) a kenyan militia who goes around and kidnaps tourist groups to hold for ransom. they stop one group, call up the owner of the park/ preserve, and say basically they'll let this group go if he agrees to pay the ransom but if he doesn't they'll kill them and ruin his business if they don't get x amount of money. if the game warden agrees to their ransom then they let the first group go. if he doesn't then they kill and/or rape them. and then try again with the next group. if he doesn't pay the ransom by then, well you get the picture. awfully, although this was one of the more urgent near death experiences our family has had, we still laugh about it since something terrible like this happens on nearly every trip we go on with the family. israel and egypt, nearly had bombs go off on us. south africa, got stuck in a river with a very territorial hippo and jeep stuck on a termite mound with a very pissed leopard stalking us. also in tanzania i stuck my face in a boomslang and didn't notice. india something else happened but i don't remember what, i'll add it if i remember. it's a running gag with our family at this point, and we just assume any family trip we take something awful will go wrong. so much weird random shit happens to our family that our friends ask ""what happened this time?"" after a trip. edit i remembered another story from south africa, while we were out on safari a thunderstorm had rolled in, so we headed back to the camps. a bolt of lightning had struck the building directly next to ours (like 15 feet away) and burned it to the ground. the lady who was staying there, another tourist, handled it super well. she was just excited to have a cool story to tell! sadly she lost her luggage and passports in the fire but i'm sure it ended up okay. she didn't seem too troubled."	1768	49997	bojhpr	enhdcix
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i have posted this elsewhere. but ill give a short version. when i was 3 my father threw me into a 6ft deep pool and laughed as a drown. i did die and i still remember it. i was dead about 90 seconds, thankfully my mum found me, got me out and got me going again. so technically i was murdered, and then reset. still fear water on my face. that shit doesnt leave you. edit- some people have asked for a more detailed account of my life. that will be commented from this. i am on a phone, so forgive the spelling. so first up let.me say if you get upset over bad things. dont read on. so i had 2 parentd who were both damaged in there own way, my mum emotionally, my father mentally. he was a fkn nutjob in the way if anyone met him, they like him. shame about the real person people didnt see. so an heavily abreviated version of my life on no particular order would be as follows. laying on bed most nights listening to them fight, things getting broken, and him hitting or beating her. i fell asleep to her screams more times than i can begin to imagine. when i was 3 i drown as stated above. why did he do that? i dont remember, i think it had to do with me breaking a model boat he built. when i was 4 i walked in on hin strangling her, he almost succeeded, but my mum had alot of fight in her. she was 4""11, he is 6""3. so. i think you can see the advantage he had. he started on me when i was 4, im not sure when the 1st real beating was, i remember breaking his record player, i accidently dropped the arm, and the neddle broke, i got a belt, slapped, punched for that. few months later mum had a hysterectomy, hip to hip cut, was way back in the day, 1988 i belive. 3 weeks later he wanted his husband rights. i woke to the screams and tears, another night, but is was different. he raped her in the loungue, id call it a fucking blood bath but that just doesnt emphasize the level of brutality of watching your father rape your mum while he strangles her and punches her. i dont know how long i stood there. felt like forver. he started interfeering with me a little after that. dont ask. use your imagination. but whatever you csn fathom, your correct. thay was my life till i was 9, beatings, rape, torture, burns, and neglect. scratched his boke when i was 9, got beaten black and blue for that, still have the scars on my back. he pulled 15% of my hair out on boxing day, i didnt want to sleep in a car. so i got punished. we left a few days later. so the proceesjng years were death threats, stalking, cops, lawyers, put into hiding by major crime, councellers and more. i got into weed to cope, and tried suicide more than once. became an alcoholic more than once. hit my share of doors, self harmed. life got better. mum had a fall and slipped into a coma xmas day in the early 2000's. i was 18. shr lost 11.5 years. memory when she woke 3.5 days later. she said i was 7. my sister 5. oh and ni the father never touched her. i stood betwern them i took it for her. so i out my life on hold till i was 21 to help my mum return to herself. thats the short version leaving out alot."	1260	49997	bojhpr	enhz0q3

"when i was around 12, i had a friend who shared a room with a disabled younger brother. they had a super nintendo in their room, but because of how the furniture was arranged, the only place you could sit where you could see the tv well and play was on the younger brother's bed. we'd sit there and play all the time, and the little brother would frequently be there with us. no big deal. one day, my friend's mom wasn't home so it was just the three of us in the house. we were in our usual snes spot, sitting on the edge of the younger brother's bed. the little brother walked in and just lost his mind, screaming and crying because we were sitting on his bed (which, again, he'd been fine with every other time i'd been over). after a little bit, he ran out of the room for a couple minutes and got quiet. suddenly, he ran back through the door, slashing at the air with a big chef's knife from the kitchen, screaming ""get off my thomas."" my friend grabbed a long piece of sporting equipment and shoved him out the door with it. i slammed it closed. the bedroom door had no lock, so we spent the next hour taking turns bracing the door with our feet while his little brother wailed and stabbed at the door from the other side. eventually, he tired himself out and went to watch tv in the living room, but we kept that door barred until their mother got home. turns out that just that morning, their mom had put a brand new thomas the tank engine comforter on the little brother's bed and he was furious that we were sitting on it. i dunno what happened with the brother after that, because after she saw the damage to the door, she immediately drove me home and asked me not to tell my parents. i still hung out with my friend, but only at my house and far away from the younger brother."	359	49997	bojhpr	enhxc8j

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"there is this bar that my friends and i will go to sometimes. hole in the wall place in the country in some back roads. the kind of bar where interesting things sometimes go down. it's not unusual to have a quiet night playing some pool and sipping beer while some dude strums a guitar in the corner. it's also not unusual for a fight to break out or some kind of screaming match. my buddies and i love it for that reason. the drink is cheap and you never know what the night will turn into there. one time i even discovered a couple of folk.uh.*""eloping""* in a porta potty. but that's not how i was almost murdered. anyway, i had just finished having a couple of drinks with some old high school friends and had paid my tab and walked outside to the truck. one of my buddies was in the truck passed out sleeping (didn't know when to quit i guess) and my other buddy was inside paying his tab. so i am left out there by the truck with the passed out buddies girlfriend at the time. we were just standing there talking about whatever when all of a sudden the bar door swings open and this fat little young guy, all of 5 foot tall comes bursting out yelling and pointing at me. he had like 3 girls chasing him down trying to calm him down or whatever. he starts moving at me like an angry rhino doing the douchebag strut saying ""hey motherfucker! hey! you think it's okay for you to disrespect a woman like that!?"" i am completely in the dark as to what the heck he is talking about whatsoever so i say something like ""uh.i have no idea what you are talking about whatsoever."" he proceeds to get real close to me like he is gonna fight me and still yelling about disrespecting some female or something. i basically stand my ground and tell him to btfo because i don't know what he is talking about. i guess seeing that i was willing to defend myself via fisticuffs made the ruffian back off. he said something like ""yeah okay, bitch. okay!"" and started walking to his car. this made all the girls in his little possie start *really* trying to calm him down. i knew exactly what was happening. he was going for a gun. i was right. he reached in his car, pulled out a silver 1911 and racked the slide. now, usually in this scenario, i would have drawn my gun and shot the guy. but i was at a bar and i was a good boy who didn't have my gun at a bar because laws. he was probably 20 feet away so i didn't know if it was really loaded or not. the whole racking the slide thing probably tells me that it was not. but either way, gun.bad guy.not good. so i did something dumb. i put my hand behind my back like i was gonna draw and pointed at him with the other hand and said ""if you point that gun at me, i will kill you. right now."" my buddies girlfriend knew what was up and said ""he's a veteran and he is armed!"" dude, just stared at me for a sec, and put the gun back in the car while all his little chicks swarmed him. he goes back inside the bar. finally the other buddy comes out and i'm like ""wtf have you been!?"" funny thing is angry rhino-bro came back out a couple of minutes later and hugged me saying ""oh sorry dude. thought you were someone else."" okay, dickhead."	100	49997	bojhpr	enikjmx
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	not certain if it was a murder attempt or a kidnapping attempt. so i had just spent a few hours with my girlfriend in the town centre and had just dropped her back at home. this is england in the winter so it was dark fast. i had walked the majority of the way home through what isnt the best area of my town,when i realised two guys had been following me for a good portion of my walk. the thing is they were clearly following me too, every time i turned, they would too. i even started making loops to make sure. now im around six foot one inch and am mainly muscle due to a background in rugby and martial arts. so im not exactly the best target to take on when it comes to something like this. anyways i ended up just pulling a 180 spin and walking directly towards both men ( yeah i know that was dumb but it seemed the best choice, i dont know why) and this seemed to freak them out so they just let me past. although they didnt stop following me till i got back onto the main street too.	620	49997	bojhpr	enhpi6f

""nope"". then he asked if i smoked weed. i told him ""yup"" so he asked i wanted to share a joint. ""nope"". then he told me he'd sprinkle some coke on it if i wanted. ""nope"". the whole time he hasn't crossed the street. he's just woofing at me. but he's looking around all over the place. seems to be checking to see if there are any other people out. my spidey senses started to tingle at that point. i was only a few blocks from my house so i figured i'd just keep walking and head in. that's when he asked if i wanted to see his gun. ""no thanks"". instead of going home i turned in to a gangway between two houses and realized that an acquaintance of mine lived in one of the houses so i started pounding on her door. after a few seconds i peeked out to the street and didn't see the guy so i wandered out to the front yard, looked around and he was gone. disappeared. maybe. 3 weeks later i saw in the newspaper that the police had arrested a guy who was a suspect in several sexual assaults, rapes and murders in the general area over a period of years. it was that dude. if something feels out of the ordinary or uncomfortable. trust your instinct."""	59	49997	bojhpr	enij83o

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	this isnt my story, but it is my dads. back in 1979 my dad was a orphaned high schooler living with his evil, nasty aunt who he was left in custody to several years earlier due to my grandmother passing. his cousin from ireland, brian, had come to live with them as well at some point in 79. brian was just as evil and nasty and with a terrible drinking problem. but everyone in the family loveeedddd brian and thought he was the victim all the time. no matter what brian did, he was the angel and my dad was the harasser and the bully. brian registry stole money from my dad, planted drugs on him in an attempt to get him arrested two months before my dad left for the marine corp and ultimately tried to have my dad murdered. my dad was walking home after his late night shift at mcdonalds when a car came careening at him off the road onto the sidewalk. my dad jumped into a bush and narrowly avoided the car. my dad gets up and sees that its a friend of brians who is a local drunk. i cant remember his name but we will call him john. john revs the car in reverse and forward again in an attempt to hit my dad again. he misses again and starts chasing my dad up the street with the car going up and off the sidewalks trying to nick my dad. this went on for about two minutes until finally john crashed the car into a telephone pole. john gets out of the car and drunkenly starts to chase my dad and tell him hes gonna fucking kill him. my dad was luckily in better shape because he was preparing to go into the marines. he was able to outrun john and took refuge at a local convenience store. my dad never called the cops or pressed charges because he was leaving in two months and because his previous run in with the cops when john planted the drugs on him left a bad taste in his mouth with the local law enforcement. he never also told much of the family anyways since they all sided with brian as it was for everything. this left my dad and his family at odds for many years and he didnt speak to much of his immediate family for nearly a decade or so afterwards when some fences were mended. the day brian died from cirrhosis in 06 and my dad found out he told his aunt that he hoped brian was rotting in hell. i tried to condense the story as best as i could. if anyone has any questions just feel free to act tl;dr my dads alcoholic cousin tried to have him murdered literally for no reason.	54	49997	bojhpr	enijm3i
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"in 2017, i was at a trolley station in national city, ca, buying a ticket when some big dude about 250 pounds and 6' 1 walked up and sucker punched me in the side of the head (i'm 5'11"", 165 lbs). i went down hard, hitting my head on the concrete. then he grabbed my legs and tried to push me onto the tracks. there was nobody on this side of the tracks (southbound), but tons of people on the other side, which is also a waiting area for buses. i shouted like hell for help while kicking at him and suddenly, after about 45 seconds, he backed off and apologized, saying something about having had a bad day with his wife. he backed off, i jumped up and picked up my stuff (phone and wallet, which i had had out while buying a ticket), and yelled at him to get the fuck out of there. then he just walked away slowly. i called the cops and gave them a very good description, actually following behind the guy for a while as he plodded away. they showed up and detained the wrong guy at first. then my attacker just walked up to the cops and confessed. he explained to them that he thought i was the one who had been sleeping with his wife. apparently a case of mistaken identity, but my head still hurt six hours later, so i went to the hospital to get checked out (moderate concussion). as i had been falling to the ground, i clearly saw a security camera pointed right at me. the district attorney got footage and told me i had been hit pretty hard. the guy ended up getting convicted of felony assault and got 10 months in jail. he was also wanted by san diego pd, so i don't know what other trouble he had gotten into. i can tell you that i saw his wife in court, and there was no way i was sleeping with her. the aftermath of this is: 1) i was really fucked in the head for a few weeks after this trying to figure out why it happened to me. my wife died of cancer at just 44 in 2011, so i was starting to wonder what cosmic force had decided to fuck with me. in the end i decided that would mean believing in ""god,"" so i gave up on that theory. 2) i often joke that i am owed a session with somebody's wife to make up for being attacked for.sleeping with somebody's wife when i actually hadn't. edit: it was broad daylight when this happened."	295	49997	bojhpr	eni55vq
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	many years ago i was driving through utah. at that time one could drive for many miles on the freeway and not see another car. i hadn't seen anyone else for at least fifteen minutes other than the semi truck in front of me. i pulled out to pass and he sped up a bit, with the result that i am committed to the pass just as we cross a bridge with guard rails. he immediately moves into my lane. i'm going to die because i have nowhere to go. i floor the gas and somehow pull ahead. looking back in the rearview mirror he is completely in my lane. there is no way he didn't know i was there. it took me a while to realize that he tried to kill me on purpose. it's possible no one would have known and just put my death down as an accident.	143	49997	bojhpr	enihbn2
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i don't know if this qualifies as a murder attempt but i can say for certain it was a robbery attempt. it happened in chicago during daylight when i was moving some items around for a large photo shoot. stupid me forgot my box cutter so i had a small switchblade with me to open the boxes up. &#x200b; i am walking down the street and this guy who is pretty much my age comes out of nowhere and starts trying to talk to me about some nonsense. i did notice he had his hand clenched as if he was holding something. i tell him i am busy and not interested at which point he puts his arm around my back and and says how about i give what i have on me. &#x200b; by this point i had one of my hands in my pockets with the switchblade open, once he said that i ended up stabbing him twice. the police came out with the ambulance, they put handcuffs on me but ended up releasing when another cop recognized the guy who got stabbed as a known criminal and they just believed my story of self defense and let me go.	99	49997	bojhpr	eni2omn
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	my brother tried to kill me. he was in the kitchen and i was in the room attached to it on the computer. he was talking loudly and asked a question, i told him i had no idea and he snapped. yelled that he was talking to himself not me and to shut up etc. he grabbed a pair of big scissors, opened them up and said he was going to slit my throat and came at me. i managed to run faster and lock myself in another room. when he was trying to break through it (managed to get a big crack down the door) my parents came home. i was 14, he was 22 or 23. my mom told me if it ever happened again he would get kicked out. so it got completely ignored. when it did happen a second time, all 4 of us kids were playing a game and i was joking around with my sister. he told me to shut up grabbed a decorative sword off his bedroom wall and swung it at me. i moved fast enough it hit my chair and i bolted. i went upstairs and told my parents, my mom stormed off and said 'thanks for ruining christmas'. apparently i shouldn't care that it happened, i should 'get over it'. caused issues between me and my parents, my mom especially. years later i was told, what do you expect he's family. sometimes you let things go to hold the family together. i told her that makes sense for small things, but big things like this just show the kid that they don't matter. how could i ever think i mattered to them when they didn't care or help when someone tried to end my life. ignoring it showed how little i mattered and my whole family made me think i was fucked for not seeing how i should drop it. still have to be around him at times unfortunately.or at least i did until recently. i don't talk to my family any more, shockingly not for that specific reason. since it happened when i was so young, and the way it was handled, i felt like i didn't matter for years. it messed me up big time.	94	49997	bojhpr	enihn75
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	it wasn't a full on premeditated attempt, or as dramatic as some other stories here, but i was pretty deeply affected by mine. during a suicide attempt 2 years ago, my last so pointed the shotgun at me for a much longer moment than i was comfortable with, and made threatening noises. i just bolted and was outside with multiple walls and corners between us before he could even finish his barely coherent sentence. i was already on the phone with 911, so i just stayed outside in the dark until they arrived. had he come for me, i trusted in my ability to hide, or at least be far enough out of the lethal range of a shotgun to survive, even if he hit me. i have a decent amount of lingering issues from that night i'm still working through in therapy, some related to guns, some related to cops (they searched my home afterwards, made fun of my decor, basically the next several hours sucked and i would love to forget that entire evening ever happened), some related to dating and trusting people in general. pretty normal, i presume.	45	49997	bojhpr	eni36ld
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"i was working at a local grocery store as an assistant customer service associate- i would work early mornings and late nights closing and opening the store. one night i was closing the store and it was about an hour to an hour and a half before closing time- around this time i typically send one of my cashiers to go get carts while i collect registers but this night we were busy and i was stuck on a register so my manager went out to get carts to help me while i was on a register. when he was out there he asked me on my head set if my boyfriend would have left me roses on my car. in response to that, i told him no, because the guy i was dating at the time was at home and didn't have a car. he told me ""huh, that's weird, you have a stuffed animal rose in your car door handle and it has a weird smiley face written on the tag. it must be one of your stalkers"" he said jokingly. but i was wondering who could have left me that- so when it slowed down my manager and i watched footage on the security cameras and we see a car back into the space next to mine- roll down its window- and stick the plush rose into my door handle and speed off. i didn't recognize the car so my manager told me he would walk me to my car when we left. he walked me to my car and i started driving down the road- i got a call from him about one minute later where he sounded frantic saying that the guy who stuck the rose in my handle was waiting in a parking lot across the street and went through our grocery parking lot going about 85 trying to catch up to me and that i was most likely being followed. which is also when my phone died, and i didn't have a charger in my car. i live in a rural country area and hardly ever is anyone behind me by the time i get to my roads to get to my house- i looked behind me and sure enough someone was following me at a strange distance- so, i knew there was an abandoned gas station a little ways down the street so i told myself i'd do a u turn around it and see if the person followed and see if it was the same car. i went around the abandoned pumps and what do you know- it is the same car and he follows me around the pumps too. at this point i want to cry and i'm in a panic. there aren't any police stations near by, my phone is cut off. so, i go about 125 down a windy back road until i can't see him behind me anymore, pull off into some random road, pull into a stranger's house and cut my lights off and wait there for about an hour. i called the cops when i got home and none of them took me seriously and said they wouldn't have been able to do anything about the situation because the person hadn't touched me. a couple weeks pass, and i am out and about to get something for my friend from work's baby shower- i'm at baby's r us and i ran inside and left my window a crack down in my jeep because i knew i'd only be inside for a minute. before i went in i looked at my id and thought that i might want to grab it because i was going to be using a credit card and they might want to see it but i thought to myself ""nahhh if they need it i'll come back out"". turns out, they did need it, so i went out to my car and. my license is gone. and i am very confused. i am an air head and tend to mis place things but i knew i had seen it before i had gotten out of the car- i thought i had gone mad. i brushed it off and just used my debit card instead and honestly kind of forgot about my id and ordered a new one thinking the old one would turn up. fast forward about two days- i had two cops show up at my door. when i answered they asked me if i was ""first middle last name"" and i said ""yes"" and they said ""thank god, we thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere"". at that point i was very confused and they told me that they had arrested a man in ""so and so"" county under some pretty extreme charges and that he had my license and a bunch of photos of me and random stuff of mine on him and in his car during the arrest. i swear i lost all color in my face. they gave me their numbers and said my stuff would be coming in the mail with a deportation officer's number and to give them a call if anything new happens or if i have any questions. i don't know what that guys intentions were, what he would have done if he had followed me home that night and i hadn't noticed, or how long he had been watching me for or following me- but i am so thankful that nothing happened. it wasn't for another month or so of digging that i found out who it had been who had followed me. it was some guy in his late 20's that came into my store often- he'd only ever buy coronas and newport cigarettes and he barely spoke english- he always gave me the heebie jeebies. he had actually come into the store earlier that night- i just didn't know he drove that car. i think about this night/month all the time."	51	49997	bojhpr	eni9yy7
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	when i was 20 my good friend (18m) and i were stabbed unprovoked (our perspective). he died within the hour and i walked away with minor stab wounds. we had gone to a small party, 10-15 people, in an apartment during a cold -40 winter day. there were 4 of us. we only knew a couple people there but we got along well with everyone there (so we thought). this party was just a pre-drink before a social which most of us were going to walk to. once we showed up we started selecting music that was playing on a laptop with speakers, so we sort of took over the dj position. nobody was actively djing and nobody objected. turns out one of the girls there didn't like the music we were picking, and she had a male friend with her who was a part of a gang. her and her male friend left the party 30 mins prior to drive to the social. once we left we started walking and we heard a honk behind us. turn around and it's the girl and guy who left 30 mins before. now because it's -40 and we seemed to get along well with them, we assume they are going to offer us a ride. so the 4 of us turn around and 2 of us start to jog over, the other 2 walk. once we were close enough, without a single word uttered, the male grabs my friend by the shoulder and swiftly stabs him multiple times and before i could react he turns to me and stabs me as well. after the trial 3 years later i finally learned the cause of this action. the female told him that we were a part of a rival gang and we needed to be dealt with. all because she didn't like our music. rip josh i'll always love you man and i'll never forget. never.	47	49997	bojhpr	enj9utk

"i was 17 and the yearbook photographer/editor. a guy i knew who was a freshman came in for a print. to print things, you had to go to printer rooms and have a teacher or verified student do the print job. so he comes in with a jump drive. i pop it in and print it for him, don't even bother checking it, because that's what friends do. help each other print their banned materials, right? well, i pull it out of the printer and he asks me to proofread it. i do, and it's a suicide note. while i'm reading it, he walks up behind me and starts to choke me. i mentioned this in another thread just today, but stupid tv tropes saved my life that day. he choked me until i passed out, then left me there with the note. i woke up and stumbled out of the print room and made it to the room of one of my teachers. he called for help and took me to the office. my father ""opted to not press charges"" and the kid was sent to live with his dad in california to ""work on his mental health."" someone pointed out years later that he tried to make it look like i killed myself, by having me hold the note and print it myself l. i still panic if someone touches my neck and it's been almost ten years. i ran into him years later and it was horrific. i'm living across the country now and still dread seeing him."	48	49997	bojhpr	enjdg4n

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"when i was about 11 years old, my step father tried to poison me using tuna helper. i don't know what he put in it but i was sick for days. he would watch me and get angrier and angrier as i got better. during the first few days he would smile from ear to ear every time i vomited or passed out. i know it was just mine because i wasn't allergic to any food, and i was the only one who got sick. he and my mother ate the same thing. this was the one time i know he tried to out right kill me. other times it was just playing, he wanted me to hurt. this time he wanted to really get rid of me. ever since then, i can't handle cold pasta or tuna helper of any kind. my body automatically rejects it if i even try to eat it. i didn't realize what happened until years later, when i talked to the man who i call my father (the step dad after) about when his ex wife tried to murder him. she used arsenic, and he now rejects anything almond or hazelnut automatically, his body acts as if it is trying to be poisoned again. i knew then from my own reaction that he tried to kill me. i knew he hated me. the seven years my mom was with him he abused me in pretty much every way. raped me at 9, prostituted me to his friends at 11. when my mom found out just part of what he had done, he said ""she is the spawn of satan, and it is god's will that i punish her"". this was not a metaphor to him. i am so glad that he was enough of an idiot to not know how much of whatever it was to actually kill me. my worst fear is that he will show up again someday to finish the job. he was never arrested, or anything, because i was terrified to say anything. i was a coward. he is out there somewhere. i have a vague knowledge of where. i just hope he has forgotten about me, but i fear for any other children that are unknowingly put in his hands."	152	49997	bojhpr	eni17v2
(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	"three really drunk guys tried to jump me and a few of my friends while we were out really late at night. the most aggressive guy kinda singled me out (i think because i was the only dude in our group) and started coming at me from across the street with his fists up. there were two other guys behind him and i couldn't tell if they were going to try to fight me as well. the dude in front was shouting like ""i'm gonna fucking kill you, i'm gonna beat the shit out of you,"" punching every sentence with a choice racial slur. i tried to let him know i didn't want any trouble but he kept coming at me. the dude got within maybe fifteen feet of me and i really freaked out, sorta had a fight-or-flight response. this whole time i'd been holding my pocketknife sorta behind my back- i didn't want to escalate things if i could avoid it. when he got close and i realized he wasn't going to stop i whipped the night out in front of me and just screamed, ""get the fuck back or i'll slit your fucking throat!"" he stopped dead in his tracks and his friends were all ""oh shit he's got a knife! he's just drunk man, we're sorry!"" i calmed down a little bit and told them not to follow us, and we hightailed it outta there. super scary even though it thankfully never got physical. i was seventeen at the time, maybe 125 pounds soaking wet, and i knew the dude would have wrecked me if we actually fought. made me really anxious for a week or so afterwards."	44	49997	bojhpr	enikhca

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	i used to live on the outskirts of downtown and would go visit a friend that lived downtown. he lived in a place that's kind of like a halfway house so he wasn't allowed to have overnight guests so i'd leave his place at around 10pm and catch the bus back home. the streetlights at the nearest bus stop were all out and that made me uncomfortable so i decided to walk to the next stop which ended up being an awful decision. there was an old guy under the influence sitting at this bus stop and he tried to hit on me. i ignored him and then he called me a bunch of names and started acting violent. i turned around to walk away and he reached over to grab me by my hair. he starts punching me, we fall to the ground and then he starts slamming my head into the concrete repeatedly. i was so focused on trying to fight back i never screamed or anything. a minute later a group of men end up pulling this guy off of me, restrain him and call the police. if those guys had not been in the area i probably would've died because the old guy was not slowing down. i was too traumatized to show up to court when he was charged so he ended up only serving 3 months.	643	49997	bojhpr	enhk6ak

(serious) people who have survived a murder attempt (by dumb luck) whats your story?	im reluctant to tell this story because im not sure how popular it will be, but my comments never get upvoted so here goes. in the summer after i graduated high school i decided to finally realize a dream id had growing up in a small town. i worked the whole year to save enough money to live for a couple of months in a city i loved before college. i left with an air mattress, a laptop, a suitcase of clothes, and a few essentials and moved into a shared house. i quickly made friends with my housemates and found that everyone i met had an amazing story and somehow we all ended up there at that moment, i decided i wanted to meet lots of new people and experience everything the city had to offer. i didnt have a car so i would have to use public transit, or walk, for my adventures. a month went by and everything was going better than i had ever dreamed, i was so happy! then one night i decided i wanted to go take pictures of a local spot id frequented in the time id been there. i made a friend who lived in the area and they told me i could come there for the night when i was done since public transport would likely be closed for the night. so i got my things together and made my way there. after i got the pictures i wanted i decided to sit on a bench and listen to a man singing opera on the street, it was utterly beautiful and i decided i needed to meet this person and learn his story too. we got to talking and several other people joined the conversation; two girls from europe and three men from the city. eventually we all parted ways and i decided it was time to contact my friend about coming over. only my friend never answered. i tried for about 30 minutes and waited in the same spot until the three men from earlier came back and asked if i had any plans for the rest of the night. i said i did but now im not sure, i might have to walk home. they offered to walk with me and handed me a bottle of rum they were drinking, said might as well have fun on the walk. thinking about how everyone i met to that point had been wonderful, and that i had a better chance at being safe walking with three men than alone, i obliged and took a drink. stupid. so stupid. after i was sufficiently liquored up they offered to get a taxi since i was having a hard time remembering the way home. they hailed one and i got in and thanked them, but they got in too. they then spoke to the driver in spanish and the driver started going somewhere i couldnt recognize. i asked where we were going and they told me, the jungle. at that point one of them was talking to the driver loudly while another started groping me. i did everything i could to stop him but i couldnt in my state. when we got to the jungle they all started groping. i fought back as hard as i could, i tried everything to get away. after i was effectively beaten to an utter pulp one pulled out a knife, another a gun. i stopped fighting back. they raped me for 6 hours before someone finally heard and investigated. i grabbed what i could of my things at that moment and made a run for it, getting to the closest populated area i could to wait for a taxi. when i went to the hospital a few hours later, after having passed out immediately upon arriving home, i realized just to what extent i was hurt. every. single. inch. of my body was bruised or cut and covered in blood. i filed a report and had a kit done, then they gave me a gallon bag of medications that would help me to not get an std. i was able to gather later, when talking to the police, that they were in a gang. my best guess is ms13 from the things they said and what they called each other. when the dna tested positive for two wanted individuals i asked them to confirm my suspicion, but they said they could only confirm they were in a gang and not which one specifically. because of that and the fact that they still had my camera and had access to my wallet and i. d. for so long i did not go through with the court case. i legally changed my name, moved, and tried to move on. its been many years since that night now, and ive been through therapy and am happy to say i no longer suffer from symptoms of ptsd, but i definitely know better than to expect the best from people i meet now. to the men who almost destroyed my life and beat me within an inch of death, lets not meet. ever.	287	49997	bojhpr	enifqhq

you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	somebody needs to make a book called the time traveler's guide. each chapter is a premise of you being stranded back in time in a different era. it would have information you need to change the world with available technology at the time. like say how to make gunpowder and a cannon if it was 1300's europe. maybe there's a book like that out there already, and if so, it's amazon time. and then in the case of this thread, have the digital copy before you get sent back and go to the 1800's chapter and write down what you can before the battery dies.	16579	50240	blrjnj	emrh7fb

you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	do i have a chance to prepare? if so, grab an offline copy of wikipedia with science and engineering topics. pretty much every phone designed can accept ~5v dc power from the usb port for slow charging. if it were 200 years in the past, we would have voltaic piles available in research labs, but no dynamo. since each copper/zinc cell has about .5 volts, stack a series of 10 of them together, with piles in parallel supplying power to the phone. now i can use the phone without having to worry about running out of power! it might be necessary to take the phone apart to connect the external power source to the phone, since i might not have a usb-c cable to cannibalize. at this point, exploit the futures knowledge of geography to buy valuable land for mining, and introduce electricity for industrial purposes about 50 years early.	5044	50240	blrjnj	emrexhz

you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	that would be 1819. lady ada lovelace (the inventor of the first working mechanical computer) started working on it in the 1830's. i would find her and charles babbage and explain all the advances in computers and softward and hardware (i.e transistor design) in general. i am an electrical engineer with 25 years experience in digital vlsi design and audio signal processing. after teaching them knowledge that wouldn't be known for 150 to 200 years, i would leave with them the working example of a computer more powerful than they could dream of, the smart phone. i would tell them to keep it safe, until technology develops that they can effectively reverse engineer it (though i already would have given them a high level overview of how it works , from the rf front end to the back end application processor). i would also give them a high level overview of the manufacturing process for such a device. i could teach them how to make a dc power supply to keep the iphone charged but i don't have the specs on the recharge connector protocol, so it is not as simple as making a dc power supply and then your done. my hope is that i advance technology by a hundred years. however the best that can hope for is a few decades because advancement in one technology requires advancement in other technologies, some of which i have no expertise in. this is like how the ancient greeks discovered the basic steam engine, but this didn't cause the industrial revolution to happen a 2000 years earlier because the metallurgy required to make vessels that could withstand the high pressures of a working practical steam engine would not be invented for hundreds of years. also if ada lovelace was hot, i would try to fuck her. edit: 1) my wanting to fuck her doesn't negate the truth of all the technical stuff said before. 2) to those saying she's 4 years old, i implied that while i would arrive in the world when she was 4, i wouldn't meet her until she started working on the computer, which would put her at ~20 yrs of age. 3) though i'm married , 1833 < 1999. so according to temporal boner logic, its not cheating. edit2: 4) yes some of you are right: she didn't technically invent the computer; her collaborator charles babbage did that. she programmed the machine though. so hardware: babbage , software: lovelace. 5) some of you state that i the charging protocol is not complicated and that my dc power supply would work. but i think others correctly point out that only applies to the old usb connectors. this won't work with the lightning connector on a modern iphone.	9106	50240	blrjnj	emqxmjj

you're transported 200 years into the past with a fully charged smart phone but no charger. what do you do?	"i arrive 200 hundred years in the past, if we go from direct location i am in the upper west side of manhattan in 1819. my office space is now a farm of a rich resident within the city. after talking to them for awhile, i will set out to find robert fulton. i am about to invest or work on his uss ontario, the first steamboat to travel between ny and ohio. i invest in that shit, rail roads, and mills (where they make cloths) and become a robber baron during the dawn of the industrial revolution (i give people reasonable time off, and breaks each day, so everybody loves me) . with my new cash, and the ability to predict the future, i use my money to go on a few year long vacation. i immediately head to illinois why may you ask. to kill indians, nope. i need to find a young abraham lincoln, who at this point is like 20 and just started becoming a local lawyer. i talk to him for hours pretending to be a client needing representation. we become friends, and then i head down to maryland. i begin to purchase large amounts of slaves, with the plan to move them out west and free them starting a black commune (possibly in california where we find gold, and an easy access to income in the sacramento valley about 2 decades before the gold rush) where they are able to have a job, receive education (most slaves couldnt read) and live in the relative freedom. i try to buy as many slaves as possible however, i am looking for a specific young african american. a polymath and possibly the smartest guy in american history not named benjamin franklin, fredrick douglas. i find him, he's about 10, i free him, and send him to oxford to school those assholes. then after all this, i start investing in oil, i hire a young rockefeller to run the books, then i get jp morgan to help manage my railroad empire. and last but not least, at 50 as the civil war begins to dawn, i tell my proteges abraham lincoln and fredrick douglas to handle the situation (i also tell abe to watch out for fords theater) and then i head off to the ottoman empire. the empire is failing and i am willing to make a huge investment if they give me saudi arabia. they are desperate and oil hasnt been discovered there yet so i get what i wish. i also ask them to create a country for the armenian people, they do. after that i create a democracy in the model of the us in saudi arabia. i reach out to the us, and we become allies, normalizing american and the muslim worlds around a hundred years before we actually do. then i head to the congo fuck the belgians, i am taking this bitch over. no hands or dicks will be cut off in the name of rubber. i still make a killing on rubber. bang im back in the us the civil war is over and abe is dead (he didnt watch out for fords theater). with a large black coalition i am elected to congress where i continue reconstruction for forty years after it ended in this reality. race relations are good in the us. after an incredibly successful and long congressional run where i speed up the suffrage movement (and tell the daughters of the confederacy to fuck themselves) . as a 90 year old man, i invest in electric cars (thomas edison, tesla, the lumiere brothers, the wright brothers, and percy lavon julian have worked for me there entire lives) as my final frontier. we reverse advertise electric cars, making oil cars seem girly and that antisemitic asshole henry ford never makes a dime because i developed the assembly line forty years before he was born. with billions of dollars i die happily surrounded by my family. i give everything to the commune, the congo, and saudi arabia and leave a small portion for my family and close friends. in a portion of my will there is very specific instructions. as the new (20th) century dawns a trusted family member opens a safe. in the safe there are instructions to operate a strange square device. it hasnt been turned on since i arrived to this time. my son turns the phone on, the instructions read ""the following underlined material is an address in austria, at this address lives a happy family. that family has a son, he is a baby and very cute. kill that fucking baby."" that baby is named adolf hitler. i win the game"	233	50240	blrjnj	emrnar9

what's the best job for a lazy person?	"i'm sure this will likely be lost in the other awesome jobs. but i once had a job that required maybe 10 minutes of work a day. essentially, it was my job to rent people mobility scooters. i'd sit in a small room surrounded by different coloured scooters and i'd just read or watch movies with my feet up because we had maybe 2-4 ""customers"" a day. if a person came in for a scooter, i'd ask for their name and post code, write it down on a piece of paper and give them the keys. when they came back i would, usually an hour or two later, i'd charge the scooter by just plugging it in. that's all. the entire job. the work really slowed when the local government started charging for the formally free service. then i'd maybe see 3 people a week. and they paid me 8 per hour."	102	39873	bo3owh	endbpjo

what's the best job for a lazy person?	it depends on what kind of lazy you are - work hard 1-2 decades and chill for the rest of your life lazy, or wake up at 11am and go to work at 2pm kind of lazy. someone in my family works as an anesthesiologist and another as a neurophysiologist. both work literally 10-15 hours a week for $150k-225k a year. they worked hard through their education and got lucky at parts, but the payoff is being lazy / retirement capable by age 40 if you're willing to retire to a cheaper country, or \~60 if you invest / save well and want to stay in the states. alternatively, some of my laziest friends (gamers, potheads) work remote as software engineers / web engineers. this work is task based and relatively independent (depending what company you work for), and if you seek out projects for startups / small growing companies you also get to try your luck at making it big with pieces of equity here and there.	311	39873	bo3owh	encxbfp
what's the best job for a lazy person?	working at a visitors center along a interstate. my buddy works at one along i-15 and he just sits in a chair and points things out on a map to people all day. he basically is on one long break. he steps out back whenever know one is around and tokes his e-pen. so basically he sits in an air conditioned little room and tells people where cools spots are and fun things to do on their trip. plus you get to meet all sorts of interesting and creepy people. all while being baked off his ass.	136	39873	bo3owh	enczqzs
what's the best job for a lazy person?	not sure if it qualifies but i used to oversee gas pressure on an outlet on an oil rig. id just sit there for 12h/day for up to 4 weeks at a time. nothing ever happened and if it did there wouldnt be much time to act accordingly. id just be the first to know that we would all die very soon.	135	39873	bo3owh	end9dni
what's the best job for a lazy person?	in college, i was the substitute proctor for a standardized test company. they would hold practice exams, and i would just say 'start', set an alarm, and say 'end' when it was done. that was basically it. didn't have to look for people cheating, because if you're paying $1000 to take a class and you cheat on the practice exam, then that's on you. easiest beer money in the world, and i got to do work or read during it.	68	39873	bo3owh	encxt7t
what's the best job for a lazy person?	one time i had a sweet gig as an overnight caregiver for a sweet old lady neighbor of my mom's friend. she lives alone, is around 90, super mentally and physically with it. she just gets scared at night and likes the company. i would go over at around 8pm, watch dancing with the stars or whatever with her, discuss current events, and would usually end up going to bed before her at around 11 (she didn't mind as long as i was in the house). i would wake up and have breakfast with her, then leave around 7 or 8 the next morning. she paid $100/night. i did this for a while when i was preparing for my nclex and for a bit after i passed. i had to leave because i got a job as a camp nurse, and then i ended up moving and getting a real job so i didn't try to get that job back. i hope she's still alive and that someone else is filling in as well as i did - they were some pretty big, lazy shoes to fill.	64	39873	bo3owh	enczq24

what's the best job for a lazy person?	i lucked out massively at uni, i responded to an ad to build an alumni website that had a few unique features. during the interview they asked how i would build a specific feature and i basically said, i'm not sure i'd have to do some research - apparently every other candidate had arrogantly said they could do it easily and it rubbed up the interviewers the wrong way - i literally got the job because i said i wasn't sure! it was amazing money for a broke student, an hourly contract rate wayyy higher than my previous bar & retail work. they were happy for me to work from home providing i sent them updates by way of various documents and prototypes. i basically clocked in shit ton of hours as i could just fire up my laptop when i had some free time and crack on. this went on for ages. unfortunately the (phd?) project managers found out they were not allowed to carry on with the project and the funding was pulled. i basically billed a shit ton of hours, got to hack some code whenever i had time and i never had to finish the product. it was easily the cushiest gig i've ever had, and absolute gold as a student. sadly bills had to be paid and i had to pick up some regular work (which was also awesome, but no way this good). tl;dr hired for a programming gig because i didn't know what i was doing. was allowed to work whenever i want from home, and ultimately the project was cancelled. got to learn some awesome stuff and got paid good money to do it!	83	39873	bo3owh	end18bs

what's the best job for a lazy person?	late to the party, but my job fits. it took about a month to memorize the details of the documents i look at and how to enter the data in our system. since then its been literally no work. open pdf. open data program. enter correct name and ssn. hit f7 until it says next. hit f9 until it says next. repeat. each document has about 300 questions and i could probably do one in 20 minutes with my eyes closed, besides entering a date or two. its such a do nothing job that ive gained 60 pounds in 4 years, and watched about 8\*5\*52\*4 hours of netflix/hulu/twitch. all while getting paid $50k a year. bonus: i am the top performer on my team. most completions, fewest mistakes. it is really a joke.	109	39873	bo3owh	encwuas

what's the best job for a lazy person?	lifeguard at a retirement complex. i did this every summer throughout high school and university, and never once did i have to intervene or do anything. my regular clientele consisted of four old ladies who would meet each morning to chat and sunbathe, and one very fit old dude who would swim laps at the end of the day. i suppose it would have been more work if any emergencies had actually happened though.	37	39873	bo3owh	end7j0r

what's the best job for a lazy person?	i worked as a personal shopper for a couple of years and it was the chillest and easiest job i have ever had. it was part of this app/website so i worked remotely from home basically just googling things for people and trying to find the best price. i actually found it through reddit in one of the job subreddits and it was a small startup company that had only been around for a few months. i honestly don't know how it lasted as long as it did because we didn't charge for our services and although we had partnerships with many companies and websites, sometimes we ordered through ebay and amazon since they would end up being the cheapest option. we also didn't have that huge of a customer base and most days were super slow. it was pretty nice for me, got paid $16/hour to basically just watch tv all day and wait to see if we had any requests, most of which wouldn't even take that long. they finally ended up closing last year, but it was an interesting run and if anything i am really good at finding deals for myself now when i want to buy something.	246	39873	bo3owh	enclmr1

what's the best job for a lazy person?	early in my career i was a county adult probation officer. i got assigned to a town of 3000 people. the local justice court wanted their own po assigned and the judge wanted me to live in the town. it was slow to say the least but my last year was almost work free. the average po has a caseload if 60-80 probationers. i had 2 and id see them once a month. with seeing them in office, a once a month home visit, documenting my efforts, and court, i worked maybe 5 hours per month. my boss said i could stay home if i wanted, but i had to have my cell on. for a year, i probably put in less than 60 hours of actual work.	62	39873	bo3owh	end07e9

what's the best job for a lazy person?	i was a security guard in a closed linkbelt factory in chicago. this building took up 11 city blocks. it was freaking huge! 12 hour shifts. this was in 1975 so no mobile phones, computers, and dvd players were the size of atms. there was only one room in this place that had heat. it was the power room for all the overhead cranes. the temperature, even in the summer was in the 40s you had to wear a jacket. in the winter it was colder than the outside freezing temperatures. the floor was oil soaked wooden blocks, which i shoveled up in a 55 gallon drum and set on fire for heat. but, on the plus side, the power was still on to the cranes that ran on a rail at the top of a 70 foot ceiling. i got pretty good at 55 gallon drum bowling, using the crane hook to swing into the barrels. i was a student and the pay was good. there was plenty of study time.	26	39873	bo3owh	endqizk

what's the best job for a lazy person?	you can grow up on a farm, and then join the navy because you think it's less work than farming. they'll want you to do a lot of work at the naval academy, however, which you can get out of by studying lots of math so the leadership will think you're a geek with geek potential rather than a jock with command potential. then they'll offer you a chance to fly a plane, because you can't be stupid and fly a plane and everyone knows you're good at math. but flying a single-man plane is lots of work, you have to be at 100% all the time you're in the air, so you can transfer to *big* planes with multi-man crews and co-pilots, and since all your co-workers really want to transfer *out* of big planes because they're not flashy and heroic, you keep getting promoted and promoted until you're the first person in your class to make captain. eventually since you know everything there is to know about big planes, by being the only officer in the entire navy who's flown them for an entire career, you start inventing new stuff that makes even less work for yourself. stuff such as autopilots and navigation assistants. then a war breaks out, and you figure the safest thing to do is to fly rescue missions in your flying boat picking up downed fighter pilots, which paradoxically allows you to garner decorations for heroism. then after the war you retire honorably as a junior admiral, known for your amazing exploits as the man too lazy to fail.

what's the best job for a lazy person?	i've talked about this guy before, but: we have a specific security guard we've had for 13+ years now and is pretty useless. the security guard lives there and has a tv. he watches telenovelas most of the time. all he does is open the gate, and doesn't even bother to even inspect though, since according to his logic 99% of people who can afford a car aren't bad/harmful people. he doesn't ask names or house numbers, just opens the gate whenever he sees a car. *anyone* can come in if they have a car, he doesn't even inspect faces. **and do you know the worst part?** when moving in to the privada, you are supplied with your own control remote. the gates are also automatic.	19	39873	bo3owh	end7s2s
what's the best job for a lazy person?	field engineer. hear me out. field engineers are often salaried, and are given territories with a list of things that need completed as well as their due dates and barring a few emergency callouts, that's the full scope of their work. or, if they're of the flavor of fe that i am (energy distribution), they do global work but only have seasons where they are busy and occasionally deal with callouts during off season. so as an fe, you spend a few months out of the year busting your ass and working long days, and once the busy time ends, you sit at home for weeks and play video games or do whatever you want while collecting a paycheck. i just spent the past 12 days binge watching dbz, replaying persona 5, and storyboarding my webcomic. you can't really be lazy until you actually become a field engineer though. something something about being responsible for multimillion dollar equipment and such.	19	39873	bo3owh	end4abk

what's the best job for a lazy person?	i once worked for a company that had a major database replication every night. sometimes, that replication would fail. if it did, they wouldn't know until morning and then all of their reports would be wrong causing quite a bit of chaos. they promoted me to the software team because of my limited sql skill, but for the first few months my only job was to literally watch a progress bar to see if it stopped moving for more than 15-20 minutes, then call and wake up the db admin if it did so they could debug and restart the replication. no one else was in the building at this time.not even security. i literally brought my 360 in and played mw2 every night, all night for 2-3 months. before the day shift showed up (since the optics would be bad even though i had literally no other responsibilities in the beginning) i just packed everything in my backpack and left. eventually, they realized i was much more valuable than that and i got a great deal more responsibility.but that was a pretty crazy lazy few months.	32	39873	bo3owh	end1eqg

if you could keep any animal as a pet and it would be 100% friendly and loyal, what animal would you pick?	"let's think about this realistically. the title stipulates the animal be ""100% friendly and loyal,"" which is assumed only to extend to you, the owner. we'll also assume op meant the animal was automatically domesticated to a reasonable extent. however op doesn't mention any secondary attributes of the animal - here are some criteria we must consider before making this fateful decision. is the animal territorial? prone to attacking others? is the animal mentally dependent on social structures? does the animal require a specific diet/large amounts of food? does the animal have a penchant for marking territory with offensive bodily odors? what is the animal's circadian cycle? does the animal exist? (looking at you, dragon people) does the animal require a specific climate/environment? can the animal adapt to confinement? does the animal enjoy destroying your house? (looking at you, tickles) does the animal shed? does the animal hibernate? is the animal's disposition affected by the biological prerogative? does the animal urinate/defecate without discretion? does the animal have behavioral triggers incompatible with modernity? therefore, looking at the criteria, we can confidently conclude that the only reasonable choice is. **drumroll*\* **a polar bear** because fuck it; it's a goddam polar bear."	5668	35022	bpw8r2	enyftyk

if you could keep any animal as a pet and it would be 100% friendly and loyal, what animal would you pick?	"eagle golden or bald, doesn't matter to me. both are awesome. (edit4: for the record, i'm 99% sure having a bald eagle as a pet in the us is illegal, unsure about a golden eagle.) absolutely no doubt a freaking eagle (if an elephant is not available). i mentioned this in the elephant comment above, but i was surprised no one mentioned it below. * 30-40 useful year lifespan (in captivity, in the wild normal lifespan is 15-20 years, oldest found in the wild was 32 years old), but can continue living for years to come with my help. (after that timespan they lose the ability to hunt effectively and flying becomes more taxing, but the can still live with help.) * eagle therefore badass * eagle vision can find things that i can't see * eagle vision can lead me on hikes and or help with search and rescue * eagle can hunt for me if i get hurt in wilderness. * eagles are regal af * eagle can retrieve any lost balls/frisbees on roofs * eagle would take awesome go pro footage. ""oh you have a drone, yeah that's old school, i have an eagle, it lasts all day."" edit: it could also be my source of income. falconers at airports make a good deal of money chasing away birds, similar jobs exist everywhere and are very specialized. edit2: as for limiting a beautiful bird from exploring, absolutely not. since the eagle would be 100% loyal to me, (and i would assume we would have some sort of understanding), i could simple tell it to go off and do what it needs to do, and come back when it's done. being 100% loyal, it absolutely would. hopefully, it would choose to nest on my property, and teach its children to also trust me, therefore i'd have an entire brood of loyal eagles. muhahahaha"	74	35022	bpw8r2	enyzw2d

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i had a really uneven trim with a couple of bald patches in it once, so i just asked the barber to shave my head completely and i'd start over from zero. he tried to charge me for both haircuts, but i refused to double dip.	17477	34674	bmlzqs	emy4aiv
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was about 6 we had a mobile hairdresser who came to our house. i was a real tomboy so mum asked them to cut my hair fairly short. when i saw in the mirror i ran outside, climbed a tree and refused to come down for a couple of hours. i think my views were clearly transmitted	1425	34674	bmlzqs	emybn7q
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked for a skin fade that tapers into what i have on top. she went down to skin alllllll the way up. told her this isn't what i asked for, she got snarky and said i needed to be clearer next time. i paid the bill after she shortened the top to better match the now bald sides of my head. i may not know all the names for barber equipment, but i've been getting this haircut for years and literally everyone but her was able to produce what i requested.	11469	34674	bmlzqs	emy91ja
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	never complained about a haircut. but once when i was halfway thru and the women who was just before me that had the same lady came back and started complaining about how my current hairlady did a terrible job and she wanted her money back. my hairlady and complaining lady get into a heated argument about how complaining lady was talking on her phone the whole time and this caused the bad cut. thought they were about to take it outside. &#x200b; really a terrible situation to be in. half cut hair, an emotionally charged haircutlady, and not the best feeling about haircutlady. quite awkward. thank you supercuts	695	34674	bmlzqs	emy7ttj
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i chose a new style that, as it turns out, i didn't like how it looked on me upon completion. no fault of his, i just didn't like what i chose. didn't really fit me like i thought it would. i had him shave it bald and had him try something else several months later. much better. i'll still have him experiment from time to time, even be his guinea pig for something he wants to try.	3478	34674	bmlzqs	emy69z1
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	had a barber offer a 'hot towel shave' at the end of my haircut because he was trying to kill a few extra minutes before he clocked out without having to take another waiting customer. barber used a mach 3 razor and absolutely butchered my face. half way through the shave people just kept staring at me with blood running down my face while the barber was packing some corn starch bullshit in the scrapes/cuts. he said 'wow, you have really sensitive skin' and i replied 'most skin is sensitive when you fucking remove it with a razor'. i just pulled the towel off and walked out of the shop, bloody, half shaved and fully pissed off. my brother thought i got jumped on my way there was so much blood on my shirt/neck. best part is, i only got the haircut for professional headshots being taken the next day. yeah, that didn't happen. shitty part is, guy was my go-to barber for a few years. haven't been back since. edit: a word edit 2: obligatory thanks for the silver stranger, my first one. *sniffle*	6566	34674	bmlzqs	emyefwq

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i wanted a buzz cut. she was not willing to cut off that much hair, assuming i'd be upset and get angry. seven times she trimmed off a millimeter and asked me if it was okay. i went out, bought myself a pair of clippers, had a buzzed head in about 12 minutes, and have not been back to a barber since.	12006	34674	bmlzqs	emy7rfc
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"she shaved my side burns up to about an inch and a half above my ear. i didn't say anything, just sat there looking pissed. she goes ""it'll look good if you put some gel in it."". i went up front to pay, thought about not paying, paid anyway. 4 people got up and left behind me who were waiting. never again mastercuts. never. again. edit: i had to wear a beanie for a month during a hot summer in ga until they grew back. a baseball cap wouldnt cut it. my boss was against me wearing a beanie at work initially until i took it off."	10176	34674	bmlzqs	emyadwo
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"not me, but my dad. &#x200b; went to get our hair cut before a soccer game back when i was about 12. got mine first, was fine. sat down while dad got his hair cut. cue the barber doing the usual holding the mirror asking if everything looks good, my dad sits still for a minute quietly and says sternly: ""that's the worst fucking haircut i've ever had in my fucking life."". everyone just sat there for what seemed like 10 minutes before we just got up and walked out, nothing else was said. i was beyond fucking embarrassed, and the haircut seemed like the same fucking haircut my dad had gotten since 1980 - no better or worse. still not sure if he just did it to avoid paying, which would be *very* likely, but he maintains to this day it was a fucking terrible haircut."	4693	34674	bmlzqs	emxzd14

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a kid, my dad and i would go to the local barber. however, once i became a pre-teen (when you become self-conscious about your hair) my dad and i both noticed our haircuts were getting shittier and shittier. the next time we went i watched the barber focused on what the barber was doing while cutting hair to see if i could identify what he was doing wrong. it turns out he had become so complacent that he would fixate on the cubs' game on the tv hanging from the ceiling while cutting hair, not even looking at the person's head. i told him it sucked and never went back	2373	34674	bmlzqs	emy8zov
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	im someone who hates bangs, they dont look nice on me and they annoyingly tickle my forehead. every time i meet my barber she keeps insisting on giving me bangs and i always say no and it clearly pisses her off until one time she accidentally cut a chunk of my front hair and would have to give me bangs to make it look good now. i knew she did it in purpose cuz she was playing with my front hair for a bit before suddenly making the cut. that was the last time i went to her. thankfully my current barber agrees with me that bangs arent my style. edit: holy shit this blew up. if people must know i didnt tip her and didnt have to pay the extra time it took to cut the bangs but it did take me a whole year to finally grow it out and get the style i wanted.	8029	34674	bmlzqs	emxvma8
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a kid, my mom would always take me to the same place to get my hair cut, and i would always end up crying because that lady clearly had no idea what she was doing. i didnt even hold it in until i left the place, i would just tell her that i hated the look and start crying. my mom kept taking me there thinking i was just a stupid kid that would never be happy with their haircut. she was wrong. now that ive changed several hairdressers, ive been going to the same one for a few years and i really adore her.	10075	34674	bmlzqs	emy5s4b
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i wanted my hair cut very short. i keep it short now, clipped #1 on the sides and #2 on top. back when this happened i think i asked for a #3 clipper on the sides and finger thickness on top, blended to the sides. she picked up the clippers and popped in a #1 blade and went right over the top of my head like a reverse mohawk and then said 'oops, you wanted a 1 on top right?'. i had to get it #1 all over. this was the day before my friend's wedding that i was going to. i looked like a goon.	1658	34674	bmlzqs	emy9pp9
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i have really thick hair with natural wave, i also have cancer. over the past couple of years while i've been battling i have had a really hard time getting haircuts because stylists can't seem to face cutting my hair. first haircut after diagnosis, my hair was well past my shoulders and i asked for a pixie cut. when she was done it was still way too long so i asked her to go shorter, she trimmed a lot more and i gave up and said ok. it was still 8 inches long on top and she didn't use clippers. it made a huge mess when it fell out a couple of weeks later. first haircut after finishing chemo the first time my hair had gone curly. my stylist trimmed the absolute minimum she could, i looked like an old lady with a perm. i asked her to go shorter around my ears so it had more shape to it and she said no because it grows slower there. she also would not use clippers. i cried because i hated it so much. second haircut, now back in chemo so my hair was thinning a bit. my husband got a stylist to come to our house. again i asked for a pixie cut, again i had to ask her to go shorter, again no clippers even though i specifically asked for them. last haircut, couldn't face another stylist so i took my husband's clippers to my own head. i made a mess and my husband helped clean it up. now i have a sloppy asymmetrical pixie cut and i am happier with it than any of the others. still not sure what i'm going to do when it needs trimmed again.	237	34674	bmlzqs	emyiglj
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"it was a $5 vietnamese joint so expectations were to be tempered, but it was always good enough for me, especially since i'm a dude and i don't need to worry that much about my hair. one time this lady gives me the jim carrey cut in dumb & dumber and i was like, ""yeah, no, uh. how about you just. break it up a little in the front? not so straight?"" she was a good sport about it."	2814	34674	bmlzqs	emy3jtz
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	my hairdresser and i had a pretty good relationship, and i had short hair that i wasnt emotional about, so she asked if she could just go wild and surprise me. when i saw the result, id ended up with a weird uneven pixie cut. i told her that it was very cool, but would be too difficult to maintain every day, so could she please cut it down to a regular hairstyle. she redid the cut uncomplainingly, and i walked out happy.	14410	34674	bmlzqs	emxssg1
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"it wasn't a haircut but a blowout. a simple blow out. i was on an anniversary vacation and i wanted to treat myself to a blow out. it was $25. we were staying in a nice inn and i called the recommended salon and booked an appointment. this is a very small town in a place far, far away. the brand new girl was doing it and she had no idea how to do a blow out. i have had them before and she was clueless. i debated what to say and when she turned me around she asked me if i liked it and said ""no"". she called the manager over (might have been owner) and the owner started to argue with me that stylists have their own style to do blowouts. the manager re-did my blowout in 1/3 of the time and she did it right. the new girl checked me out and i told her that it was the manager's duty to train her and the manager was at fault. i asked her not to feel bad but to demand to be trained so that she could become as great as she wanted to be. i paid the bill of $25 and tipped the new girl $15. that poor new girl was not equipped and was not being supported. i hope she continued and asked for her training."	5434	34674	bmlzqs	emy3bha
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	im a guy and have long hair. i usually go to a female hairdresser at a salon but i had recently moved to a new place and found this highly rated barber shop that did cuts and shaves and i decided to give it a chance. i called ahead and asked if anyone there was comfortable cutting long hair and if so to make me an appointment with them. i went in with my hair about halfway down my back and said i wanted it just above my shoulders. the big thing was it had to be long enough to be pulled back and out of my face (it was necessary for my work). this guy nods and proceeds to start cutting just below my ears. my hair is curly and so curled up even higher as soon as he let go. he got about halfway around my head cutting a straight line before my expression made him go get someone else. the only female at the shop came over and audibly gasped. she tried to fix it but it was terrible. had to wear a bandana or hat at work for the next 3 months while it grew back out. the manager asked and i told him i was very disappointed and that they should have just admitted they dont do that kind of cut upfront. oh and they gave me a $5 discount and told me to please come again -_-	1961	34674	bmlzqs	emyhzy2
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i go to a place near my work. it's the standard barber shop staffed by vietnamese people. i've been going there for years and they are very nice. there is one guy who works there and he is great. i always use him, even if i have to wait. one day i was in a hurry, had no time to wait. so i elected to have one of the girls cut my hair. well. she didn't do it right and it looked awful. i told her.

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	when i was a young teen, 15 or 16, i had hair down to my belly button. i wanted it cut to my collar bone because my hair is thick and hard to take care of. my normal hairdresser was delayed into our appointment due to one of the dying hair things breaking and the other being taken so i was paired with a different one. this girl couldn't do an even cut. she kept trying. so she kept cutting so one side would be 3+ inches longer than the other. i watched in the mirror in horror, speechless. she eventually sees my face and goes to get my normal hairdresser. my normal hairdresser just gives me a sad look and says she has to even me out and that she was sorry. she had to cut it to my ears. she didnt ask if i like it. she just said i didn't have to pay. my eyes were watering by that point. it was horrible. never went back.	18260	34674	bmlzqs	emy3vlo
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	this only happened to me once. i'm not sure how she did so badly on my hair. it was all weird and uneven and she missed parts which is hard to do when you're just getting a classic crewcut. she was super young though so maybe it was a lack of experience. i politely told her no this wasn't going to work but it was going to be ok. i got up, paid and left her a tip (she did her best). then i drove down the street to another hair place and had someone there fix it. hopefully she either got better at her job or chose a different career path. i now no longer go to great clips or any of those types of quick haircut shops. i go to the same stylist over and over which is fun because it's like we're having these long conversations with month long gaps between them. plus she gives me a beer each time i sit down to get a trim.	6128	34674	bmlzqs	emxm4x0
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	as a mixed race (half black half white) man, i find that i never like my haircuts. my hair is very curly, but also wavy, so neither white barbers or black barbers know what to do with it. there was only one time i liked my haircut, it was cut by a latino man. i went back a few months later to get it cut by the same guy to find out that he moved. i started cutting my own hair, and let me tell you, its impossible to get an even fro when you cut it yourself. i gotta find me a guy.	589	34674	bmlzqs	emygbj6
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	my hair is pretty short so there's not much to mess up. i get it cut often cuz my hair grows thick and i have to maintain it for the military, so i tend to go wherever i can get in quick and cheap. i like it really short on the sides; like if lacroix cut hair, that level of hair-to-scalp ratio. just a hint. but the last time, i was out of state and stopped by a rinky dink little barber shop. after i got it cut, the lady flipped me around to look in the mirror (i was facing away) and it looked like almost none was cut off. so i asked her to cut more, and she reluctantly agreed. once again it was way too long. so finally i just told her 'just cut it all off' because now i was not only fed up with my thick hair, but my haircut experience. finished up and left. i still left with it longer than i normally like it.	1479	34674	bmlzqs	emy2tol
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	after years of wasting money on horrible to unsatisfactory haircuts, i invested in a good clipper set, watched a few youtube videos and trim my own hair now. my initial thought was, if i mess it up, a) at least it won't be paying someone for it, and b) i can always do a crew cut 3 years later, best $30 investment ever. went from decent to pretty good at cutting my own hair.	372	34674	bmlzqs	emyiywy
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i get my hair cut one day at a school. i get a pretty basic haircut. 1.5 inches on top, shorter on the sides, off the ears. there is a reason i get it cut at 1.5 inches on top, much longer than that it does a weird bozo the clown thing, much shorter than that it just stands straight up. he cut it 1 inch all over my head. i looked like a chia pet.	10894	34674	bmlzqs	emy3fpr

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"oh man. this happened to me just last month. i was growing out a pixie and my front hair was down to my chin, and the back was halfway down my neck. i wanted a trim at the back so it could even out with the front hair and look more like a very short bob. now, my fatal mistake was going to a brand spanking new salon. i figured that since i only want a trim from the back, it shouldn't be that hard for any stylist, right? wrong. she fucked up so bad. i swear, she just picked the scissors and went snip in straight lines, like how someone that doesn't know how to cut hair at all would do it at home. i explicitly told her 3 times i want a trim just from the back. she started from the back, and before i knew it, she'd come to the sides and snipped them off. i still remember my growing feeling of dread lol, that okay maybe she's just making it all even. but no. around a couple inches gone of all my hair that i tried so hard to grow out. she went in to blowdry, i stopped her and went home. ugly-cried. took a picture of the back of my head and ugly-cried some more. sent it to my boyfriend, who convinced me to go right up there and ask for a refund. went back, the stylist kept arguing with me that ""a trim means we cut off all the hair, not just the back"" even after agreeing that i told her explicitly that back only. she called her manager, who offered a refund of what's equivalent to roughly $3 (3rd world country). i told her i want $8 or i'm not leaving. i looked like a damn mushroom and told her so. she silently surveyed me, then took out $8 and said ""we're so sorry"". i left and went to one of the most top salons in the city and got another pixie that i love. its still kind of hard growing it all out again when i wasn't mentally prepared to go short again, but it's all okay. https://imgur.com/nrgzwqc.jpg here's a picture right after she cut it and i went home."	168	34674	bmlzqs	emypzgf
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i had an important job interview - truly critical. i'd moved to los angeles based on the offer of a lucrative job at my cousin's sound studio - only to have him tell me when i got out here that he had no intention of paying me. so i was broke, and desperate, and only had a part-time gig that wasn't adequate to pay the bills. get an interview at a super cool startup. big money, great job, great company. but i looked kinda shaggy and unkempt, it had been a few months since i got a cut. i was broke, so all i could afford was supercuts. i told the woman i wanted the same cut i've had for ages - short, a #2 on the sides, faded up with some length at the top so my cowlicks don't go crazy. she gets to work.and takes a huge divot out of the back of my head with no guard on the trimmer at all. the only way to ""fix"" it was to shave off the rest, and since it went from the middle of my head to the top, it was impossible to fade in, too. so i just had a whitewall on the sides, leading a sort of half-assed high-and-tight. it looked godawful. she knew it. i told her how important it was i look my best the next day, what was at stake - and that this was seriously going to detract from my professional appearance. she apologized and offered me a free cut to make up for it. like i'd come back for another cut after this disaster! there was nothing to do but gut it out. (i got the job anyway, in a major turning point in my life. months later coworkers asked what was up with my crazy punker haircut when i interviewed. told the story and laughed.)"	322	34674	bmlzqs	emygp93
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	can speak for my mom here, her old hair dresser literally had a mental break down while cutting her hair. he just kept cutting and cutting, until my mom started to feel like he was cutting for too long. at the end she had hacks of hair left in random parts of her head. had to use clips and extensions for years after to make it look normal. the same dresser cut a piece of my brothers ear off too. hes a nice guy, just clearly shouldnt be a hair dresser.	1251	34674	bmlzqs	emy81fx
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"when i was 16, i went to the hairdressers with a picture of how i wanted it to look. there was a poster of a girl in the window with a cute hairstyle, but not really my thing -- but the hairdressers convinced me it would be *perfect* with my face shape, ""be brave and try something new!!"", all that bs. i was awkward and reluctantly agreed. it turned out awful. i don't know if the hairdresser was a trainee, or if i just didn't have the right face style after all, but god damn it was the worst hairstyle i've had since i cut my own hair at age 5. i cried. they didn't offer a discount or anything, just told me ""it looks great/you'll get used to it"", the usual. i never went back, and i've cut my own hair ever since, always looking significantly better than that abysmal job."	654	34674	bmlzqs	emy5ez9
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i was 6. my first day of school was the next week. my grandma was convinced that i should be getting a boy-like cut, because that was a thing back in her era. i ended up looking like a boy. i didn't want to. i wanted to have long pretty hair. it took 10 years for it to grow back.	282	34674	bmlzqs	emyc3kj

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	just after college i started going to an ultra-cheap salon/barber shop in the decrepit mall where my mom's offiice was. usually the haircuts there were pretty good for the staggering price of $6, but one time instead of the haircut i asked for the stylist gave me a bowl cut and shaved off my sideburns. it made me look uncomfortably like moe howard from the three stooges, and i started getting my hair cut at more expensive places after that.	137	34674	bmlzqs	emyb2qe
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	for the first 18 years of my life i had my hair done by the same stylist. as soon as i was able to make decisions for myself i would tell her what i wanted done. and every time, without fail, she would ignore my wishes and give me the haircut that she wanted me to have, all the while telling me how she knows better and how i should just be grateful. and to make matters worse she would insist on cutting my hair in the bathroom and sometimes her daughter would come in and pee while i was getting my hair done. i never tipped her once. i guess thats the price you pay when your mom is a hairdresser.	1023	34674	bmlzqs	emyn7n7

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i got a simple haircut (i am female), it came out too short. when i show you how long i want my hair, it's the end result on dry hair, not during the haircut on wet hair! but hair grows, so i said i wasn't happy, paid and left. just went to a different place next tine.	227	34674	bmlzqs	emy954r
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i'm usually not picky when it comes to haircuts.it's hair after all, it will grow back. i was getting a typical fade about 5 or 6 months ago and this woman, for some reason, faded each side of my head in different spots. so much so that the only way to fix it was to jump down to a #4 and buzz the top of my head to try and salvage the blending. i literally had to stop her and ask what she was doing and she was like what? nothing is wrong so i put my fingers (pointed towards my head) on each fade line and you could clearly see they were off by almost an inch and i was like ""dude, look at this"" her response was i am not a dude! i just kind of looked at her weird and said uhhh yeah i know that i just used dude as an expression. so she proceeds to buzz my head and at the end she was like i'm not going to make you pay for this and i said yeah, i wasn't planning on it. i still go back to the same supercuts but if she's working i will avoid her."	891	34674	bmlzqs	emy2yzd
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i didn't realize just how bad the cut was until i went home and washed my hair. i called up got setup with a more experienced stylist and got a decent (albeit very short) haircut. afterwards she gave me coupons, yeah not a refund even a partial, but coupons for another cut. i told her i wouldn't be coming back and to not bother. never did go back.	729	34674	bmlzqs	emy4tso

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	clients telling you they don't like their haircut happens about as often as someone telling you they do like their haircut, and you want it to. the client is a representation of your work. you want them to be happy about their hair so they go tell all their friends how much they like it. i'd rather have someone tell me they aren't satisfied while they are still in my chair so i can fix it. be vocal about your hair, people!	594	34674	bmlzqs	emxtuvx

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	literally a few weeks ago, and my 30 year old ass cried. i did what i now know to be a mistake; went to an unfamiliar hair stylist to have my hair colored. i hadn't colored my light brown hair in a few years and wanted to add some dimension with highlights and lowlights. i pulled up a lot of reference photos, the hair stylist seemed to understand what i wanted, and she got to work. i should have realized something was wrong when she only put about 18 foils in my hair. i have pretty fine hair, but in the past stylists have used way more than 18 foils. unfortunately i had taken my glasses off for the appointment, so my vision was 80's level standard definition and i couldn't really see what was happening. when she finally started to dry my hair (i said i wanted some texture and she round-brushed it straight.) i put my glasses back on and saw stripes. blonde and red stripes in my ashy brown hair that started a quarter inch from my scalp. i would have been very on-trend in the late 1990's. amid my flashbacks to spice girls and butterfly hair clips, the stylists asked if i liked it and i just sat there agape like a catfish. she repeated the question and the other stylists and customers started side-eyeing me, and the intense focus mixed with my inability to lie caused me to start to break and the tears started. the head stylist swept over like a tall, beautiful superhero and pulled me to the back before i could make a scene. she looked over my hair and let me (quietly) get my frustrations out before insisting on fixing it. she put in more color, more depth, touched up the roots the last stylist left undyed, and styled it in textured waves. it looked much better, but still not really what i wanted. i'm trying to do it right this time by trying out other stylists for smaller things like trims and styles before deciding to color again. edit: grammar	86	34674	bmlzqs	emys6bl
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	not me, but i went with an army buddy for haircuts once and mine turned out fine. his was abysmal. his hair was so beyond repair after they spent over an hour trying to fix it, so they didn't make him pay. they should have paid him for the amount of shit he got for it later. i'm still surprised he didn't just have them buzz it all off.	159	34674	bmlzqs	emyb9vp
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	about 2 years ago, i was looking for a new barber and decided to try out a shop near my work that's been around for years. small place that had a solid 4 stars on yelp. so i got my cut, gave it the okay (the lighting in there was low for the sake of ambience), and headed off to a soup kitchen where i volunteer. i then spent the whole afternoon getting the piss taken out of me by homeless dudes (and we're not talking light homeless dudes here, but super homeless folks who, as you can imagine, don't have great grooming regimens) for my messed up fade and the hairs sticking out of my head in random places. in a move that went against every grain of my conflict avoidant being, i called the shop up when my shift was over, explained that i wasn't happy with my cut, and asked them to make it right. they agreed. but when i went back, i had to sit in another barber's chair, explain to him point by point why i thought the cut was awful, and then i had to sit there as he fixed it while my original barber sat just feet away from me glowering. 10/10 would never do again.	61	34674	bmlzqs	emyhv4y
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	well my first mistake was going to a wal-mart salon. i had blonde hair half way down my back. i wanted a long a line cut and died a brownish auburn color. i guess one of the first red flags was she had me turned away from the mirror but i figured thats just how she needed me. ten minutes later this woman calls someone else ovet to finish it. uh okay? another little while later the new lady said she tried to fix it and spun me around. im freakin out because mistake? my hair is touching my jaw line and its purple!! i cried so hard and then they tried to charge me 70 dollars. i left and had to get it cut into a pixie.	206	34674	bmlzqs	emyeomg
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i didnt say i didnt like it. i was too afraid of the comb. i was probably 12 or 13, and the person who had cut my hair since i was little was changing careers, so i needed a new person to cut my hair. so the next time i need a haircut, my grandmother takes me to this shop near her house. the lady overall was fine. she seemed nice enough. i did notice some of the teeth of her comb were missing or broken, but i didnt think much of it. oh boy. when she started combing my hair, it was like she was trying to shove the comb through my skull. its not like i had tangled or unkempt hair, she apparently just thought proper combing technique included pushing the teeth of the comb against my head with all her might. she was making some comment about me having dandruff or something and that i needed to wash my hair more often while doing this, and when i finally flinched she said see? your scalp is tender. no, actually, youre using that thing like a weapon. when i got done, she had basically given me a bowl cut. she asked me if i was happy with the cut (i will give her that, she didnt do the thing some adults do when dealing with children and defer to the parents, ignoring the child completely), because youre the customer, what matters is if youre satisfied. i didnt particularly like it, but i didnt want her to use the comb on me again, so i said yes. and we never went back there again.	112	34674	bmlzqs	emy4ugv
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	if it's something that they can fix there and then, then i'll say something, and when they do fix it i'll tip extra. didn't think that was out of the ordinary to be fair.	238	34674	bmlzqs	emxu8p8
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	after hearing the customer in the barber's chair next to mine complain bitterly to his barber about the haircut he had just received, i made sure to compliment my barber. it was a genuine compliment, too, because he did a great job. the guy next to me was just trying to embarrass his barber in front of others, much like a mean-spirited customer in a restaurant that takes obvious pleasure in berating the waiter.	692	34674	bmlzqs	emxu7vc

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	this is on a related note, but i once told a stylist not to touch my hair. it was at a paul mitchell school. i've gone to the school here in the past many times, but i guess it's only been recently that they've just started letting student stylists in without any kind of skills, abilities, competence, or anything. i don't know why they would let them on the floor. i noticed this at toni and guy schools as well. i don't go to schools any longer to get my hair cut. now i'll just pay good money and leave a good tip at an actual salon. anyways, i digress. i came in for a haircut last year to the paul mitchell school. i'm a woman and have a really easy hairstyle, it's moderately short and not a lot of layers of anything. i requested for a stylist to just trim my hair so it would grow out evenly. a student senior stylist comes out to shake my hand and i notice that she barely speaks english. she seems uncertain, shaky, and like she doesn't have a clue about what she's doing. she then takes me back to get my hair washed. she doesn't wet my hair thoroughly and proceeds to shampoo my hair when it isn't even wet. we then get back to the floor, and she starts separating my hair out into sections. after stabbing me with the pins and pulling out my hair, i told her to stop and that i wasn't comfortable letting her cut my hair. i felt terrible, and this was the only time i ever did something like that. a class instructor gives me a hair trim, and it took him less than 5 minutes. i was out the door. i tipped the woman, anyways, but i realize now i just should have given it to the instructor. what a weird and awful experience. now i will easily pay $50+ for a good haircut, because that kind of mess just isn't worth it to me. sometimes there's really good student stylists, but i'd rather not take the gamble.	204	34674	bmlzqs	emyduxn

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"finally, a chance for my story. even though i'm late and no one will read it. this was about 20 years ago. i was visiting baltimore for a month, staying about 45 minutes outside of town in pikeville. i needed a hair cut, so found sam's barbershop in the phone book within walking distance, advertising $5 haircuts (first red flag). i went there, and it was downstairs in anything hair salon (2nd red flag). i found it downstairs, and there was no one else there (final red flag). sam was older, but nice, so i sat down and he started cutting and talking. he proceeded to tell me about his life, including how he emigrated from poland as an adult to avoid hitler. i did some quick mental math, figuring out he had to be (at the youngest) in his very late 80's. i also began to notice he had to hold himself steady with one hand, while cutting with only one hand. this meant he couldn't pull the hair up or anything between his fingers, he could just hack away with scissors. i tried to mentally signal my wife to pull the fire alarm, but she just read her magazine. i then just resigned myself to my fate, and listened to his story. to quote bill from king of the hill, ""it's only hair. it'll grow back."" he finally finished. he didn't ask what i thought, but i said thanks, and gave him $5, plus a $2 tip, which by his reaction was the first tip he'd gotten in about 40 years. i drove straight to the next barbershop i saw, and when i walked in the barber's eyes got really wide for a second until he could regain his composure. i said ""it's a little uneven, to which he replied you think?"". i asked him to do what he could, so he cut it down to about 1/4 inch on the sides, and about 1/2 inch on top. cost me another $20, but at least it was even. all in all, an interesting day. i was out of town, and enjoyed the low maintenance cut. if my head weren't so lumpy and irregular, i might have kept it. plus, it was quite a treat to hear a first hand account of someone evading hitler. 8/10, would do it again. and it did, in fact, grow back."	127	34674	bmlzqs	emyst1x
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i went to ulta (yes, a place you would expect them to listen to what you want) and got a different lady than normally. now i have curly hair, and i know that an inch and a half off on straight hair is different than on curly hair. so i told her i wanted an inch and a half off, so she was so so persistent on me getting layers (i will never do layers, they're terrible on me) and i was like, no i didn't like it and she said that once you get old you will want layers and i'm just like uh ya. sure. and so when she was done cutting, my hair already dry and product in it, she literally said she only cut an inch off. she also said that whenever someone asks for a certain length, always do half an inch less than what they asked for. she blatantly told me that she doesnt do exactly what they want. and the bill was 50 bucks and she still doesn't do the length i want	193	34674	bmlzqs	emycc1f
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i once had a barber cut my hair with some sort of industrial flowbee. steve the barber in his overalls certainly did disappoint. it was by far the worst attempt at a haircut i've ever received. &#x200b; he did the standard how does it look. i pointed out that it was all lopsided. steve soldiered on and tried to fix it. this somehow made it worse and now much shorter. he asked again. i said no it looks even worse, and told him to stop cutting it. he told me i wouldn't be charged if i wasn't happy. i said something along the lines of i wouldn't have paid for this if you did. i then had to go get it cut somewhere else and still looked stupid since i look awful with short hair. &#x200b; the moral of the story is don't budget shop for haircuts. find someone capable and tip them so much that they remember you when you come in and want to make sure you come back. the only problem is that if they ever leave it's absolutely terrible.	38	34674	bmlzqs	emyauwl
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked her to shorten my hair from half-way down my back to a shoulder length bob cut. she was a little too excited about it and i thought she was just being nice. she gave me a pixie cut. the haircut she had. i should have said no but i felt too bad to do it. i know it wasnt my fault because i asked her twice if she could leave it a little below my shoulders since it would curl back up higher. my curly hair went from being manageable to the curls being too short to even pin back in some areas.	115	34674	bmlzqs	emycqru
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	my younger brother is blessed with thick curly blonde hair. but growing up nobody ever knew how to style it lol. he got consistently bad haircuts. circa 2003ish. my brother got a bad haircut like really bad. my mom is a karen and as rude as possible goes i dont know if i like it the hairdresser offered to cut more and my mom agreed. sort of anti climatic. but i will never ever forget this. the haircut still looked really bad. there was no fixing it. she pretty much cut an m in my brothers hair. he has a widows peak. it was like vegeta from dbz. the kids in his class began calling him mighty matt	136	34674	bmlzqs	emyby6m
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i once asked my girlfriend in college to cut my hair, because i had a gotten a last minute interview for a job. we went out to the backyard and i don't know if the sun was in her eyes or if she was just nervous, but as soon as i saw the first snip she had taken from the front, i knew she had cut too much off. she took a step back and looked like she was about to burst into tears. i assured her that it was okay, because there was nothing that could be done about it except try to not go any shorter. she finished up and the end result was kind of goofy looking, but i wasn't too upset. i knew it would grow out and i really appreciated her doing that, and although i kept thanking and reassuring her it was okay, it took at least a day before she fully believed i was okay with it. had it been a professional, i probably would've been more upset, but everyone makes mistakes and bad haircut is only temporary. edit: here are a couple of pictues from about a month and half after the haircut. you can see what i mean about the front being too short, and it does look a bit better but it looked really bad right after the haircut. https://i.imgur.com/dcp4xs2.jpg https://i.imgur.com/wo9tx2p.jpg	371	34674	bmlzqs	emy1i3h
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	every haircut to me is like being on a makeover show since i can't see much without my glasses. so when she asks me if i like it i put on my glasses and take it all in at once. i made an involuntary and unflattering noise first then just responded with a no. she looked like i just killed her kitten. her two nearby coworkers immediately turned into awkward seals and i got the impression this wasn't the first time this has happened. she started to say something and i just put my hand up. i then went to the counter, paid, and went home. my so fixed it best she could. i waited a couple weeks and then got an early haircut fix the issues.	36	34674	bmlzqs	emyhuor
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	it was two weeks before my wedding. i just wanted a quick trim. my wedding was in the midwest and i live in california, and i had to do bridey stuff in town before i could meet with her. i figured id get a small clean up before flying out. i had a stylist set up in the midwest but my hair was stupid overgrown. the salon called and said the stylist called in sick, but they had another that could do it. i go, show her the picture. bangs are eyebrow level and layered in the photo. ive used it a bunch of times as my default bangs photo. in one fell swoop, she completely cut my bangs off. i looked like fucking julius caesar. except worse. because the bangs were cut like _-_ across my forehead. completely uneven. cue immediate tears. i start shaking my head and looking between the photos and my face. ive never had someone immediately cut my bangs off like that. its usually a gradual process - but nope. this lady just went chomp and they were gone. they comped the cut. but, i had also scheduled an eyebrow appt since they were also overgrown. except - nobody was available to do my eyebrows. so i was left with the shittiest haircut ive ever had, paired with overgrown eyebrows, and a puffy crying face. thank fuck for my stylist back home. she told me to take biotin twice a day, and managed to clean up the cut so i looked nice. its not what i wanted for my wedding hair originally, but lesson learned i guess.	33	34674	bmlzqs	emynhwe
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"sort of related: for my girlfriend's senior prom (i had graduated the year before) i was going to straighten my hair with one of those chemical kits. i have rather wavy and hard to fight hair, especially for a white guy. so i picked up some chemical solution called ""africa's finest"" or something and had my mom handle it for me. well it took longer to apply than we expected. it smelled like kerosene and acetone. my head started tingling after the 15 minute recommended time. so i washed it out and the area around my scalp was bright red. and the next day was the prom. so i went to bed with my newly straightened hair. and i woke up with the whole side of my head matted. the chemical actually burned through my scalp and it started healing over the hair. that was fun to pull out. and some of the tips fused together to boot. it looked alright though. but my mom felt pretty bad about going all trench warfare on my skull"	36	34674	bmlzqs	emynvog
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"finally, a post i can tell a story to. &#x200b; it was the weekend that i was going to go talk to my future father-in-law and basically tell him i was going to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. we all basically knew the answer at this point, but i wanted to make a good impression, so i was going to get a haircut and dress nice and all that good stuff. &#x200b; i go to my usual haircut place, wait for a bit, and get called to the seat by one of the guys working there. i'd never seen him before, but it's a supercuts, so someone basically gets a license to work there and can move around to other places. whatever. i sit down and tell him my usual haircut, a #3 on the sides and back, a little bit longer on the top and front, and finally thinned out. &#x200b; he gets the clippers out, turns to say something to the woman working next to him as i take my glasses off, and moves to do the back. i hear the buzz of the clippers and feel metal on the back of my head, and realize with my fuzzy nearsighted vision he's forgotten to put the guard on and has now shaved a paved driveway onto the back of my head. he pauses and gives me an ""oh-shit"" look, puts on the #3 guard and then does the rest of my sides and back as i just let him stew, just watching him as he did the rest of my head, it legit felt like he thought i didn't notice. he finished, and said, ""so. i made a little mistake,"" as he held up a mirror. *no shit,* i thought as i sorta laugh in my head, but a dead sort of laugh where you know you're going to look like an idiot. ""i guess you'd have to take it all down to the same level, huh?"" i say. the dude panics, turns to the woman next to him, who just gives us the *what the fuck happened* look and shoos him off of me. she studies it for a while and basically says that she'll try and salvage it as best she can, but it's going to be pretty different. after a few minutes, it looks a bit like [gary oldman](https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/system/images/photo_albums/gary-oldman/large/14-oldman-thefifthelement.jpg?1384968217) in the 5th element mixed with [macklemore](https://www.respectmyregion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/macklemore.jpg). she swears that it's up and coming as a professional look, and i just sort of side eye her and sigh and say ""let's just take the rest of it off. we tried."" i get the shortest buzz cut i've ever had in my life, but hey, it ended up being free. &#x200b; anyway, i meet up with my friends for a drink; all the guys had a massive laugh at my expense, all the girls were horrified for me, my girlfriend was caught somewhere in between. and she became my fiancee a month later, when my hair grew back in."	65	34674	bmlzqs	emyh55r
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i only ever have my mom cut my hair, and there was this one time she messed up. she cut my hair *waaaay* too short, so short that you could see my earlobes. i hated it so much. when she took a photo of my, she literally told me to look happy for it because i was so mad. she ended up giving me $5 as an apology.	59	34674	bmlzqs	emyfc1n

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"i didn't say ""no"" directly to the girl that cut my hair, because that would be super awkward for me to do, and i didn't really notice how bad it was until i got home and looked in the mirror. i did notice eventually though, so i decided to go back the next day, hoping that the girl that had cut my hair wouldn't be there. i walked in and didn't immediately notice anyone that looked like her, so i figured i was all good. when asked if i was there for a haircut, i said no, that i'd just need a quick fix. when the girl looked closer at my hair, she said, out loud, ""oh yeah this looks awful, let me fix that for you"" and walked me over to her station. it was at that point that i remembered the girl who had cut my hair the previous day had mentioned that she herself was getting a pretty drastic haircut that night, and to my horror, she was cutting hair at the station *directly* next to me then. i just hadn't noticed her before because she had a different haircut. so there i was, wanting to melt into the seat as the girl fixing my hair is making comments out loud about how bad it was, asking where i'd gotten it cut, etc. and all the while the culprit was standing 5 feet away. i didn't think it could get any worse, but when it was all finished she walked me up to the counter, and needed the manager to come over to comp my haircut and find my receipt from the previous day. unfortunately, the other girl finished her haircut shortly after mine, so she had to awkwardly stand there as the manager looked up my previous days check, which i'm sure had her name on it, while she was waiting to cash someone out. i wanted to die."	26	34674	bmlzqs	emyifjo
people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i went to this salon in birmingham, alabama. it would be the first haircut i had gotten in that city. i did some research before hand and they were highly rated, also they gave you a glass of wine or a beer for free so i made an appointment with a random hair stylist (im male in case this is important). anyway, i check in, get a cheap ass beer (no complaints there) and take a seat for my haircut. this lady didnt use buzzers which i was used to, my old hair stylist would only use scissors and was kind of proud of the fact. he just always gave me a stellar haircut. well she just grabbed a chunk of hair between her index and thumb, cut if off and tossed it aside. she wasnt grabbing it between her index finder and middle finger like i was used to but hey, different stylist, different haircut. she did this for about 3 min and i was sweating balls. eventually it just became patchy and looked awful. like the cynthia doll from rugrats. asked her to stop, rinse me out and just call it. i went home and had to buzz my hair. left a brutal review and the owner contacted me. he felt awful and was sincere. demanded that i accept a refund. i changed my review after he contacted me and gave me a refund but i never went back.	24	34674	bmlzqs	emyri9c

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	"short version: i said no once and it wasn't much better but i had lost faith in that barber so accepted it but gave a bad review. the owner contacted me and wanted to make it right. she cut it and it was better, went back a few times but for a $40ish haircut i really should have been happier than ""okay"". eventually found a better barber for $15. more details: i'm a guy, and i used to be in the military so i transitioned from super short hair to a still conservative but longer fade. my hair is short on the sides and long enough on the top to be messy, disheveled, get bed-hair and hat hair. it's a very simple haircut, i thought. so this place that charged around $40 for a haircut seems nice. they give you a cocktail and there's old-timey magazines (a stray playboy) and wood everywhere. this guy cuts my hair and it is absolute shit. it's not balanced, my bangs are crooked, i'm not happy. i ask him specifically to balance out over here, straighten this over there, i specifically tell him where i want fixed and what would look better. again, this is still pretty short hair in the scheme of hair. guy barely improves it at all. but clearly he's hopeless because i gave him explicit feedback, so my trust is gone. i say it's fine and i pay and leave, leave a bad review on google. owner reaches out. she does a much better job, but awkwardly not as good as i expected for as simple as my haircut is. because i liked the pampering and she was nice and helped me out in good faith, i went back a few times, but was open to new places. eventually talked to someone who had good hair, and found a place that was way cheaper and got consistent results. my barber rocks, it's only $15 and takes maybe 15 minutes to cut my hair. surprised it took that long to find."	18	34674	bmlzqs	emygeyl

people who have said no to the barber when they asked if their haircut looked good, what's your story?	i asked for a cut brushing my shoulders, no layers, a lob you might call it. what i ended up with was a can i speak to the manager haircut and i couldnt hold in my distraught over it. i would consider myself a usually super laid back and easy customer, not a complainer, but that just was.awful. i had even showed him a picture of exactly what i wanted. like i said, im not very confrontational and struggle to assert myself sometimes - when i said that it wasnt what i had asked for, he got very defensive and angry with me, and i decided it wasnt worth the hassle of demanding a refund. hair grows back. but thats the last time i buy a haircut voucher on groupon.

"a coworker when he speaks in english at work meetings. we are all mexican in the department and we all have an accent (some more than others), but his problem is not the accent, is the constant pauses and repetitiveness when he speaks, you might think is just nervousness, but no, because what makes it unbearable is that he is very prepotent and rude. so you have this man, not able to speak at a fluid speed, speaking sometimes non-sense, but in a very condescending manner. &#x200b; if it is a meeting on skype, i remove my headset. if it is in person, i leave the room. also he is veeeeery confident in skills he clearly doesn't have. i can't stand him, he embarrasses the whole department when he speaks. we've spoken with our supervisor but asks us to be more lenient. not me, i'm tired of it. &#x200b; maybe is not the sound itself, but it was the only one that came to mind in the ""typical sound in my life i can't stand"" category."	161	40837	blzj3m	emsp1zj

if 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	probably nothing. a few reasons. * the name of the store is not 7/11, but 7-eleven. * the corporation is japanese owned, and japan has more stores than any other country (japan = 20,700 vs. us = 7,854). even though the date of 11 september 2001 is remembered as a dark day for most in the us, to the rest of the world it was just another day. * the japanese, as do most countries in the world, write their dates dd/mo, rather than mo/dd as in the us. in most of the world, 9/11 is seen as the 9th of november, rather than the 11th of september as in the us.	65	64715	bvgvkh	eppgv7q

what trend did you follow as a kid that makes you cringe now?	sagging my pants because a kid told me you dont have to wear them that high and i was afraid of being bullied for high waters after that, thinking that my clothes had to have a polo (couldnt be uspa) logo on it, or be plastered with abercrombie & fitch, aeropostale, american eagle (still wear their jeans though lol i love the stretch ones they make) or hollister logos all over it for it to be considered swag. also, my obsession with jordan shoes, often dreaming of the day id be able to buy 100s of them. i was so obsessed with trying to dress a certain way to appear trendy. now i couldnt care less about that stuff lol. i rock clothing from wal mart (those color assorted t shirt packs are great lol) and h&m and until my shoes (usually vans) give out entirely, imma keep wearing them. its all fun when your parents are spending their money but as i got older, i realized i didnt have money to be wasting on useless stuff like a jordan collection right now lol. bonus: i was one of the many people that dyed their hair like odell beckham when he first came into the league. didnt even know who he was at first, thought he was a linebacker but he had cool hair so i got it just like his (blonde curly mohawk thing). i was the first one at my school to do it and people thought it was the coolest thing lol, then it caught on (kids asked me how i did it and were telling me i looked like odell) and almost every boy was walking around with blonde dyed hair later that year in my school lol.	479	34730	bpr8xn	enwpyjb

of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	scream. the tension and terror were built up perfectly and the eventual killing of drew barrymore's character was shocking. not just in its brutality (which was *quite* graphic for its time), but because such a major name was killed off that soon into a movie. the opening kill is a tried and true horror trope, but it had never been done before with such a big name so early in a film. for the rest of the film, every time you saw a big name show up (neve campbell, david arquette, courtney cox), you weren't sure if they were going to make it to the end of the film or not.	15635	50785	buso57	eph2pvq
of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	the opening scene in reservoir dogs completely sums up everyone's character. * mr. pink goes on his logical rant about why he doesn't tip showing he is the logic thinker. he also claims always to be the one acting like a professional. later in the film, he tries to keep the group together and stay professional. * mr. white takes the book from joe when he gets tired of hearing him drone on and on about toby showing they are close friends * mr. blond offers to shoot mr. white if he doesnt give the book back to joe. he even shots him with a finger gun. foreshadowing mr. blonds violent actions later in the film * finally, when joe ask who didn't tip mr. orange immediately rats out mr. pink. mr. orange, of course, is the undercover cop and the rat.	13450	50785	buso57	eph211h

of all movie opening scenes, what one sold the entire film the most?	john dies at the end. solving the following riddle will reveal the awful truth of the universe, assuming you do not go utterly mad in the attempt. say you have an ax - just a cheap one from home depot. on one bitter winter day, you use said ax to behead a man. dont worry - the mans already dead. maybe you should worry, cause youre the one who shot him. hed been a big, twitchy guy with veined skin stretched over swollen biceps, tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. and youre chopping off his head because even with eight bullet holes in him, youre pretty sure hes about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face. on the last swing, the handle splinters. you now have a broken ax. so you go to the hardware store, explaining away the dark reddish stains on the handle as barbeque sauce. the repaired ax sits undisturbed in your house until the next spring when one rainy morning, a strange creature appears in your kitchen. so you grab your trusty ax and chop the thing into several pieces. on the last blow, however - of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store. as soon as you get home with your newly headed ax, though you meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded last year, only hes got a new head stitched on with what looks like plastic weed-trimmer line and wears that unique expression of youre-the-man-who-killed-me-last-winter resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life. so you brandish your ax. thats the ax that slayed me, he rasps. is he right?	42	50785	buso57	ephv3y4

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that nearly every place you apply wants you to do it online. no, going in will not help you get your foot in the door. more often than not it's just going to annoy them. also - super annoying when people don't believe you about this so they go in and ask for an application and are told to apply online. like.i legit could have told you this would happen. i was at target, working behind the counter at the customer service desk, saw a guy walk in and insist on applying in person. they found him a physical application and once he left they threw it in the trash. that was one of the managers who did that by the way. update : for clarification he walked in, asked for a physical copy, said he couldnt put in online because he didnt have a computer, the network for the store was down - he was friendly, shook hands, and had decent qualifications. they didnt care. no, i dont find it shocking that you, your son/daughter, or your family pet got a job walking in some place. not everyones experience is the same. every time ive followed up on an application, went in person, or tried to see a manager i get told to leave and that they will contact me when ready. at two places, they even put me on hold for half an hour before hanging up when i tried to follow up on an application. call backs were rejected. every job ive gotten involved either a phone interview followed by a start day, an online interview followed by a start day, or getting called to meet hr. target was just the most overt example, but nowhere ive worked has ever accepted walk-ins, taken physical anything, or let people talk to the manager about employment. for reference, ive worked big-box-store jobs, factory work, and non-chain stores. your experience may differ, but you are the exception, not the rule. even my local generic corner store and a new-age accessories shop want online apps, and my neighborhood family-owned pizza place has a detailed website.	7603	32855	btexev	eoy9j6d

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"that you can take on over 100k in debt (because your parents' income decided you got basically nothing for student expense assistance, even though there's no guarantee your parents will pay for anything), and go on to get a phd. and still only make national median income. yep, doctor median, that's surely what i signed up for. (drowning in debt, pls send halp.) whoever the old fucks are who decided to get rich off of the education of future generations can burn in hell for eternity. edit: there's another comment here that conveyed what i was trying to say far more eloquently. we did everything we were asked to do, and when our lives didn't magically work out it's still our fault for not doing ""it"" hard enough or well enough. we weren't the ones who fucked the housing market, made billions off of students, inflated the acceptable interest rates on all forms of debt, or outsourced many of our profitable industries to other continents. i'm not saying we wouldn't have done some of that if we didn't have the chance, but i'm sticking it to the previous generations for thinking they were perfect when they actually fucked up a lot of things."	641	32855	btexev	eoy5yh6

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"the whole ""just go get a better job/put out for a promotion"" line of thought. a lot of the time we just cant do that, and one particularly annoying part of it is because you're still sitting at the top. in my profession there is very little to no upward movement, the median age for a full time teacher where i've worked is in the late 50's-early 60's. nothing against them, as sometimes they can have brilliant ideas/techniques. but it's frustrating to look at the job ladder and see no-one going up because people wont/can't get off, and you can't get on. edit: wow, never thought my most rated post would be voicing my vague frustrations to the aether. not sure if to thank you guys. just to clarify, i know that this is a symptom of the greater failings of how things are run. it wasn't meant to be an ageist dig in particular, just my frustrated observations on my current situation. i'm actually moving out of my country in a few months for a job with a ""typical"" amount of hours. while here i have to compete with the casual market and those f****** relief apps. for those who don't know: when a relief position appears, the school uses the app to send a message to everyone on their lists and it's practically a race to accept it. have to spend all morning watching my phone like a hawk for even the chance at one of those positions. it doesn't help that if i don't get enough work in the next few years then i just drop off the government's books and have to re-get my qualifications. partially the reason for such high teacher turnover/losses in graduates."	10180	32855	btexev	eoxf7z8

"we may very well be the first ""over-educated"" generation in the history of this country. most of us have college degrees, and very sizable portion of us have graduate degrees too. we have these because we basically have to in order to even have the chance of making enough money for a comfortable life as adults. we are a little pissed off because we all grew up being told that if you do ok in highschool and go to college, you'll be able to get a job that'll pay you well-enough to live the life you want to live. then, we did those things and when we got to the other end of it, it was all basically jerked away."	8079	32855	btexev	eox2ny1

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that most of us have actually done customer service jobs our whole life.and when people talk about how millennials and the younger generations are all about instant gratification. each and every one of us has vivid memories of old fucking dirt bags throwing goddamn tantrums because they didn't get their way right that very moment. old people have absolutely no patience for anything. younger people typically have more manners. edit: holy shit, it seems i hit a nerve. i'm a low level shit posting troll and i don't know how to deal with this positive attention. thank you for gold and silver. and yes yes. i get the fact that not all boomers are like this. and not all millennials are nice well mannered saints. the only thing a millennial might find more annoying than a boomer is another millennial since self hatred is kind of our jam. but it's the media that presents one side on a more favorable light verses the other, so let us younger schmucks have our opportunity to vent.	10386	32855	btexev	eoyailk
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i have a house now that cost 120+thousand dollars more than it was when you raised me. and its smaller than the house we grew up in. it took me until i am 34 to get it, and you got yours at 21. you worked a summer job plus bartending for 3 years while you were going to school, and you made enough to pay for your college and masters, and for my mom to stay home. this was your life. mine is not that way.	203	32855	btexev	eoybwyj

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we aren't children. we aren't 15 year old kids eating tidepods( the less than 2 dozen that did that). we are college graduates, trade school grads, union workers, and every other slice of the workforce. we have trades, kids, experience, and retirement plans. not as many as should, but the economy the boomers left us is what we have to work with. we aren't stupid kids or out of touch hippies going to college to get degrees in mermaids and avocado toast. we are, it seems, the only damn grownups in the us half the time, and it is exasperating that so many people seem to believe otherwise. edit: thanks for the silver and the gold. i appreciate the support in my old age haha.	8729	32855	btexev	eowvqti

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that jobs arent as stable as they used to be. were making way less money than before, its exponentially harder to find a job, and the expectations for the average applicant keeps rising. were now asked to constantly be on call to come back into work. remember that day off you looked forward to all week? nope, boss called you in. you dont show up to said call-in because you arent going to work unless its overtime pay? youre fired. need to find another shitty job for shitty pay. set schedules are never a thing anymore (at least in my experience. even at my research internship i would constantly get called in on weekends when it was stated before that i wouldnt work weekends). were expected to be the most efficient, mindless, obedient generation of citizens and workers. it sometimes seems like were never doing anything because were just so goddamn exhausted that even doing daily tasks is a struggle. were asked to constantly be working efficiently even away from work. rest isnt a thing anymore. our generation is getting burnt out and sick of the issues that order generations dumped on us, yet were blamed as the ones who caused the problems. op keeps asking what solutions we can bring, and the only thing i can think of that will really solve the countrys financial problems is to just wait for the boomers to die off. its a bit morbid to say but its true. theres just too many people and not enough money to go around. unfortunately the younger generation (millennials, genz) has to bear the burden of 2008s economic clusterfuck. sorry for the rant. edit: this blew up holy shit. some naysayers replying to me saying im asking for too much or i should be grateful im working. i am grateful to work. is it too much to ask that my life and my work have stability? the older generation had a lot of stability and consistency in their jobs. we dont get that luxury. yes ive worked retail but that was before i declared my chem major. i now work at a small research lab and have a side job as something to do during the summer so im not bored. its not that i want handouts (and quite the opposite i want to earn what i get), its just that i want to be able to know that i wont be laid off at the drop of a hat because my boss decided to spam my inbox and voicemail demanding me to come in when we specifically agreed for weekends off as i got the job. unless its overtime compensation im not showing up. any reasonable person would agree with me on that. /rant part 2	1755	32855	btexev	eox8zos
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	this is for the older people. yes you are wiser than us. yes, you have more experience than us. but your advice usually does not apply to the times. thats not how we did it back in the day. yea. thats the point grandma. times change. people change. technology changes. dont get mad at us because we lived in a time of increasing convenience. and most importantly, its ironic how millennials are viewed in a bad light but we are expected to solve all the worlds problems. edit: i understand that old age usually does not come with wisdom. but man the older people ive come across say the wisest things. and for the most part they do know what theyre talking about. there are a few old people who talk out of their a** but for the most part, wisdom runs through their blood. edit: this was my first day on reddit after 30 days and in that time period i earned 7,000 karma and a silver award. thanks so much.	5596	32855	btexev	eox47l1

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"i've been at my current company for nearly six years now, in that time i've been promoted once and my salary has increased nearly 60%. that's makes me a massive exception among my circle of friends. most of them graduated around the same time as me (about 7 years ago) and are on their third or fourth job, one of them is starting his fifth job in six years after the summer. one guy spent three years at a job because they kept telling him he needed to put in the time in order to get promoted. when he finally left he had gotten two raises of 1.5% each in those three years, and his older colleagues said he was leaving ""for the money"" because his new job offered him 15% more than what he was earning. even when he took that offer to his boss he still didn't get offered the promotion they promised him when he started there. the reason millennials aren't loyal to companies anymore isn't because we're out for ourselves, it's because companies have been systematically abusing the expected loyalty to string employees along, nickel and diming them every step of the way."	65	32855	btexev	eoyj83r

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we want to get married, buy a house, have children, all the things our forefathers did, but we can barely afford to keep ourselves going. add to that the worsening political and actual climate and we're all pretty hopeless.	188	32855	btexev	eoy3dm9
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	despite what news networks or studies say generations can vary greatly. i was born in 96 but am considered a millennial where i'm from because it's all back woods and technology gets here a little slower. if i was in a city in a more advanced area i'd be gen z. i had chalkboards in elementary school, whiteboards and a few smart boards in middle school and then back to white boards in high school. computers were put in my school when i was in 5th grade. i saved to a floppy disk. i know what it feels like to take a big rubber dodge ball to the face. you kind of get the point. we don't expect things to be handed to us, we just want affordable access to things. my parents were able to buy a house at 19 and support two children on a full time and a part time income. granted it was a struggle sometimes. i'm 23, work about 80 hours a week (it varies based on staffing), plus go to school and can't afford rent in my area. my current job did require education already. i can't afford to go to the doctor despite working in healthcare. we aren't lazy like the news says, we work our assess off just to get nowhere. i have three days off this month, plus school. those of us who don't want children don't hate children, we know we can't afford to raise them. we are inheriting a fucked up economy, a dying plant and get nothing but shit because were just lazy and entitled. not to mention in the us were straight up getting our rights taken away. were pretty angry about it. edit: shit man someone gave me silver. thanks! y'all are just trying to make me blush now. i've never gotten awards and now i have 2!? now were on 3 guys. i'm starting to feel like i'm important or something. i can't keep up with you guys! thanks so much!	999	32855	btexev	eoy01zf

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	we are not gen z.i'm 30, have a career, an apartment, own my own car.we are the 15 year olds with fidget spinners eating tide pods. we didn't always have the internet at home, we played outside when we were kids and we remember 9/11 as an event not something in a text book.	560	32855	btexev	eox2g9c
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	jobs aren't guaranteed. my brother worked for a big surf clothing company for almost 8 years as their big tech guy. paid well, occasional travel, discounts. good job. said company has been doing massive layoffs since he got there. mostly people who'd been there forever. he got scared when the guy who'd been there 10y got let go so he looked elsewhere but they liked him and matched his offers twice. finally this month he got laid off. out of nowhere. scary stuff. he's on unemployment but he has enough saved that he'll be fine for a while. pretty sure it only happened because he'd been there so long and was paid so well. i think their strategy is to constantly bring in new people who they can pay less to save money. it's stupid.	48	32855	btexev	eoyrcrm
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that there are still only 24 hours in a day. i remember being in my mid-twenties and working three jobs, plus a volunteer position at a tv studio to boost my resum, to the point where i literally finished working at the first place, changed uniforms in my car, then drove to the second place and started my next shift. the weekends played out the exact same only i drove to a third place. i was literally living on about 3 hours of sleep a night, working 7 days a week and only making an equivalent to a full time cashiers wage. by the time i had paid my weeks rent, groceries (the bare necessities), fuel and transport, i had twenty dollars left over. i was even selling stuff on the side through etsy but it only made me petty change. i had nothing to contribute to savings and had zero social life. but of course, all my older coworkers are telling me to just get another job, work harder, and to stop being so entitled.	164	32855	btexev	eoyagqv

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we will be the first generation that will never be able to retire. most of us have no kids, no pensions, no savings, only started working in our late 20's, and by the time we retire, if we make it to old age ,we will likely work until we get too weak or senile, and then be stocked away in a state facility somewhere, 4 beds to a room, with not enough money to even own a cell phone. just stare at the wall alone miserable waiting to die. no kids or relatives left to visit us or help remind us who we are. just rotting away losing our minds &#x200b; i spent the past 10 years or so mostly working for retired people. nice folks, but very demanding and constantly complaining about their pensions and retirement funds not being high enough to do more travelling or other things, but most of them live in paid-off homes that they own and their pensions and retirements is giving them a really decent lifestyle. something that will not exist for me. and millions of others my age. we are just expected to work right into the grave, no rewards. &#x200b; but those old people still expect us to rush and huff and puff and answer to every little demand and criticism. like a good little slave. only existing to serve them, and to hell what happens to us when we reach that age.	252	32855	btexev	eoy34fg

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	baby boomers screwed over the millennials big time. cheap primary, secondary and university education? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. once these people grew up, they wanted nothing to do with high taxes to support cheap university education, especially. so they drew up the ladder of educational opportunity and more or less said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us these great educational benefits without us taking on any student debt. so we got ours! now youre on your own! world-class infrastructure? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. well-kept highways, bridges, tunnels, and subway systems are for young people to use, not old people since most old people are going to be dead soon. bridges that are well-kept, for example? those last 50 years, and will mostly benefit the young. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us great infrastructure, but that means we have to pay higher taxes to keep this up. but we dont want to pay for that! now youre on your own! cheap housing in large cities bursting with economic opportunity? thats for americans born between 1946 and 1964. now that the baby boomers are old and have lots of property in these citiesespecially nice coastal cities like san francisco and new yorkthey dont want high-density anything because it destroys the character of the neighborhood. the worst of the worst nimbyist people are baby boomers who got in on this urban property pretty cheaply 40 years ago or so. and they want to keep those property valuations way up. so that means no high-density anything, which means crazy high property prices and very high rents. and who bears the burden of this? the young, the people trying to start their careers. so the baby boomers also said, screw you, children and grandchildren! our own parents gave us cheap property in cities, but now we dont want our property values to go down, even a bit. so no to high-density development, no to apartments, no to affordable housing! now youre on your own! this is the harsh truth millennials must face: the old are screwing us, the young, big time. and the old dont like hearing this harsh, harsh truth because they dont like to see themselves as the bad guys who achieved much lower taxes after the 1980s by ruthlessly cutting back on things that benefit the young, the things they themselves enjoyed when they were whippersnappers. the national debt is zooming upwards, and we the young are going to be paying for that, not the baby boomers who will soon depart. the old are always the victims, but never the bad guys.	40	32855	btexev	eoyf9tk
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	i remember at 28 i tried to get a job and when i told my mother the pay she just shrugged and said yeah pretty standard. this was for assistant to a foreign ambassador's mission to the eu. my dad will retire and his replacement taking over the same job will be paid half what he made. he will never be able to climb to the same level. the truth is that if a millenial wants their parents' standard of living one needs to hustle, go into a high paying field or move to a different country. the worst thing about being a millenial is it is embarrassing to hustle, to struggle, to be poor, to reuse etc. we are supposed to keep shoving coal into the sinking ship of our society. all the while smiling that we can afford a lower deck cabin.	110	32855	btexev	eoy3z8a
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	economic advice and plans that worked for you when you were a teenager/young adult in the 60s or 70s doesn't apply in this economy. stop telling me to go into buildings and ask for a job and invest in a middle class home at age 30.	169	32855	btexev	eox9rk6

"we will absolutely undo just about everything boomers did politically. i look at these old ignorant politicians and just think ""oh just die already"" also my fellow generation please learn to use basic tools and google your home issues first. i don't want to charge you 600 dollars to tighten a screw but i will. cause tradesmen are dying and soon 600 dollar repairs will be a bargain. i want to fuck over the boomers not you. learn to fix shit."	109	32855	btexev	eoy9xa0
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	graduating from college looking for a job, when all the baby boomers and people of those kind of generations arent retiring from their jobs. thus not freeing up the job market. then they complain that we cant get jobs! well i wonder why, karen!	39	32855	btexev	eoy4eh4

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"many of us are not cynical. previous generations made lots of attempts at improving every substantial system out there, made lots of improvements, but none of those systems are perfect. many of us are actively working to improve them. every generation must address problems that previous generations could not solve/created. basically, we aren't lazy and are doing our best to solve problems in spite of levels of debt relatively unknown to previous generations, a global climate crisis that is the result of 200 years of irresponsibility, and what many of us view as a (small but powerful) class of stubborn plutocrats who desperately cling to power while having no substantive ideas regarding the fundamental challenges of our time (most of which are not ""culture war"" issues). we are educated, conscientious about the world and history, open to a wide variety of ways of living, and improving every day. our generation is slowly taking the reins of power and i personally cannot wait to see what kinds of solutions we implement. also i still think that the idea of ""generations"" is a bullshit artificial distinction. people are born every day and arbitrary demarcations aren't helpful."	213	32855	btexev	eox55gp

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	that we are one of the most educated yet underpaid generations. my grandparents were able to buy a three bedroom home in toronto for $16,000. that same home is now worth $800,000. i can not afford that on a $40,000 a year job. but i went to school for four years and graduated with honours. yay me.	105	32855	btexev	eoxl3wy

millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	"as someone on the older end of being a millennial who's managed to be fairly successful, while i will take credit for ""creating opportunity"" (being a go getter, skilling up, etc) fact is luck played as much if not more in my success. the days of simply being a professional and getting your degree resulting in a lucrative job are long gone. (not that you shouldn't do those things, just that used to be the finish line with a job at the end of it, now it's the starting line for a lot of careers) i will also say even my advice is probably already outdated to the point of no longer useful things have change so much, advice for the 50 and 70s is all but useless in modern times. toss into the pot it now takes two full time workers in decent paying jobs to buy an okay house and that's if you're in good health and manage to get lucky enough to get a decent job. (and that was before jacked up tuition rates and student loans killed that option) fact is while i'm a millennial those of us from 1980 to 2000 have had it leagues easier than those after 2000, and honestly i'm expecting things to get way worse before better. the sad fact is, if things don't change our future is looking really grim, yet we look at our parents living it up thanks to the situation they grew up in, and frankly we're jealous, frustrated, and upset, and yet we're looked down on as if we're to blaim for the shit show we've inherited, and when we try to come up with solutions we're told ""nope, you dumb kids are narcissists who just want hand outs"". i don't want a hand out, i want people who work 40 hours a week teaching to at least be able to not starve to death it some gutter, i think that's a pretty &$!?# low bar. yet even that appears to be too big an ask right now."	27	32855	btexev	eoyjp5c
millennials, what is one thing that the rest of us just don't understand?	millennials started in 1981. i was born a year later. the generation(s) before me made sure school was unaffordable, health care unreasonable, housing impossible, the environment unlivable, had no problem endorsing two never ending wars for my generation to fight in, and really, wed just appreciate you all stfu when we complain about all the afore mentioned things. seriously, shut the fuck up with all your back in my day bullshit. we may have smart phones, but we also have the grimmest outlook for the future in any generation in modern history. as someone born in 82, a veteran of multiple silly wars you voted for, with no hope to ever buy a home, barely able to afford rent if i want to live in an area with actual jobs: fuck you. vote out of self interest for once; vote in the interest of the americans that will follow.	29	32855	btexev	eoyov5b

"i agree with most of these tips but man i remember my trip to malacca, malaysia. we walked up to a stall where an elderly lady was squatting down just in front of the sidewalk with a plastic basin and washing the dishes in it. stray cats were coming in from the alley and licking at dishes. my first question was is this a *restaurant*? upon closer inspection: yes, it is. my second question was who on earth would eat here??? then our guide brought us inside. looks like: *we are*. food was amazing and delicious and despite fearing the worst, nobody got sick. edit: wow, i didn't realize this comment would be so popular. thanks reddit! to answer the question ""why would you even eat there?"" our trip up until that point had been very well planned. stayed in a great holiday inn with a delicious international breakfast buffet. tour bus was very clean. the highlight of the trip was when they took us to a pineapple farm and we got to sample (hint: supermarket pineapple has *nothing* on the fresh stuff). most of the restaurants we had been taken to were, by western standards, quite clean. this one was definitely an outlier in that regard but by this point we had developed a trust in our guide. i would never have even thought to walk into this place on my own accord, but then i would have missed out on some amazing food. i should post some pictures. pretty sure i have a pic of that cat!"	9093	55698	br19bh	eoa054g
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	pastry chef here. as much as people say avoid specials, i can't speak for everyone but at least in desserts/breakfast pastries, if you see something new its worth trying. chances are it's something the chef has been working on for weeks on their own time, there's a lot of love and effort put into it. also, the standby if the menu is a book, it's probably not great. the biggest thing to keep an eye on though imo is the staff. if there's pissed off people, get out as fast as you can obviously. if everyone is kinda apathetic and not talking to each other much, get out. that's also a shitty environment, everyone is probably really passive aggressive, and that's going to show. if people seem genuinely good with being there even if it's busy or if there's playful ragging going on, that's where you want to be. the better the staff gets along, the better everthing in the place runs.	18531	55698	br19bh	eo9yyy3

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	if a restaurant has a one-page menu that's usually a pretty good sign, it means their line cooks have become specialists and can usually nail all the dishes listed. conversely, if a restaurant has a giant, multi-page menu that's a gigantic red flag. the longer the menu the better the odds that you're paying to eat a boiled bag frozen meal.	27210	55698	br19bh	eo9yyow

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	cook for a small mexican restaurant here. i always look for how the staff interact with each other. if they all seem to enjoy being there, and coordinate well, more often than not it's because everything is running smoothly and they have a good system, which usually means they know what they're doing and you can expect good food. that's how it always is for the smaller, family run restaurants i frequent anyway, which i believe always have the best food.	25489	55698	br19bh	eo9hg69

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	ive worked in restaurants for over a decade. a couple years in the kitchen and the rest as foh. if your servers response to how is the [item] seems disingenuous, thats a big red flag. we know what goes on in the kitchen, we know the complaints, and we know which items to stress over when we deliver them. servers who pause or seem uncomfortable with that question generally equates to a menu full of stuff we wouldnt eat even as a free shift meal. a good sign is when servers hang out and eat at the restaurant post-shift. generally we are getting a discount but not free food - if we are spending our nightly tips on it, its worth it. edit: woah, thanks for gold kind stranger!	8441	55698	br19bh	eoa1h0a
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"cook at a fancy casual fine dining restaurant here. if your food is out impossibly fast, it's probably something to be concerned about. i'm talking ordering an entree and it's out in like 10 minutes. this usually means it's already been cooked and they just have to reheat it. now something like a salad, okay that shouldn't take any time at all, but you want to make sure your lettuce (or whatever green it is) is still crunchy and fresh, otherwise it's been made before and has been sitting. generally speaking, watch the wait staff. if the majority of them seem disgruntled or upset, things probably aren't great. this often translates to the kitchen so they probably don't care about your food if they aren't being treated fairly. another thing to look out for is the cleanliness of the place. if the restaurant seems dirty or unmaintained, the kitchen is in similar shape most of the time. i've heard people say ""never order the fish on a monday"" or ""don't get any specials because it's probably product that's about to go bad."" but at my restaurant that's not the case. we get orders all throughout the week and our specials are things we are playing around with to see if it could be added to the menu. so i would say just be cautious about that sort of stuff. also it helps to read reviews. i like to read the one star reviews to see why it was rated that way, if a majority of the reviews are for some really stupid shit, and all the other reviews are great, your likely going to get some kick ass food and service. you all know the ones i'm talking about. some karen who left a one star review because her water ran out once during a huge crunch or something else totally ridiculous. how does the place actually smell? does it smell like good food? then it likely is. does it smell like perfume or to sterile when these is clearly food on the tables? that could be a bad sign that they are trying to hide something less than pleasent. that's pretty much all i can think of at the moment. edit: okay since i didn't make it clear what i mean by ""insanely fast"" and i'm getting a lot of push back. yeah. average ticket time should be about 15 minutes. i was maybe being a bit overzealous with the 10 minute turn around, but i was thinking of large tickets when the place is slammed or it just feels like your food came out very quickly."	5650	55698	br19bh	eo9t71u

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	waitress here! if you see any food coming out that's messy and theres sauce all over the rim of the plate, etc, it's likely to mean that the chefs aren't putting much effort into their meals and they therefore will not be very good. all the chefs at my work find it so important that everything is presented well and i agree, so if they miss something i'll check the plates and point it out which they always appreciate as it reflects well on them.	2871	55698	br19bh	eo9lezq
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"there is an abundance of kitchen 'wisdom', popularized by books like kitchen confidential, that isn't always true. ""don't order fish on a monday"" ""specials are made with leftovers or food that's going bad"" ""if the toilets are dirty, the kitchen is too"" ""chefs bleed into your food"" &#x200b; it really depends on the venue. any chef worth a shit is never going to serve bad fish, out of date meat or bleed into your food. the fish thing could be accurate some of the time, but works on the assumption that restaurants have purchased their stock in bulk the previous week, which is often completely false for smaller establishments. that, and the concept of well-done steaks being deep fried or shitty, older cuts of meat may have been true ten or fifteen years ago, but the culinary world has changed so much in the last decade with the rise of cooking shows and celebrity chefs that venues can't afford to cut corners or pull dodgy tactics like that with even mildly clued-in diners that know what they're eating."	324	55698	br19bh	eoa15x2

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	my wife trained as a chef and i cooked in fine dining in college. a long menu is a red flag. if they have 40 different entrees, it means that they are preparing a bunch of frozen ingredients or they have the exact same entree rebranded as a different dish based on the sauce. short menus tend to mean fresher ingredients.	479	55698	br19bh	eo9z21d

""lunch special: 4.99$!"", ""free appetizer from 5-8pm weekdays!"", ""bogo main course wednesdays all day!"" that kind of thing. usually means they're going under and are trying to drum up business. unless they're a chain. regular lunch/dinner restaurants that start to offer brunch. #1 brunch service is the worst, chefs hate it, and are usually disgruntled, #2 brunch is a money maker, companies charge over the top for thin pancakes and orange juice with a splash of 4$ champagne. sudden brunch means the place is trying to make more money, charging double and using chefs that don't want to be there. reviews where the owner is arguing with the reviewer. i saw an argument on yelp where a lady complained her chopstick or something was moldy and gave them 1 star. while it was super unfair to give a 1 star over something they didn't do, the owner got into it with her and they started fighting on facebook. owners that are willing to yell at people who are spending their money are likely to treat their staff the same or worse. meaning their employees are either pissed, or the turnover is high and no one is trained well. edit: spelling"	2909	55698	br19bh	eo9igrf

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	ive done bartending/waitressing for a few years, heres my list: - first of all, ignore the bathrooms/kitchen thing, the people in charge of the kitchen generally arent in charge of the bathrooms, and its normally the servers job, if the restaurant area is busy were gonna skip that when we can, but well probably give it a quick tidy if we use the toilets. - most places opt for paper menus, because they can just be chucked away afterwards, its cleaner this way, however if the table is sticky (and the restaurant area is quiet) then theres probably a few other sticky areas. - check your cutlery, most cutlery barely gets washed, it gets rubbed with soap, sprayed with water and chucked in a dishwasher, its then meant to be polished with hot water when its brought to the table set up area, this is where we actually check it for leftover grime. if your cutlery is gross, chances are your wait staff arent doing their job properly - dont order fish on sundays, most places get their fish deliveries on a monday and on a thursday, fish goes off fairly quickly and on a sunday its really not great. - if your server has long hair and its not tied up check for hair in your food, kitchens tend to have really strict rules on their staff and you rarely see them with hair down and makeup on, if theres a hair in your food its probably from your waitress. - if your (hot) food is out quickly your chef was probably a microwave - if your server visibly has a cold and is still working, dont eat there, theyre either not paying their staff enough to have days off or theyre forcing staff to work in conditions where they shouldnt be handling food, the kitchen staff probably get the same treatment and probably have the same illness	1306	55698	br19bh	eo9wde6
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	please god be clever about ordering. if the place is grubby (such as table not cleaned) staff are just sat down in the restaurant, you hear insane shouting from the kitchen etc dont order shit like lobster. ive worked in the industry for 10 years and a year ago went to spain with my boyfriends family. they all decided on a restaurant they wanted to go to. the restaurant was in a busy area but was quiet (red flag 1) the menus were dirty as were the cutlery already laid out on the table (red flag 2- and yeah i asked for replacement cutlery) the there were more waiters than customers and most were sat down one was drinking at the bar (red flag 3) there was about 50 dishes on the menu (red flag 4) and i saw flys all over (red flag 5) i ordered a vegetarian salad because i didnt trust meat from there at all and told my boyfriend he should do the same. he didnt listen, nor did the rest of his family. they all decided to go for chicken or seafood. they spent the next 2 days vomiting. i enjoyed the next 2 days in the sun.	176	55698	br19bh	eoa1sup
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"this isn't so much about sanitary red flags like most of these, but more about saving you money. if you're goung to get sushi rolls, make sure you read the ingredients. a lot of places have what amounts to a california roll for a premium price. i've told this story before, but it is the best example of what i mean. i worked at a japanese restaurant for a while and we had this thing called a volcano roll and it cost $7.25. a california roll there cost $3.75. the volcano roll was a cali roll cut into the shape of a triangle and topped with spicy mayo that has been heated up with about $.10 worth of fish, literally just a few bits that was not worth it. you are much better off ordering a cali roll and paying $.50 extra for spicy mayo on the side and asking them to heat it up. i had one guy come in with a girl and he ordered a couple of regular rolls like spicy tuna and yellowtail, along with a volcano roll. when served in the restaurant, unless they ask us, we would put the sauce on top so it looked nice, like a volcano. when i brought that roll over he was like, ""oh, i didn't know you guys put the sauce on, i've only gotten it for pick up and the sauce is always on the side. i don't really like it, could you bring me one one without it?"" i tried not to laugh and said sure. i went back and the sushi chef asked what was wrong. i told him that he didn't like the sauce and want one without it. he laughed and said alright, so he took a cali roll, cut it up, and put it on the plate. i brought it back to the guy and he was super pumped. basically this guy paid $7.25 for a roll that would have cost him $3.75 and me and the sushi chef got to split a free volcano roll. normally i would have just told him about it, but the dude was being so arrogant the entire time, i'm guessing to act like he was a sushi expert to impress the girl he was with. i've seen this at a couple of other places too where they slightly dress up a california roll and jack up the price. you don't want to end up like that guy just because you didn't take a few seconds to go over the ingredients."	4047	55698	br19bh	eo9n8aw

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	chef here. an easy red flag is an oversized menu or a menu that goes out of the restaurants theme. if the menu is the size of a short novel its very likely your food is going to be subpar. staff demeanor can be a big one but is hard to judge if you cant see the cooks/chef. its not uncommon for places to have lazy servers with a poor attitude but the cooks still rocking it. if you do see the cook though and their demeanor is poor they arent going to care how your food comes out.	91	55698	br19bh	eo9y89o
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	one thing i haven't seen mentioned yet: the amount of servsafe certificates posted on their wall. servsafe is a national food safety training course that all managers have to take and pass to become managers. it is required in all food service establishments and for every servsafe-certified employee, there should be a certificate visible to customers(similarly to health inspection). so basically, the more certificates you see, the more employees that work there who truly understand food safety. it's an incredibly tough test and you have to actually understand the material in order to pass.	95	55698	br19bh	eoadtyl
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	check your dishes, cups, cutlery. mood of staff. if it has an open kitchen it's probably half decent. cleanliness of place, clutter, etc. if your plate is hot it doesn't mean your food was microwaved. every restaurant i've worked in has kept their plates in a warming drawer or oven to keep them hot.	69	55698	br19bh	eo9z7bk

chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	"not a chef but one that makes me keep driving past is a sign saying ""under new management!"" or something similar. it means the business has already failed (at least) once and either a new owner has come in thinking they'll be able to cut corners better than the last owner, or it's the same owner trying to save face by saying someone new is in charge when there isn't. steer clear of these places. edit: so i realized i was overly harsh with my initial comment and some of the replies had some good points about how these signs could actually lead to positive changes. i was definitely speaking from my own experiences from restaurants that have done this and also ones that my friends have shared in the past. i still believe more often than not there won't be significant changes done to improve these places and that while some people truly mean well, others are just trying to put lipstick on a pig."	577	55698	br19bh	eo9u6f8
chefs, what red flags should people look out for when they go out to eat?	not a chef but from personal experience: if its a small chinese restaurant and they have a tank holding live seafood -- **but they dont clean it** -- that place is definitely going to give you a brutal case of food poisoning. if you insist upon eating at such a place i suggest you tip heavily (if ordering to-go) or heavily flattering the waitstaff and/or asking about what's fresh (if dining in).	211	55698	br19bh	eo9tt0h
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my 4th grade teacher had a reputation for making one boy in her class an unpopular scapegoat each year. lucky me. in previous years i'd been just another kid in the playground, but within two months the other kids wouldn't play with me during recess. one day i refused to go outside for recess. she asked why, and i foolishly told her that the other kids didn't like me. when they came back in, she marched me to the front of the class, and asked for a show of hands, who didn't like me. fourth grade kids (mostly) did what fourth grade kids do. i broke down that night and told my mom what had happened and what had been going on al along. she marched into school the next day, got a meeting that included the principal, and tore the teacher a new asshole. i was still stuck in that class, but the teacher moved on to a new victim. funny thing how self esteem influences academic performance. my school used to give us a stanford binet iq test every year. my score dropped ten points from third to fourth grade, then rose twenty points in fifth grade when i had a nurturing teacher. if you are still alive, fuck you, mrs. ericson.	10378	23473	bu766u	ep8qtmh
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	when i was in high school i got a lot of nose bleeds. like a lot. so i got one in the middle of class and i asked the teacher for a tissue, she said she didnt have any so i asked to goto the toilet to get one then she said no. soon i asked again when blood what dripping from my hands and she yelled at me for repeating myself which is apparently bad. soon a puddle of blood was on the table then i got sent to isolation for disrupting the class. i was then suspended for acting inappropriate during class. she was then fired for putting my life at risk. i gotta say when you get a nose bleed like that, you really see how much blood is inside of you. edit: thank you anonymous redditor for a reward! edit: for those saying im dramatic for saying putting my life at risk it was the school that said it, not me. i didnt consider it risking my life.	9034	23473	bu766u	ep8x43e
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i was bullied really bad. kids kept drawing awful ugly photos and leaving them on my desk with profanity towards my appearance. i had enough one day after dealing with a lot of abuse at home and the bullying at school and when i saw another broke down crying and brought it to my teacher. she just grabbed it looked and asked if i wanted it back. did nothing to help, wouldnt listen to me about the constant bullying and did absolutely nothing. i was in 7th grade and still remember it to this day. edit: thanks for silver friend. also thank to all who wished me well, unfortunately no i wont be doing anything towards the teacher, it was 12 years ago. i wish she learned better, but it was a small town school and as sad as it is, that's just the way it was. i hope i can be a better teacher when i'm finished school.	9090	23473	bu766u	ep8k3yr
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	mine is more of a light-hearted traumatic. in 4th grade i collected yu-gi-oh cards and i had gotten the (at the time) new three egyptian god cards. well i was caught playing with them during class and my teacher took them from me and threw them out. i was devastated after all the packs opened and cards traded to acquire them. i never forgave her. did they ever end up being worth anything before all the reprint boxes? i wouldve loved to see her face if she found out they were worth some coin. edit: the teacher was an older southern lady in her 60s so she was definitely in that mindset that she had 100% say in whatever she did with our personal belongings. pretty sure if corporal punishment was still allowed i wouldve gotten the paddle on several occasions. i wasnt the only one who lost cards that day. buddy who sat next to me had his black magician of black chaos and blue eyes ultimate taken from him.	5560	23473	bu766u	ep85qxk
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	teacher told me i was a liar to the whole class as she didn't believe my grandmother was a world war ii evacuee. she refused to believe me as she assumed my mum was younger than she looked at the time, and therefore my grandmother was younger as well. she thought my mum was in her late 20s when in reality she was in her early 40s at the time.	5712	23473	bu766u	ep80952
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i'm 65, and i still remember when i was 6 and the nun told me to wash my desk and then wring out the sponge, and when i squeezed it instead of twisting it, told the whole class that my mother was a bad mother because she had not taught me correctly. i knew if i protested that my mom was a good mom i would be punished. it still bothers me that i didn't stand up for her. why did that nun have to put me in that position? godammit.	4805	23473	bu766u	ep8rcti
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"didn't traumatise me personally, but i had a first year lecturer in classics who went out of his way to terrorise the class. his first words to us were, ""i suspect as many as half of you cannot read."" he then administered a test, which two-thirds of the class failed. he was not shy about voicing his rather gleeful displeasure. (i did well enough to avoid his wrath, and, annoyingly, get singled out for praise.) he would routinely throw questions at students who weren't paying rigorous attention -- in a three-hour lecture on friday morning -- and then berate them for not knowing the answers. his comments on papers were beyond trenchant: ""are you illiterate?"" ""do you imagine this makes sense?"" ""this is childish."" etc. the unfortunate part is that he was a *superb* classicist. a close second was a novelist-turned-writing-prof who hurled a girl's manuscript out of his office door -- nearly hitting me in the hall -- as he shouted ""this. is. not. writing."" she came out to pick up her magnus opus moments later, weeping. great writer, self-confessed shit teacher."	2084	23473	bu766u	ep8c06u

(it only occurs to me now that that. is kinda dangerous in the wider scope of things.) anyway, my best friend was a boy and naturally, i skipped right off to tell him why suddenly half the class had an assembly all by themselves. my teacher heard about it, got me alone, grabbed me by both arms and shook me.

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	so when i was in kindergarten i didnt make it to the bathroom in time and wet myself. went to the nurses office got new clothes but instead of panties i had to wear a pull up, not a big deal. i guess it was a school policy for kids my age i dont really know. when i get back to my class my teacher loudly says oh good the baby is finally back or something like that. she also knew about the policy and asked if i was wearing a diaper so every other student could hear. i was 5 and felt a ton of shame and humiliated. i started crying and trying to get out of school a lot because of it. my teacher often referred to me as a baby for the rest of the year. also she would constantly ask if i needed to potty or if i was wearing a diaper, like i was a toddler or something.	19630	23473	bu766u	ep87ury
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"so back in 1st grade i was at this private school and despite not enjoying reading i actually loved school and had a ton of friends and it was great, got along with everyone. one day my sister stayed home sick and my parents dropped me off and as i was walking in i said hi to the nun that taught the other 1st grade class. she said hi and i kept walking. as i was approaching the end of the hall she dropped her keys, i heard so i turned around and looked, in between her and i were 2 4th grade boys i recognized from my sisters class. they started to approach her to pick up her keys when she lost it and started screaming at me, that i was rude and awful and some other terrible not so non like things. the boys were confused, i was confused, they were closer, and going to help but she was furious that i didnt help her. i got pulled out of class to talk to the principal that day, between her and the nun i really thought i did something horrible. i was punished and made to feel like i murdered this nun. when my dad picked me up that day i just started to sob, and i didnt stop until we got home and my mom and dad and sister held me. i was having a full blown panic attack, my moral values were being questioned and i was horrified at myself. my parents were furious and they called my teacher demanding to know what happened, all she said was she was unsure and that i seemed to have a run in with the nun. my parents went in the next morning for answers and we got an apology from the principal but not for the nun. and i remember standing at the counter with my big sister, terrified and sad and this nun walks in and says being rude to me again, my sister is standing there horrified, the front office secretary is shocked and my mom ripped this nun a new one. the nun hadnt seen my parents there. my parents went to the head father at this parish and read him the riot act, when he tried to defend the nun they went to our bishop, he clobbered the whole school. but by then the damage was done, i was a target to the nun, everything i did she had a problem with. i stopped being myself at school, i became very insecure and quiet. my sister and those boys took it upon themselves to check on me as often as possible, they became targets too. so at the end of the school year my parents pulled us and we went to a new school. i never got my confidence back. and in 6th grade a new boy joined our class, immediately i recognized him as being one of my best friends from 1st grade, he was in the nuns class. he immediately recognized me and his first words was ""damn sister thomas was a real bitch. huh?"" which for private school kids was a big deal to say. we ended up staying at the same school throughout high school and at graduation when our elementary school group got together for a picture he said ""you never really found yourself again after that. you should try to find it, you engage always been amazing you just gotta find it again"" so fuck you sister thomas you cunt."	3771	23473	bu766u	ep8k204
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"in the 8th grade i had a book report to do for 4 books all due on the same day that was way too overwhelming to do at the time. i had some serious domestic violence going on at home between my parents. spent all my time taking care of my younger brother, cleaning up the house, cooking, and crying from all the stress. it was worth 20% of my grade and the day before it was due, i broke down and told my teacher everything; down to the time when my brother bled from his head from being hit by my dad, to the most recent attempted murder upon my mom. if i had even recieved a b, my dad would've beat the shit out of my mom for giving birth to a stupid kid. he called child services, my parents recieved the call, and gave me the silent treatment for 3 days. they told him i lied just to get out of the assignment. the social worker told my teacher what my parents said and made the rest of my year a living hell. he treated me with such pettiness after that and threatened to call my parents whenever i had either spoken too loud in class, or whenever i was unparticipative in gym. he called my parents for my ""bad behaviour"". home life got significantly harder after that, and my parents told my entire family continuously how stupid i was for telling him. they laughed at me when i cried or got upset about it. years later after repressing everything i was diagnosed with severe ptsd from childhood trauma as a witness and victim of domestic violence, attempted murder thrice, and it took me 3 years in therapy to get over it - it was quick, but it was tough as it was during my university years and i ended up having to take an extra year of school to catch up mentally. i was ready to speak up about my struggles again when i couldnt function anymore as the traumatic flashbacks occured twice a week for hours at a time. i couldn't do a single thing except tremble and live in fear. i was 18 by the time i was ready to reach out for help. fuck you mr. gentle, your name is creepy as fuck, and i really do wonder if being a petty 33 year old to a 12 year old child made your quality of life better. i hope that there's proper procedures put in place to protect children from such experiences. edit: i did not expect for this to blow up! thank you guys for all your kind words and support. it's so sad to read some of your replies. in a way, im glad to know im not alone, but at the same time, it breaks my heart to know that this isn't a rare experience. i'm actually from canada and i thought i would give an update! i'm now 23, finishing up one more course to get complete my bachelors in business marketing. unfortunately things did not get better with my parents. my mother is still with my dad, and after finding out i had a so, their treatment was beyond ruthless. after one more incident, i left for good and have not had any contact since this october last year. yes, it is still fresh and it wasn't my first time leaving but this is definitely the last time. i was supposed to graduate at 21 but ive finally accepted that that is okay. the hardest part, though, was accepting that my relationship between my parents will never be healthy and leaving was the only thing i could do to save myself. for all you teachers out there or for anyone working with adolescents, take the time to listen. even if it's trivial, silly, stupid - you have the power to change their direction in life and give them the motivation to make the best out of themselves. i don't resent mr. gentle anymore, and making that phone call was all that he could've done. just don't become a teacher if all you're going to do is undermine them. your job is to guide them. even if nothing could have been done by the authorities, he didn't need to hold whatever i said against me, truth or not. it doesn't matter. if you need someone to talk to dont hesitate send me a message! life is fucking bullshit but im not going down without a fight lol"	8041	23473	bu766u	ep8bxcn

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"my senior year of high school, my mental health took a steep dive. i was dealing with a lot of instability at home, one of my closest friends had become a relentless antagonistic bully to me, and the only thing that made me feel better was playing bass guitar in the jazz band class. or it was, until our band teacher left. the replacement - mrs. rath - was just terrible. i think she tried, but she was not good. my bully ran that class and rath encouraged it. my bass guitar skills ""weren't good enough"" so i ended up being banished to play triangle and jingle bells. it's a small miracle i didn't kill myself throughout that year, because lord knows i wanted to. i'll never forget the day she asked us our opinions on a specific piece we were playing (which was objectively horrible). she called on me and i said that i didn't like it. she then yelled at me for being negative and ""being the worst member of the band"" until i cried (fortunately, that was not long). she made me play songs faster and harder until i permanently scarred the tendons in both of my wrists, and whenever my bully decided to lash out at me, mrs. rath would watch and laugh. so yeah kathy, fuck you. i'm glad you got banished to elementary school teaching. i hope i never see you again. step on legos for the rest of your life. edit: i made this name up. i apologize, i didn't realize there was an actual kathy rath. please leave that individual alone, i don't know them"	3564	23473	bu766u	ep8j7ig

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"in high school i was maybe 6ft in grade 11. i was a varsity wrestler. a kid who was in grade 10, 5ft maybe, was a massive bully to everyone and used his size as a defensive mechanism from retaliation. one day i was eating lunch at a picnic table alone and he came behind me and started choking me. i stood up, pulled him over my shoulders and set him on the ground gently knowing there was staff all around. the asst principal saw this and gave me a suspension for 3 days and tried convincing the parents of the bully to press charges on me for beating on the smaller kids. thankfully the dad knew his kid was a punk (i'm assuming) stood up for me with the ""boy's will be boy's"" line. i'm sure he knew the assistant was full of crap. traumatic in the sense i thought i would be punished for being a victim. my mom grounded me for a week. my dad brought me home my favorite burger joint dinner every night and said ""proud of you for not being violent to troubled people."	414	23473	bu766u	ep8v17r
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in grade one i had the worst teacher. theres a few times it was really bad. one time i went out for lunch with my grandparents who were in town visiting. after we ate, my grandma took me to a store. she bought me new coloured pencils ( i was obsessed with drawing and colouring). so she drops me off at school and i'm late. i'm not sure how long (i was 6/7) but all the kids in my class had gone to gym. i put my new pencils in my desk but quickly opened them to look before i left. my teacher came in the class and started yelling at me for being late. i didn't know and she didn't realize but my grandma had followed me and was actually in the hall listening. so my grandma comes in and starts getting mad at her. i cant remember what was said but it was upsetting and i was bawling by this point. my grandma told me to get my stuff and took me out of school for the rest of the day. that woman was horrible and should have never been allowed around young kids.	112	23473	bu766u	ep8uhrf
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"i have social anxiety, and was nervous about having to play a song that ""described my life"" for my high school senior english class. my teacher grabbed a cape and like a hat or something from a closet then stood on my desk and danced around while announcing to the class i was nervous and she was trying to show me there was nothing to be nervous about. called a whole lot of attention to me and my anxiety in such a weird way. probably sounds stupid to most people but i did not appreciate that at all totally did the opposite of calming my nerves."	1218	23473	bu766u	ep8jtu2
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my 4th grade teacher was friends with this 5th grade teacher in my elementary and one day i misbehaved and my 4th grade teacher kept me inside for recess, then i met the 5th grade teacher that day and he said he was gunna keep me and my friend in every day when we go to 5th grade and he sure as shit did and he made us do squats while playing welcome to the jungle througj the whole song, to this day i have flashbacks when i hear axel on mainstream radio	452	23473	bu766u	ep8etzn
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my teacher called me out in front of the whole class saying i had adhd after being diagnosed and asked if i took my meds today for everyone to hear. this was before adhd was just a big joke that everyone had. she got teacher of the year award that year even though she was mean as hell. i finally got a good grade on a test one time and she accused me of cheating also.	601	23473	bu766u	ep8d44b
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	listening to my health teacher explain that all gay people were child molesters. (i was openly gay.)	1398	23473	bu766u	ep8a979
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	one school i went to was awful. i had a teacher who yelled at me regularly. one of the worst ones was when i didn't have a worksheet (which i knew was in my locker) so she freaked out about my messy desk, pulled it into the hallway and dumped it on the floor. the gym teacher was equally as bad if not worse. this school was very athletic and students' treatment was based on athletic ability. i am not at all athletic, never have been. we had to run around the football field and baseball diamond at the start of every gym class. if you slowed down, even to catch your breath, you had to go around again. i spent many gym classes just walking the field because i can't run that far so why bother. honestly there is so much more, that school really messed me up.	690	23473	bu766u	ep803vk
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i brought chips to class. she got angry and grabbed it away from me and shouted like crazy. for a primary school kid like me, that was traumatic.	309	23473	bu766u	ep8b0nr
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my 4th grade teacher played a game in math class where wed have to write the answer to the problem on a whiteboard, hold it up, and if you got it wrong, youd have to do a consequence (dance, sing, anything embarrassing). i struggled with the math we were learning, so i was always getting questions wrong with a few other students and i hated the game. it only made me hate math more and i fell further and further behind. i thought i was just terrible at math until i finally got a great teacher sophomore year.	309	23473	bu766u	ep8dqng
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in grade school my teacher had me and two other students stay back during recess so another teacher could come in, drag our desks into the hall, tip them over and rifle through everything. i was so confused as to why this was happening and why that teacher was so maniacal. in the end we got to put our desks back and my teacher told me that someone stole the other teachers candy bars earlier that morning and they thought it was us because she put her bag down in the hall next to us when we were waiting to go to our first class. low and behold that teacher found her candy bars and rewarded each of us with one candy bar. to write this and think back on it, its so weird and a bit scarring.	85	23473	bu766u	ep8e4js
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in 2nd or 3rd grade i had a sub one day and there was a math question that was 300+2+60 we just had to add the numbers together, easy right? i added them together and obviously got 362, but this dumbass said that it was 326 because of the placement of the numbers in the question. she then proceeded to bring me too the front of the class and say i was dumb and didnt deserve friends because i was too retarded to do math. she got fired two days later.	401	23473	bu766u	ep8n1qe
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my math teacher used to use me as a bad example for other students, and he used to constantly remind me that i am terrible in math and would never succeed in life. this still gets to me sometimes, but it has been a couple of years now since the last time i've seen him. oh well.	155	23473	bu766u	ep8io5i
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a pre-k - 4th grade chorus teacher. lets call her mrs. c. (by the way, chorus in my school wasnt optional, you had to take it for those years.) she was honestly the most rude bossy person i had ever met, but the traumatic experience happened when i was in either 2nd or 3rd grade. it didnt exactly happen to me but the way she reacted terrified me. basically every year lower school all together do a performance together to honor people in the military/retired military. anyways we were in a rehearsal and we were standing on those bleachers. these were high bleachers. there was a kid on the top row who was fiddling around while we were practicing. there was a loose bar protecting the top row. he accidentally bumped into it, and the row fell. he fell off and hit his head, he started bleeding and everyone started screaming. we were evacuated into the mpr (multi purpose room,) where the teachers basically just brought them back to their class. mrs. c. was there and told us, it doesnt matter he hit his head. hes so dumb anyways. i. literally. barfed. theres no way she, a teacher who is supposed to be nice, just brushed this kids pain off, and it doesnt matter. i still the teacher in the hallways, and she gives me chills everyday. i also used to take piano lessons with her, but thats a story for another day.	283	23473	bu766u	ep86ifr
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	not exactly traumatic, but i honestly had urges to just get up and leave. the teacher was ridiculously hypocritical and obnoxious. every day when we came in she would criticize us about our life choices and then talk all about her life. then during exams (including the final we had), she cracked down on us talking, yet during the whole test she would spill her guts out. it wasnt even a small whisper like most teachers do while talking during a test, she was nearly yelling.	276	23473	bu766u	ep8igly
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i pissed my pants in 7th grade because i was so terrified to ask my science teacher to go to the restroom. luckily the bell rang shortly after and none of my fellow classmates knew. but i can remember later that year she brought up how she had made two kids piss their pants, as if she took pride in the fact that she terrified her students.	71	23473	bu766u	ep8xj29
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	this professor giving a pointless class in college. my phone accidentally rang because i was waiting for a medical call, i interrupted him because of that. i apologized and said sorry, the asshole said sorry for your parents that pay your college fee, theyre wasting money. loud to everyone in the clase i had a huge urge to punch him but remained silent because i was changing career that semester and would not see him for another course anyway. he always got away with humiliating students with those types of comments for petty shit, everyone hated that asshole.	911	23473	bu766u	ep899a9
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"my overweight band teacher closed the door to his office and yelled at me for forty minutes straight because i asked if i could miss a weekend event as ""waterboy"" to attend my best friend's birthday. fuck you mike."	334	23473	bu766u	ep8dhoh
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"i was pretty sick with an eating disorder in high school and consequently had to stop taking gym classes. the gym teacher cornered me in the hallway and said, ""so how long is this going to be a thing?"" to which i replied that i didn't know but i would be out of the class for at least a semester. his response was something along the lines of, ""i thought it would only take you a week or two/ i didn't think it would take you that long."" looking back on it i hope maybe i educated him a bit on the subject so if another student is in the same situation he can act with a bit more compassion."	132	23473	bu766u	ep8i9ox
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"when i was in 4th grade, i passed a note to a girl i liked. it was a super tame note, just said something like ""i think you're cute, will you be my girlfriend?"" typical 4th grader stuff, really. teacher saw me trying to pass the note and intercepted it before it reached the girl. she read it (not aloud) and pulled me into the hallway. she said what i was doing was wrong, and that it was sexual harassment. she said it's the sort of thing men go to jail for. she kept saying ""sexual harassment"" over and over in that little talk. i barely even understood what sexual harassment even was, but i knew it was bad. made me feel like such a creep, like a predator. made me cry from embarrassment and fear of going to jail. after i was done crying, she let me go back into the classroom. gotta admit, that really fucked up my view of women for a while. made me think of girls as scary and unapproachable. took me a while to break out of that, too."	61	23473	bu766u	ep8zkc4
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"when i was 11 years old, i spent a lot of time playing outdoors, mah complexion went from wheatish to dark, and also i had like really curly hair and decided to grow it out, school reopens and my class teacher was like ""go cut your hair i don't want negros in my class"" -_-"	114	23473	bu766u	ep8vdb0
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"my teacher asked what problems we had on the homework. i immediately yelled ""2-24"" which were the actual problems we had to do for the homework. what he actually meant was what we found difficult about the homework. he looked me dead in the eyes and said ""oh. you. fuckin. smart ass."" with the straightest face. i was genuinely confused and kind of scared."	205	23473	bu766u	ep8r5op
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i never made a connection with any of my teachers except for one. it was the 5th grade and i got bullied a lot. no one seemed to care except for my english teacher mr. coleman. he gave me a job after class sorting books and stuff so that i didn't have to take the bus. i loved to read so he would give me books meant for some of the older grades that he thought i'd enjoy. we grew close, and the most traumatic day i ever had was when he announced that he'd be leaving at the end of the year. i felt devastated that my only friend and mentor would be gone. i ran into the bathroom crying and there were a bunch of other kids in there so they watched me pee.	426	23473	bu766u	ep892fl
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in second grade at the end of school one day, a few of us were up getting our backpacks on earlier than the announcement and my teacher (ms. grayson from hm pearson) decides to pull on the back of mine and another kids backpack handle in an attempt to aggressively get us back to our seats, but instead we tumble to the ground on our backs. we both went to the principal after that but nothing ever happened to her	310	23473	bu766u	ep85rxg
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	when i was placed at a desk that was walled off from the rest of the class. i could only see the blackboard and had to do group activities alone. i was told i was a problematic student and constantly lectured and told i was a bad kid, but i actually had undiagnosed adhd - inattentive type. once diagnosed and medicated, i had a solid 4.0 and always made dean's list and president's list every semester.	49	23473	bu766u	ep8ufsf
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	the gym teacher i had in elementary school was an absolutely awful guy. on my first day of kindergarten i was wearing a dress with strings that tied in the back and i was chewing on them because i was anxious. he called me out and said i was a baby in front of the whole class. it was my first ever day of school, i hadnt even turned 5 yet. what a fucking prick. he also used to tell us we were going to die before our parents because my generation is fat and lazy. a super cool thing to tell a bunch of kids	54	23473	bu766u	ep8uq3j
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a professor for one of my theorized math courses that was a complete dick. there are three, specific experiences. background info: the class had no textbook, and we had only whatever he wrote on the board in lecture. even when it came to maple, which we were, apparently, required to know, even though in this course description it said intro to maple. 1. the homework was actually impossible, and we had quizzes on it, randomly. one time we had a pop quiz where the homework required for it was just undoable, because it was not related to lectures and not google-able. (senior-level, theorized, math courses) after the quiz, he asked, was there any questions on the homework/ quiz, so i raised my hand and asked, why do we have quizzes on things we dont cover, considering we dont have a textbook? (i was pretty mad at this point) his response was, i refuse to answer unless you rephrase the question to make it sound like it wasnt my fault, because its your fault for not understanding the material. i almost walked out of the classroom, but i knew that i couldnt ever miss anything, because he also didnt post his lecture notes anywhere. 2. one time, he told us of an upcoming quiz, and it was to basically figure out a proof about some theory that literally took 700 years for mathematicians to figure out; we had 4 days. i just didnt even show up to class. 3. this one irked me the most. i went to his office hours, and i apologized for making it seem like my question was his faultit was more of an actual question and not meant to have the intent of an attack on him; im a very blunt person. i asked if there was literally anywhere online or tutor wise in which i could get extra help. he told me that there was no textbook and that his lectures were all i needed. i was like ok, but clearly this stuff isnt working for me; you dont have any back-up plans for students that cant understand easily? (keep in mind, again, his lectures had almost nothing to do with the homework assignments, which stopped about halfway through the semester, so there was actually no way in teaching yourself this stuff.) he told me that he would not help me and to just study his lectures harder, so i left. overall, one of the worst professors, and humans, i have ever met. i can not believe someone of that manner and caliber was allowed to be a professor and was actual credible. i somehow got a c, and i surely dont know how anyone got an a. the classs grades were like 35% a, literally 1 b, 50% c, and the rest were below c.	51	23473	bu766u	ep906wy

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in third grade i had a teacher tie me up to my chair and tape my mouth shut. i was a super smart and hyper kid who had just been prescribed prednisone for my asthma. which will make you crawl out of your skin. my original teacher died in the beginning of the year and we had 4 temps before ms keeney. she was 25 no degree and should not have been teaching. she screamed goddammit punkrockid and tied me up. i then wouldnt shut the fuck up so she taped my mouth shut. 28 kids laughed at me, one kid drew scissors from his desk and motioned to cut the chord. i remember making eye contact with sean and shook my head no. told my parents got switched out of the class and the teacher was fired. the other kids parents in the class threw the teacher a going away party because that kid and his brothers were always trouble other than my 3rd grade class ive told maybe 3 people about that. as ive gotten older it explains so much of some things in my life edit for spelling	256	23473	bu766u	ep8cbl5
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i got picked up by my third grade teacher and held against the wall by the scruff of my shirt and yelled at for about 20 minutes. totally deserved it. i'm surprised she could hold me that long. i was a chubby kid.	197	23473	bu766u	ep8elpy
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	not particularly traumatic (the first one, anyway), but i have two stories i'd like to share: the first is of a teacher in my secondary school who screwed over a lot of students' it gcses. she wasn't the worst teacher, she was actually very likeable. she, however, decided that instead of teaching the unit like she was supposed to, she'd just do the work at the front of the class and have all of us copy as she went. obviously this meant that everyone's work looked near identical to each other's. needless to say, her superiors found out and she was fired. oh, she also allegedly slept with a student at a prom a few years prior. the second story is a tad more personal, i'll keep it brief. i ended up having a thing for one of the teachers in my second year of college (i know, thin ice). i had a very positive relationship with her and even liked her enough to consider her a close friend, and i feel as though she held a similar sentiment toward me. i was never able to express myself properly when face to face with her (one time i tried to thank her for being so supportive and friendly to me and i accidentally thanked her for being 'pretty cool' instead, which she teased me for). so, near the end of the year she tells me of her plans to leave the country. she's going to sri lanka to teach kids english (it's all very noble). i learned of these plans in 2018, come easter 2019 and, well, we all know what happened in that country. i have never feared for someone's life before and, bearing in mind i hadn't (and still don't have) a way to contact her i was scared shitless of the possibility of something happening. thankfully i have no reason to believe anything bad happened to her due to monitoring the number of posts on one of her social accounts (a little stalkerish but i needed to know), but that shit fucks with you, especially when you don't expect it. edit: just added a sentence in parentheses	87	23473	bu766u	ep8ebi4
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in our school the football coach wanted me to play on the team, so in order to get me to play, he publicly embarrassed me for an entire class period, saying such things that i was a coward and had a yellow streak down my back. his angry ranting went on for an hour with the class sitting in stunned silence. he also stood in the doorway to prevent me from leaving the room. after that experience i had great difficulty with public speaking for years. i learned for the first time that monsters can be real. thankfully, he is now deceased from natural causes.	39	23473	bu766u	ep8kf3x
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i had a math teacher who was also the track coach. one day during practice she was assigning people to events during an upcoming track meet. kids were saying what event they wanted to participate in and shed write their name/event on an index card then put it in her folder. well she left her folder open and you could clearly see that on the back of each index card shed written either fast or slow. a lot of kids were upset to see that they were considered slow and a bunch left the team after that because they felt bad about their efforts. the worst part is this was middle school and the stakes clearly werent that high, so she essential ruined it for us for no reason.	44	23473	bu766u	ep8r3qj
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"in 9th grade, i had this family education teacher she one of those women who didn't take bullshit from anybody, and would scream at everybody for everything, one day she became really fixated on me. i was just bored poking a mechanical person because i didn't have anything to do and the class was ending in just a few minutes. well for some reason that pissed her off and she started screaming at me about how annoying it was. the teacher got so worked up over it that she anciently made her printer print over 100 pages, and it wouldn't cancel. i could her tell me ""oh you're going to get it now"" but the bell rang and i sneak out of the class and went to my 7th-period class."	38	23473	bu766u	ep8df3s
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	if i remembered correctly i believe i was in second grade, the teacher asked the class a question i went & answered it. i was completely wrong, instead of her correcting me & helping me. she made the whole class laugh at me. then from there on fourth i've never raised my hand in class & refused to ask questions in class.	36	23473	bu766u	ep8r7jk
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	when i was 14 years old i was accepted into an arts magnet school. it was a pretty big deal in the city that i grew up in. prestigious artists came in to teach young students that displayed promise, i guess. i was accepted into a creative writing department, one of only four freshmen to be accepted. it was the biggest deal of my life. within a few weeks this semi-famous and important 55 year old man began molesting me. in front of his classroom. in front of everyone. he didn't even bother trying to hide it. i was young and stupid and for awhile i thought that the attention meant i was special, and when i quickly realized how awful it was i felt like i couldn't do anything because everyone saw it and no one was stopping it. he made me believe, as a freshman, a 14 year old child, that men sexually touching a young girl in front of her peers was totally normal. so i stayed quiet for four months. my fingernails fell out. i began having intense panic attacks. i finally spoke out and he lost his job and the school attorneys advised my parents not to open up a legal investigation because they said it would further traumatize me. when i initially came forward the director of the school refused to listen to me. it was a nightmare. when i graduated school i moved out of the city and he found out where i lived and began stalking me. he ended up kidnapping me and taking me back to his home studio and showed me a shrine he made of me. he continued stalking me until my friend's weed dealer called him and threatened to murder him on his front lawn. it all stopped. i tried to move forward but it took seventeen years of suffering to finally go to the press. it was a complete fucking nightmare. i came out with my story a year ago and i am just beginning to get better. i'm going to college for the first time and i'm getting my life back on track. i haven't written anything substantial in the last 17 years because of his except some fan fiction because it's too painful and i'm still afraid to tap into those emotions.	103	23473	bu766u	ep8y6fz
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	kindergarten- older teacher was cruel to me, as a child i didn't understand this, wouldn't let me use the bathroom or the drinking fountain, discouraged other kids from playing with me. 1st grade, middle aged woman never let me go to recess, encouraged the other kids to bully me, and punished me when another kid would bully me, refused to teach me directly told me i wasn't capable of learning anyway. it's real fucking confusing growing up not white in a white community that hates anyone who isn't white. anyway, they built a new school across town and every parent with ''problem'' children moved them to it, and all the teachers were young transplants hired from universities out by the coast, never had a teacher treat me like that again. had some stupid comments from one teacher in high school, but he wasn't racist or hateful, he was actually very nice, just a bit ignorant, but really nice, never treated me differently in any measurable way.	133	23473	bu766u	ep8abc8
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	my last year math teacher i really connected with, and he was super helpful and probably one of my favourites. this year he was apparently suspended for some inappropriate comment about a girl at our school or sexual harassment? it was months ago and ive only heard rumours, and i think about it a lot. i just wish i knew the truth.	98	23473	bu766u	ep8626t
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	this didn't happen to me but we once had a teacher in my old middle school that came in drunk and made sexual comments about the students in his grade 6 class, he later asked one his female students to stay after class and proceeded to forcibly makeout with her and even tried to push her onto his couch, she immediately ran crying to the school office. he was 36 and the girl was 12. it's sick what some people can do.	62	23473	bu766u	ep8jxvd

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	back in kindergarten, we did this thing on thanksgivings that you switch classrooms with other students and i was one to switch. it is worth mentioning that i had a cough because it was the time of year when it gets cold and people get a little sickly. while the teacher was reading i would cough every now and then, but she at one point snapped and yelled at me. she threaten to give me a referral if i coughed again. i then spent the entire rest of the day holding in coughs and being miserable. i am 20 now but still remember this story.	32	23473	bu766u	ep8qdsq
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	we were doing craft in about year 3. at my school, everyone had to bring in their own craft supplies. the teacher borrowed my scissors (had totally normal full sized ones, while most of the other kids had childs ones). well, the teacher cut her finger badly, did some real damage, blood everywhere, and had to go to the hospital. on the way out she was screaming in pain and yelling that its my parents fault for sending me to school with such dangerous scissors. i felt so terrible!	34	23473	bu766u	ep8r8ki

what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	in 4th grade, i prepared valentine's day card for all the kids in my class. when i was ready to give them out to everyone (unfortunately during class) my teacher reprimanded me for being disruptive, knocked all my cards on the ground, and told me to pick them up.	23	23473	bu766u	ep8xqlc
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i will be hosting a waynes world viewing party in the math departments meeting room. all are invited not really traumatic. more extremely uncomfortable. first some background, this professor is actually a very nice person, just extremely awkward. he shows his class memes from 2012. anyway, i was a college freshmen eager to earn some brownie points, so i decided id go watch waynes world. id actually seen it before with my dad. my roommate came along just incase i was the only one to show up. we ended up being the only people to show up. he had a bunch of snacks on the table that went on. probably fewer than 50 words were exchanged and my friend an i wee texting each other that we should find an excuse to leave, but we didnt end up leaving. there were snacks on the table that went unopened through the entire movie. i ended up getting an a in the class, so i suppose it was worth it. i did continue to have some odd encounters with this professor though. dr. s, if your reading this, party on.	25	23473	bu766u	ep97hv1
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	i moved to a new school in 2nd grade, i was shy about singing in music class and basically didn't at all, or do the little hand motions or whatever. she would single me out and embarrass me in front of the class every class, but i did and still do like music, and i participated in the non-singing parts of the class. it came to a head in 5th grade and i was allowed not to go to music class at the very end of elementary school. by this point i was already playing in orchestra with a different teacher who came to the school only for orchestra, and i continued playing through high school cuz music is fun.	24	23473	bu766u	ep8iwbl
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	"i auditioned for the school talent show and performed a (shit) song, but the teacher who was judging the auditions was so fucking mean, i think she fancied herself as an x factor judge. she absolutely destroyed me, i wasn't expecting it at all. she also later told one of my little sisters who also attended the school that people like her and her family were the reason the school was failing (because my single parent mum hadn't been able to afford the 150 per child per term ""voluntary"" donation). she became principle and from that point on used to walk around the school with a floor-length real fur coat, i shit you not."	22	23473	bu766u	ep8y14r
what is your most traumatic experience with a teacher?	didnt happen to me but it still makes my blood boil. small town, one of my classmates in grade 10 english was dating the teachers best-friends daughter. he was a decent kid, well liked, he just had troubles in school and was a bit hyperactive. well, an untrue rumour had started earlier in the day that he had cheated on his girlfriend. by our block in the afternoon in grade 10 the rumour had been cleared up. apparently it was started in spite by a previous friend of the guy. anyways, apparently the teacher hadnt received the news just the content of the rumour. class starts and the teacher (who is a known bully) starts off by saying today you are going to hear a special piece of literature in order to comprehend the importance of spelling and grammar. immediately the hairs stand on up on the back of my neck. i was a shy kid and raised to do our best at respecting our elders but my mom was one to root for the underdog. i had this feeling, i just knew what she was planning to do, she was going for the jugular. and it didnt feel right. i stood up (kind of stunned with myself) and yelled you better stop this bullshit. picture the quietest easily bullied kid in your class saying it. the rest of the class didnt comprehended my intent and i froze or maybe they just wanted to witness the drama. anyways, i got a few shut the fuckups from classmates and the teacher chirps in yes please do, are you crazy? i look directly into the guys eyes and he mouths its okay. and i mouth im sorry. still frozen with tears in my eyes. in high sight i should have just ran to the office but i was scared. the teacher then proceeds to read out a very personal letter that she says is written by a guy to his girlfriend. it includes details about how the author was sexual abused by his step-father at 14 and the confusing feelings he had about the situation and thoughts of suicide. (this is the 1990s and sexual abuse wasnt well understood and the victim would sometimes be shamed for apparently wanting it. yes, i lived in the sticks.) she also intentionally stumbled at every grammatical and spelling error. she then turns to the guy and says see if you wanted to confess your feelings to your girlfriend, you should have edited first. the class bursts out laughing. the guy is just emotionally stunned. i didnt know how it impacted him and was too shy to even ask. and it just wasnt ever discussed. that kind of bullying was so normalized. and i stupidly worried id be in trouble too for failing him and worried nobody would believe me. and afraid id be bullied more. luckily the rumour mill didnt fly. he had good friends i guess. but, some kids would always tease him and say daddy wants a bj. years later drunk at our high school reunion he came up and asked if i could chat. he then proceeds to thank me for my kindness and apologize for never standing up for me. i said but i failed you. he said you didnt, you tried. he said that it was discovered the girlfriend had given the letter to her mom out of fear for his safety. and the teacher had taken it from her best friend (this lady was a bully to everyone). the teacher had since past away from cancer. to this day i sometimes wake up screaming stop stop you bitch. nobody will probably ever read this but glad i got it out. thanks for askreddit, it can be quite therapeutic.	23	23473	bu766u	ep9fmj2

"there was a beautiful pristine waterfall near where i used to camp during the summer. we could go and enjoy hours playing in it in absolute isolation, and we knew enough to be careful not to stress the landscape too much. now, you can't go there without the hoards of ugly people with their screaming children and barking dogs that monopolize the water, eroding the banks and destroying the surrounding flora. they leave behind their dog shit and litter, including baby diapers and beer cans that are often seen bobbing around in what was once a crystal clear pool. i hate those people. edit: just to clarify, my description of these people as ""ugly"" is a reference more to their behaviour and attitude than their external looks. second edit: in response to all the people who asked me why i thought this beautiful spot only belonged to me: i didn't. in fact, i knew that other people were enjoying the falls but they did it with more respect and there were fewer of them. the question was ""what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?"" - i answered that question with an anecdote from my own experience."	9326	39824	blf1l9	emnxtn0

what has been ruined because too many people are doing it?	my town. i've lived here for a few decades, and we used to be a relatively small area. we were the shopping center for the area (mall and a few department stores), so we were a little busy, but nothing too bad. really, it was nice being close to shit that we needed, but far enough away that everything was quiet. then, developers started cramming subdivisions into every open area they could. it's especially bad for me, because most of them are being added onto the two lane road that i leave my neighborhood on. when i was in elementary school, there was almost no traffic leaving my neighborhood in the morning. by the time i could drive, i had to find another route to go, because the exit to my neighborhood was backed up 1/4 mile every morning when i left. plus, my neighborhood was surrounded by woods, and now it's ugly as shit because they're just clearing it all for more houses. then, industry started moving in. amazon came in and bought up a bunch of warehouses. then, they started building more. it takes me forever to get to work in the winter, because they have to have cops manually do the traffic lights so amazon employees don't grind it to a halt. they also just cleared a shit ton of forest area to build a few more amazon warehouses, right next to where they cleared even more for more factories/warehouses. the traffic here is so fucking bad. i used to never really plan on hitting any, but now it's just a constant standstill everywhere. i have to tack on an extra 5-10 minutes to get to work. an extra 5-10 minutes to go to the store. coming back from class, an extra 15 minutes if i leave too late. plus, they're expanding some roads that will realistically only make things worse, so my whole area looks completely naked, because you can see stuff over a mile away now. i'm leaving the area as soon as i can. this place is just too ugly and congested.	386	39824	blf1l9	emoyng1

what are some really really weird subreddits?	"/r/fedlegs it is a subreddit dedicated to the fetish (of one man? [/u/jimthefeeder](https://www.reddit.com/u/jimthefeeder)) of women with their legs painted yellow. not the torso, not the feet, just the legs, and specifically the color yellow. it is named fedlegs because the fictional process for getting their legs yellowed is known as ""feeding the legs"" all in all, a very benign fetish, but the lore of the creator is what i think makes this a real contender. below are the highlights from the [stickied post on the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/fedlegs/comments/8xzk6a/fedleg_explanation_updated_due_to_expanding/) detailing his creation, implementation, and outcome of the ""leg feeding procedure"", along with the dr. fedleg universe, which is a parallel universe to our own.  wondered if it was possible to create a fetish from scratch. based on what i've read it's a mix of: light bondage, leggings, orgasm denial, and ownership/marking in the vein of the scarlet letter (i assume that's a fetish, i don't know if there's an exact term for it.)  he has an detailed universe of how the system works. who/why people get ""fedlegged"". mostly based on the kind of clothing they wear. if they've got their legs visible to be seen, they're getting ""fedlegged"".  in universe, everyone is aware of doctor fedleg, (full name charles fed ostrog), the person who got the process of leg painting legalized; he has the government's support. he developed sustainable clean/renewable energy which is why he's successful.  he never wishes to see women injured/beat/hurt during the process.  ""his reasoning is a mystery, but the one thing for certain is that it has nothing to do with religion."" - actual line in the writing.  on the 2014 midterm elections, prosecution for dr. fedleg was added onto the ballot; people voted against prosecuting him due to his successful ocean clean up act.  dr. fedleg has various kinds of paints that last certain durations. he also has a blend of the paint that can stop excessively revealing women, slutty, or rude women from having orgasms. dr. fedleg is the only person with permission to apply this special paint. regardless, i find the whole thing fascinating. what led to creation of the character? why create this universe to have it all work? why does dr. fedleg care about the environment so much? is it to be relatable to other people that might stumble across this, or is it the author inserting his own beliefs into the lore? why did he choose the 2014 midterm election? the post was written in july of 2018, so the closest upcoming midterm election would have been 4 months away, but he instead chose to go back to 2014, which i think would indicate he's been thinking about this for a while. in general i just have a lot of questions."	12022	49255	bovsdb	enm6ume

gamers of reddit: what video game are you currently playing?	currently re-playing persona 5. its an interesting experience playing it the second time around. i skip most of the dialogue, im far more efficient with leveling social stats and confidants, im far better at combat and the like, i just generally have my shit together. it got to the point where i decided to make the ulitimate nigh-unkillable yoshitsune just for fun (null or repels every element except fire, which its resistant to, and gunfire, which is rare). its stupidly expensive to make, but im now willing to grind for an hour or so after finishing a palace in order to fuse the necessary ingredient personas. ive currently saved up 1.5 million yen and am just waiting to max out the magician confidant so i can make futsunuji(?) which is the last one i need before i can start the final fusion process. it took an absurd amount of effort to accomplish and will make the rest of the game (and new game +, probably) trivial, but damn if it isnt satisfying to see the pieces come together.	78	20186	bk8ypo	emf37ud

blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	"might be too late but why not? legally blind, vision deteriorating throughout my life, got the ""legal"" designation in my early 20s. dating's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but there are a few things that help me appreciate someone intimately: 1. they don't spend the majority of the first date as a ""performance audit"" of how my vision might interfere with dating. it puts me on the defensive since i get half of those questions rephrased during job interviews and medical appointments. we met via [eharmony.com](https://eharmony.com/), not [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov/) =p 2. if they communicate about things openly but know what information isn't important at the moment. if someone goes ""radio silent"" in bed, i have no idea if i'm boring them, if they're unconscious, if they're having doubts about consent, or if i'm missing their favorite spot, and doubt is a hell of a mood-killer. however, if they're saying things like ""a little lower"" or ""don't you dare stop"", you better believe they have my undivided attention! 3. similarly, if time permits, foreplay is often an overlooked form of intimacy. not only is it arousing, but i'm also getting ""the lay of the land"" in the same way i'd use a cane if walking down the street. so yeah, quickies don't always work out if i'm trying to learn the layout of someone who wants to be gone in 10 minutes. don't rush it! 4. not gonna lie: breasts. i might not be able to notice them from afar, but if i'm with someone who's comfortable enough around me, they're my favorite kind of braille. \^\_- i'm open to chat for a while; if there're other questions. otherwise, i hope this helps! edit: my most upvoted comment is now about my sex life. fml. no, seriously, please do. i'm very lonely. i'll settle for a cuddle, at this rate. edit2: and now my first gold! thanks, newly-informed stranger! edit3: as well as platinum! one moment while i curl up in the corner and gibber quietly."	6867	44511	bljq8j	emppqcv

blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	26f here. i am legally blind so i don't know how much my answer counts since i still have some vision (completely blind in my right eye and with glasses i have 20/200 in my left. no clue what it is without glasses), but i will happily give my $0.02. i do have physical things i like (beard, glasses) but i loooove guys with low voices. i also am very aware of how people smell. other than that, it is typical things that both sighted and blind people could say: passion for life, someone who inspires me to be better and get out in the world and challenge myself, someone with a compatible sense of humor to mine. most importantly, someone who is kind and warm. also a dog lover. i have a guide dog. :d	215	44511	bljq8j	emq12q0
blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	not blind but lived with a blind housemate for 7 years who was bi and kinky as fuck. we're still friends and hang out. most blind people have some degree of sight, she can see screens close up with magnifying software and enjoys watching what she can make out in burlesque videos. we been to a couple of burlesque shows together, she couldnt see shit but she did enjoy dressing up in corsets and stockings for them. she occasionally goes to a fetish night (which is incidently ran by a partially sighted woman! no, it's not a fetish night for blind people, just a coincidence) and my partner has made her costumes for them in the past. i'm guessing the costumes are appealing to her because of the sensation of the fabric or corsetting. she also told me she enjoyed electro sex and flogging when she's doing kink play, as a range of sensations are important to her. we're both sex positive and talk open about sex quite a bit actually. she gets up to some savage stuff, but none of it seems to have much to do with being blind just being a kinky mofo. honestly her kinkiness aside, from what shes told me, her sex life seems pretty much the same as any other bisexual persons i've heard, which is unsurprising as most people have vanilla sex in the dark anyway. i've noticed she is more in tune with sensual rather than visual stuff, like she talks about men and womens builds a lot, prefering lithe people with slender delicate limbs and hands. i guess touch or imagining being touched is more exciting when you can't see where it's coming from so a penchant for delicate hands makes sense. she's a lot of fun and a very happy, positive person. i deeply admire she never lets her blindness prevent her from enjoying things to the max. i've certainly never heard her complain about her blindness. edit: thankyou for the gold!	699	44511	bljq8j	empofjm
blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	favorite features are being tall with a big ass and thick thighs. bad breath is a deal breaker given my height and sense of smell and no crustaceans should be on the body at all. super obsessive over smooth skin after i was traumatized with getting with this truck stop chick who had the worst case of eczema i have ever felt in my entire life. so in a sense i would say smells in texture come first and then physical preferences come second.	2251	44511	bljq8j	empd5dz

blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	"real answer, since there are only two damn answers that people are posting, and both are retarded. i have worked with blind people before. gone to school with blind people and done volunteer work with blind people. and i have asked this to several and seen dozens of blind people get asked this. generally, the answer i got was ""voice"" and just ""their attitude"", like are they energetic, bubbly, all cutey, etc. most seeing people are sexually attracted by looking at someome, since it is an easy one sided thing to do. blind people can do the same by over hearing someone talk. they also have have preferences, like ""big tits"" or ""small body"" or ""hairy chest"" or whatever, just like sighted people. but since they can't just see the body, they do not know of them until they get to know the person and find out, or directly ask."	22	44511	bljq8j	emqbhpz

blind people of reddit, what do you find sexually attractive?	i've (m) been totally blind for most of my life (24 now) and i'll try to answer this question. &#x200b; a couple of crossposts from /r/askblindpeople. &#x200b; the sound of their voice particularly when they are enthusiastic or laughing about something, the smell of their perfume/cologne/shampoo, the curves and musculature of their body when your close to them such as when hugging or brushing up against them by accident, basically all of the other non visual cues you already know but almost magnified. it's not super easy, but it does help you become less shallow i suppose. being attracted to personality over looks. though i've met many people with nice voices who i was later told were unattractive so that's not really a good indicator. often, if a woman is wearing heels or has a certain flirtyness or confidence about her, or if i've heard her talking about wearing sexier clothes i can assume she's probably at least decent looking. and what others say can of course be an indicator as well, but it's really never foolproof. i've never personally been close enough to someone romantically to feel comfortable asking to touch their face, and honestly even if i did, i don't know if i'd be able to get much out of it without having touched others to compare. yeah i know what poems and books consider attractive in a human face, but that's only a loose guideline, and doesn't really take into account things like laugh lines, facial expressions, and eye contact. i would probably ask someone i trusted and knew could communicate it properly, then try to get a second opinion. &#x200b; \-------------------------------------------------- &#x200b; as for porn and stuff, there are a few audio porn sites, but they aren't that popular among blind people because the narration usually isn't that great and it takes you out of it. most of us read erotica or listen to regular porn that just has good audio quality, no music, and close up/louder stuff going on. &#x200b; if anyone wants to know more about any fassit of blindness, please check out the faq post on /r/blind and then feel free to ask me anything you want more clarification on here as best as i can.	35	44511	bljq8j	empq63l

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	the best treatment for a child with anxiety is treating their parents anxiety. edit: thanks for the awards, kind strangers! for those curious, i am a licensed mental health professional that specializes in children. i appreciate that some people noted that anxiety is a necessary a healthy reaction that all people experience, very true! worries help keep us safe and let us know when there is danger. its the worries that interfere with daily functioning that become an issue. i think of anxiety issues on a spectrum, on one end is a healthy dose and on the other is a diagnosable anxiety disorder. there are people all across that spectrum that would benefit from therapy and/or learning some adaptive strategies. as some have pointed out, a childs anxiety is not 100% a result of a parents anxiety. there are, of course, cases where a child develops anxiety due to other circumstances. however, in the majority of cases with anxiety in children, it can be treated by treating the parent. children look to their parents for guidance to learn about what is and isnt safe. they are sponges that are constantly learning how to react to different things they approach. one of the easiest examples to see this is when a child experiences a minor injury/scare, they will naturally look to a trusted adult to judge how they should react. if the adult gasps, comes running with their arms extended, making a worried face, the child learns that was bad and they should be upset/hurt/scared. if the parent was to smile, shrug, and say oh man! the child will likely brush it off and move on (unless they acquired an injury, of course). think about this on a bigger scale, if a child is consistently learning the world is a scary and dangerous place, there are threats everywhere, etc. they are being set-up for anxiety issues. same goes for specific phobias, many of these are directly taught to children by seeing their parents fear. nothing says to be afraid of something more than the person you rely on for your survival showing their own genuine fear. simply following up with children regarding a scary or uncomfortable experience can make a world of difference! if you can inform them of what made that specific experience dangerous or scary, that helps teach them what to look out for instead of generalizing that fear to any experience that involves the same factors. one common example is childrens fear of bugs. the children have never had a bad experience with bugs, but the fact their parent runs away screaming from them each time she has an encounter, is a pretty clear message to them that they are not safe to be around. nothing like the person you trust most in this world expressing panic to discourage you from even getting close to them, especially when she tried reinforces your anxious reactions by holding you and crying with you after you nearly escape death by a caterpillar!	12143	54062	bu1s5i	ep6uoy4

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	"in some museums, what you see on the shelves can be less than 10% of the whole collection. for example, the louvre has over 460,000 items in their collection, and only has space to display about 35,000 of those (roughly 7.6% of their total collection) due to limited physical space, and for aesthetic purposes, most items in museums stay back in storage and/or archives. plus, most items need to be maintained at certain temperatures, and light. if we can't meet those needs, it will never be allowed for public viewing, ever. there are most likely some of the most amazing, visually stunning pieces of artwork, that you or anyone will never get to see. bonus: accession and de-accession can also be a touchy area. just because it's ""old"", doesn't mean we're going to take it and add it to the collections and we try to be nice to people who are disappointed we won't take their precious family heirlooms. other times, it's easier just to say, ""yeah, we don't want that."" **edited:** for correct percentage of the louvre's collection (its lower than i thought!) **edited again:** for those who were asking, i have a ba in art history, and a masters in museum studies. i presently work as a digital preservation librarian in the archives & special collections of a university, and have worked in numerous museums/universities all over the world! its been quite a fulfilling job, i've handled artwork from michelangelo, rembrandt, warhol, pollock, picasso, and many more. ask away, and i'll answer if i can!"	23866	54062	bu1s5i	ep6a5h9
what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	all processors begin as top of the line and then may end up lower because they didn't make the threshold. explaining with an example. <edit> the following is only an example to make things a bit oversimplified and not the actual specs or the actual names. </edit> intel only tries to make i9 processors, let's say they have 16 cores, since the process of making these is hard only 20-30% have all cores working. next they see the amount processors with more than or equal to 8 cores, disable extra cores just to make sure only 8 cores work and ship them as i7. next 4,5,6 and 7 in all only 4 cores are left working and shipped as i5. 2&3 only 2 cores are left operating and all others are switched off, shipped as i3. hope that makes sense, also this was a hypothetical example, not all facts maybe accurate (they should be but just in case) also this is done to minimise wastage which in turn makes these things cheaper so it's a win win for all. also this isn't just done by intel, snapdragon amd all do it, so when you hear nvidia is unable to meet the supply of their top tier card, it's not because the didn't try hard enough, it is because they keep failing to reach the benchmarks they expect in their top tier cards and sell them as low tier, because the yeild is low. note: this is a very difficult process and checking for mistakes in each peice at 14nm is not possible (since verification is a destructive process) so if something is wrong generally a batch gets screwed. edit: thanks for the silver, my first silver. important edit: this is a bit oversimplified, low end processors are also made, but they require setting up an entire assembly line, and thus are only done if there is a high demand and a very high probability of significantly better yield. also cores are not just the only parts disabled.	4712	54062	bu1s5i	ep67n9t

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	former field as i'm still learning my current one, but auto glass is no joke. tons of your car's features are directly connected to your windshield. they're also a pretty important safety feature in your vehicle. unlike your side and rear windows, which are typically tempered glass (also, in part, for safety reasons), windshields are laminated which is why they crack instead of shattering unless something really drastic happens to it. also, because it's laminated, it can crack all the way from side to side and you're still safe. just not from johnny law because he might give you a ticket. for most makes, most of those new safety features like lane departure warning and forward collision alert are on sensors that work through the glass. rain sensors, condensation sensors (if your ac automatically kicks on), auto dimming mirrors.they all have different brackets and frit cutouts to allow them to work properly. those black dots that drop down in the center by the rearview mirror that most people think is an antenna? nope. just an extra sun shade that's supposed to help block the sun in between your visors. also, fun fact, if you ever need to break a window in your car for whatever reason, the smaller pieces of glass are often the most expensive piece of glass on your vehicle. go for a door tempered door glass. &#x200b; knowledge to some, but after almost a decade in auto glass, i learned that most people have zero clue when it comes to their auto glass. edit: more info/correction in terminology also - you do not need the oem glass unless the vendor recommends it for whatever reason. except for mopar and ford, manufacturers do not make their own glass. they buy from other companies (often pilkington, pgw for example), stamp their insignia on it and charge a ton for the part. if you really want oem brand, go look at the bug on your glass (where it shows the dot number, where the make insignia would be) and find the brand name there. most auto glass companies buy from those vendors too and would be happy to get you that specific brand part if you so desire. save yourself hundreds of dollars and do not go to the dealership to try to get this stuff fixed. they will try to sell you oem and its absolutely not necessary 9 times out of 10. oee is the equivalent and is perfectly fine to use.	1510	54062	bu1s5i	ep68tvs

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	modern cars arent made weaker than old cars, or at least not in the way people would expect. a good example of this is if an old car hits a modern car and the modern car is crumpled to fuck and the old car looks like nothing happened. the cars nowadays arent weaker or made cheaper, its a safety design and the reason this happens is so that if you have a collision the cars bodywork absorbs the energy of the impact and crumples, while you walk away from the crash relatively unharmed. an old car on the other hand doesnt absorb the impact, which means the energy of the impact is felt by everyone inside the car instead, which is extremely dangerous and depending on the severity of the accident can badly injure or kill the occupants of the vehicle. your car isnt cheaply made, its an intentional safety design by the company that has saved so many people from broken bones, potential paralysis and death.	487	54062	bu1s5i	ep7atxd

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	copying a comment of mine from elsewhere: science and research have an incredibly high social prestige  especially on sites like reddit that are populated by young, liberal, college-educated people. acquiring scientific knowledge is still considered by many one of the noblest human endeavors. the scientist is revered as this idealistic being focused purely on uncovering the truth of nature. however, the academic research system is deeply broken. it is a ponzi scheme based on the exploitation of young people. the majority of labor in the academic research system is performed by phd students and postdocs, who are overworked and underpaid, and who have very little opportunity to advance their careers in research. as a consequence, manipulation and cheating are epidemic in the academic community. what is valued are not truthfulness and the sober assessment of data - the most important thing for a young scientists is publication impact. accordingly, those scientists who are able to blow their results out of proportion (without being caught) have a clear advantage in academic research. in science, the bullshitters often win. and you cant really blame the bullshitters and cheaters since a high impact paper can oftentimes mean the difference between a stable job and poverty. whenever you see a scientific study (especially one making revolutionary claims), you should assume that it's bullshit until it has been replicated.	872	54062	bu1s5i	ep6qtyi

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	if you call 911 for something minor (flu-like symptoms, sprained ankle, etc.) you will usually be sent to the waiting room and triaged like every other walk in. you aren't saving yourself any time and we take great pleasure in watching your face when you realize the toe pain you've had for a week isn't a priority just because you took a ride in the boo boo bus. on the flip side, depending on the system, ems providers can do a lot to treat issues. just because something is serious or even life threatening doesn't mean we load the patient, fire up the sirens, and zoom to the hospital (with a few exceptions like trauma and stroke). rest assured, the 10-15 minutes we're in the back is being used to treat the problem and (hopefully) have you pretty much fixed by the time you get to the er. we have a lot of medications and tools to use and it's safer for everyone to do as much as possible in the driveway or parking lot if we can. please don't pound on the door yelling that we need to go when we're starting ivs, calculating doses, determining if we need advanced airways, etc. tl;dr: ems works very different than on tv (most of the time). edit: thanks for popping my gold cherry kind stranger.	2138	54062	bu1s5i	ep694m2

what fact is common knowledge to people who work in your field, but almost unknown to the rest of the population?	"about the judicial system (from a court reporter): voice recognition is nowhere near being able to help with court reporting (unless one person is reciting everything into a microphone perfectly, which is a form of court reporting called voice writing, and even then it needs heavy editing). language in general, especially clearly written language, is an artform. also, juries don't have anywhere near the amount of evidence before them that the media may have on a particular case. tons of things are precluded because they're too prejudicial or for a slew of other reasons. i just did a bank robbery case where the guy had 11 prior bank robbery convictions, and the jury wasn't allowed to know that. so don't jump to conclusions about what might have been an ""obviously wrong"" verdict. prosecutors and judges are not on the same team. the judge has no control over how aggressively the prosecution tries their case or what kinds of sentencing they go for. public defenders do amazing work and are paid $100 an hour in my state, so it's not like a minimum wage job; and they get to choose which cases they accept, so it's not like there are just three guys who get all the cases dumped on them. and they can do private practice concurrently. a ton of sex offenders have severe developmental delays and don't understand that what they're doing is wrong. putting them in maximum security prison makes their behavior worse because it's like letting a five-year-old be raised by a bunch of violent adults. there should be gentler rehabilitation centers and more humane confinement for them, imho. ""civil commitment for an indefinite period"" like we have in my state is basically a life sentence in a hardcore correctional facility. dcf can take kids away from really loving parents if it took the parents too long to get their sh\*t together after addiciton. the contingencies they place on parents during recovery are draconian and lapses are forbidden, even though they're a known part of rehabilitation. imagine losing your child because you chose to order a beer with dinner."	159	54062	bu1s5i	ep71k8z

whats something that cant be explained, it must be experienced?	before i became addicted to heroin i thought addicts we're just weak. no real man, no good person, no morally sound individual would throw their life away. it should be easy to stop once you take a step back and see what's happening. i had an alcoholic friend who i thought was insane for needing to go to aa. i didn't know what addiction was until i got hooked on heroin. i feel like there's no way to really get it until you're gripped by the power. i still don't think it's a disease but i also don't think that it's caused by stupidity or weakness. it's a scary thing. if i really liked chocolate cake but it made me sick as fuck between bites i'd never touch the stuff, but somehow i couldn't apply that logic to opiates.	29	36634	bmac4g	emw7f18
