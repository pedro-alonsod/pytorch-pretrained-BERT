Kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? Why or why not ?", "comments": [{"score": 25495, "id": "en27b8v", "text": "Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called \"Roosevelt's Tree Army,\" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  \n\nIn my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  \n\nI'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.\n\nEdit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as \"rustic\" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a \"stay the night\" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a \"history\" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   \n\nOther states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are."}, {"score": 4679, "id": "en2anug", "text": " I feel like instead of forcing people to do so, they should be encourajed too, for example if this was being forced by the state, instead of it forcing you to go, it would pay people to plant trees/ clean beaches, etc,\n\n This is the way to go"}, {"score": 2039, "id": "en254lj", "text": "I wouldn't make it mandatory but maybe optional and have it cover some school for the adults once they are done."}, {"score": 606, "id": "en2gacy", "text": "We already have Americorps, where you serve for very little compensation other than a stipend and some money for college."}, {"score": 306, "id": "en2p5ro", "text": "I feel like forcing people to do it will just sour them against it.

I generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. It would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects."}, {"score": 29, "id": "en2pfxb", "text": "Mandatory?

A 30 year old man with mild depressive symptoms was in-and-out of the hospital fairly quickly. He was under pressure from his home life, living with 4 roommates who were making life a bit difficult for him. No suicidal thoughts. He was cleared of all psychopathologies by me and two other doctors. \nA few months later he came back. Same symptoms, however this time he talked about 5 roommates. It felt wrong, and I digged in his story. Tried to contact his roommates. He lived alone and was severely psychotic. I have no idea to this day how he hid it so well from everyone.\n\nEDIT: a few more details:\nThe patient talked, dressed and acted normally however after admitting him for a longer period we noticed he talked with his \"roommates\" often. He was single, no contact with his family and somehow working, however in a routine job with little to no personal contact. \nAfter a few talks he also claimed other peoples thoughts were sometimes \"thrown at him and sitting on his head\", and he could thus read people's minds against his will. The interesting thing about this patient was, that his internal world somehow fitted the external world when asked - his roommates sounded perfectly plausible (they were not e.g. shadow-people, vikings, 12 m tall) and they teased him by hiding his stuff. But he ate with them, watched TV with them, so on. \nNormally a person with paranoid schizophrenia (paranoid meaning all types of delusions) will have multiple symptoms sometimes easy to see for the untrained eye. The patients can dress, talk and present themselves in odd ways, usually different from cultural norms. They can have incoherent speech, make up words and phrases or are clearly separated from reality (another patient of mine insisted that I was in jail for medicating him, even when we talked). \nWhen we quickly \"scan\" a patient for psychotic symptoms we basically look for inconsistencies in the patients experience of the world - the patients normally know \"something is wrong\" or \"weird\" or \"different\", but often belive it is the world around them, that have changed. This is due to discrepancy between what they experience (input), failed assessment of the inputs (due to the thinking disorder) and testing hypothesis based on failed assessments which collide with the real world. This will activate defense mechanisms fx denial, wild explanations, accepting both \"realities\" at the same time, and so on. (e.g \"I am not sick, my doctor must be a bad guy, bad guys are in jail, my doctor are in jail, but my doctor is sitting right in front of me at the same time, he must have an identical twin or this is an alternate reality). This is usually the way delusions are made. \n\nTo summarize: when we scan for psychosis, we look for inconsistencies between the patients subjective experience of thinking, being and acting and the objective reality accepted by the generel cultural norm. This patient managed to live in a subjective psychotic world that just fitted so well with the objective reality that he tricked several psychiatrists including myself."}, {"score": 686, "id": "eo8dens", "text": "I have a story of a friend who was severely mismanaged.

It wasnt a mass. They could actually see the \"mass\" growing as they did the MRI. No, she was having a massive stroke. \n\nShe was immediately taken in for surgery.

On workup was noted to have pulmonary edema (lung fluid buildup), metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, sinus tachy and raised CRP & WCC, suggestive of infection but no temperature. The initial diagnosis was sepsis.\n\nThis keen-eyed doctor, pretty fresh out of med school, decided to do a salicylate level on this lady because the hyperventilation paired with metabolic acidosis and AKI was enough to prompt her suspicions of aspirin poisoning, even though they could just as easily be explained by sepsis as well. \n\nThe level came back high. Not huge, but high, which prompted her to phone me for a second opinion on how relevant the finding was in terms of the patient's clinical picture.

Comparing a high level in chronic poisoning to the same level in acute poisoning, features are much more severe in chronic poisoning (i.e. pulmonary edema, hypoxia, AKI etc) - there is a disparity.

The hypervigilence looks like the hyperactivity found in ADHD and the hypomania/mania in Bipolar Disorder.

He did not return to the ER for 2 months because he did not have insurance and was homeless at the time. My alarm bells were already ringing at this point. I did an exam to look at the retina and saw numerous white plaques which is a sign of inflammation with infection being the most concerning. The patient ended up having syphilis that had gone into his eye and made him blind. Unfortunately, at this point his prognosis for recovering vision was poor even with treatment. \n\nThis next one was not really a miss but more of a delayed diagnosis. A patient came to the ER 1 month after a gunshot wound to the head. Did surprisingly well since the bullet missed most of the important structures in the brain. He was back in the ER as the swelling on his eye had not gotten better. It's common after a big trauma like that for the eye to be swollen for 1 to 2 weeks before getting better. He also was complaining of double vision. On exam his eye was swollen and being pushed forward out of orbit and he could not move his eye to the left. Given his history I was worried he developed something called an artery venous fistula which is where an artery and a vein combine causing the high pressure in the artery to enter the vein and build up a back pressure causing the vein to engorge because it can no longer drain blood. Got a ct scan to confirm. Patient went to surgery the next day.\n\nI do caution the general public to be weary of this thread though. It is unfair to doctors look at this thread and claim incompetence. Diseases usually develop on a continuum age and one doctor might catch it at a later date because it has had more time to present itself.\n\nThere is also a stepwise approach to medicine. If you gave everyone with a headache a ct scan there would be more harm then good. It's possible that when a person gets a second opinion they see the first doctor already ruled a lot of things out so they are in a better position to diagnose, whereas if you had stayed with the original doctor and continued to work with him he may have gotten to the diagnosis as well.\n\nAs a patient it can be frustrating but be mindful that most doctors do want what's best for you and there may be a lot of things going on in the background you are unaware of.\n\nFor example when patients come in for cold symptoms, they assess usually frustrated when they are told there is no treatment needed. They feel like it is a waste of a trip. But that doctor used his medical knowledge to 1. Reassure you 2. Avoid harmful if unneeded antibiotics 3.

They prescribed some meds and told me to take it easy. \n\nI was 25 at the time and had unfortunately already experienced pneumonia and walking pneumonia in years prior. Based on my previous experiences, I thought this was an odd diagnosis as I wasn\u2019t coughing at all. The last few times I\u2019d had it I was hacking up a lung so to speak... But- I was busy and tired and trusted them so I went on my way. \n\nI took the meds, rested, stayed home, but I was still sick- getting worse. So I decided to make a proper appointment with a doc to get this really checked out because something felt wrong. Unfortunately, my GP\u2019s schedule was full for the next month+ so I saw the next available doc. We\u2019ll call her Dr A. I went to see Dr A about a week after urgent care. Told her all my symptoms, how long it\u2019d been going on, etc. she told me it was regular old pneumonia and it was normal for my symptoms to get worse before they got better and that I should keep taking Tylenol for the headaches and fever and \u201cmonitor\u201d my temp (which was sitting at 100+ pretty much constantly). I told her I\u2019d had pneumonia before and this felt different. She made me feel like a LIAR and an idiot for even suggesting she might not be right with my diagnosis. I left feeling bummed, angry and still very sick. \n\nA few days later, my fatigue was insane and I started to see these painful bright red bumps cropping up on my legs. I\u2019d had hives before, and knew it wasn\u2019t that- no itching. I\u2019m allergic to both sulfa and penicillin antibiotics so I was worried I was having a reaction to the ones they gave me. I went in to see Dr A again. By then my legs were completely covered in huge raised pinkish red patches. Plus I still had a fever, chills, back pain, fatigue and headache. \n\nWhen I arrived, she told me she didn\u2019t know what the red patches were. She brought in her STUDENT for a second opinion- he didn\u2019t know either. Then she told me to go get blood drawn so she could run some tests. In the meantime, she told me to keep taking Tylenol and monitor my fever. Still treating me like a liar and an idiot. So I go down to get blood drawn which was excruciating. I was definitely dehydrated- they couldn\u2019t find a vein and tried both arms twice. I\u2019d given blood many times before then and never cried, but after the fourth try I was almost sobbing. I had a 100+ fever at this point and told them to please just take it from the veins on my hand which they had refused because it \u201churt more.\u201d I\u2019m like lady I\u2019m already crying- just do it. They do it. No pain. I leave. \n\nI wait to hear from Dr A with results. No word from her so I call. She says she didn\u2019t find anything and to keep \u201cmonitoring.\u201d  \n\nAt this point I had been sick for weeks. I\u2019m averaging 101\u00b0 fever daily. Ibuprofen isn\u2019t helping. I can barely walk. The red patches on my legs are spreading to my arms and torso. I\u2019m so tired I can barely do anything and my back pain and headache are constant. I\u2019m starting to notice breathing trouble- little bouts of too-fast breathing and my heart rate feels abnormally high. I\u2019m miserable. \n\nI schedule a phone appointment with Dr A because I\u2019m too weak to go in. She misses it. That night, as I\u2019m laying in bed with a 103+ fever that keeps going up, I start hyperventilating, or what feels like that. I can\u2019t catch my breath. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe.

Angel Nurse then proceeds to pop me in a wheelchair and personally wheel me to the ER which was next door to avoid sitting me with ambulance bills, though it\u2019s against their policy. \n\nOnce I get to the ER I\u2019m pumped wit fluids, given oxygen and am told my actual GP, who I\u2019ve never met, will be in to see me very soon. Several docs come by to take blood, evaluate, ask questions. They don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve got but they\u2019re going to figure it out. Im so relieved! \n\nI\u2019m admitted to the hospital and finally meet my actual GP in the morning. She is amazing and takes me seriously- asking questions and telling me what other departments she\u2019s looping in to help. She keeps popping back in to let me know where they\u2019re at with a diagnosis. By late morning- she\u2019s figured it out: fungal pneumonia with a complication (the red splotches) erythema nodosum. The antibiotics I\u2019d been given didn\u2019t do anything to help, which is why I\u2019d been getting worse. \n\nEverything worked out fine- I got the right meds and recovered. The red patches faded to bruises. But every time I think about that experience, I just wish I had been more insistent with Dr A. I was so angry with her for not taking me seriously and not doing her job. Her blas\u00e9 attitude towards my health, and my failure to push back, landed me in the freakin hospital. \n\nMoral of the story: get a second opinion.

Worries help keep us safe and let us know when there is danger.  It\u2019s the worries that interfere with daily functioning that become an issue.  I think of anxiety issues on a spectrum, on one end is a healthy dose and on the other is a diagnosable anxiety disorder.  There are people all across that spectrum that would benefit from therapy and/or learning some adaptive strategies.\n\nAs some have pointed out, a child\u2019s anxiety is not 100% a result of a parent\u2019s anxiety.  There are, of course, cases where a child develops anxiety due to other circumstances.\n\nHowever, in the majority of cases with anxiety in children, it can be treated by treating the parent.  Children look to their parents for guidance to learn about what is and isn\u2019t \u201csafe.\u201d  They are sponges that are constantly learning how to react to different things they approach.  One of the easiest examples to see this is when a child experiences a minor injury/scare, they will naturally look to a trusted adult to judge how they should react.  If the adult gasps, comes running with their arms extended, making a worried face, the child learns that was bad and they should be upset/hurt/scared.  If the parent was to smile, shrug, and say \u201coh man!\u201d  the child will likely brush it off and move on (unless they acquired an injury, of course).\n\nThink about this on a bigger scale, if a child is consistently learning the world is a scary and dangerous place, there are threats everywhere, etc. they are being set-up for anxiety issues.  Same goes for specific phobias, many of these are directly taught to children by seeing their parents fear.  Nothing says to be afraid of something more than the person you rely on for your survival showing their own genuine fear.  Simply following up with children regarding a scary or uncomfortable experience can make a world of difference!  If you can inform them of what made that specific experience dangerous or scary, that helps teach them what to look out for instead of generalizing that fear to any experience that involves the same factors.\n\nOne common example is children\u2019s fear of bugs.   The children have never had a bad experience with bugs, but the fact their parent runs away screaming from them each time she has an encounter, is a pretty clear message to them that they are not safe to be around.  Nothing like the person you trust most in this world expressing panic to discourage you from even getting close to them, especially when she tried reinforces your anxious reactions by holding you and crying with you after you nearly escape death by a caterpillar!"}, {"score": 6292, "id": "ep6ditd", "text": "Office copiers cost upwards of $7,000 some can go for $15,000-20,000 depending on print speed and capacity"}, {"score": 57186, "id": "ep6aqhz", "text": "An elevator will go up to the top of the hoist instead of crash to the floor in most catastrophic failures due to the counter weights."}, {"score": 1525, "id": "ep6yh83", "text": "I'm a lifeguard so nothing special, but while training to be one I learned that nearly no drowning victims ever wake back up.

Our job was to catalog everything our clients wanted to move and then provide the best possible price while lying through our teeth about the service itself.

On moving day, the movers who showed up were often in unmarked trucks or ones with completely different names and branding on them. The workers were often immigrants who were paid under-the-table and had no experience whatsoever. The deliveries themselves often took a long time and items were often lost as multiple moves would be stacked into one truck without much labeling of items or categorizing in general. As mentioned earlier, we changed company names fairly often as the negative reviews and bad press stacked up.\n\nMoving is a toxic business, and people will always try to undermine and cheat. This is something you should never cheap out on as the money is well worth the comfort of knowing your move is in good hands.\n\nIf you are moving, I recommend finding a company that is local if possible, so that you can meet the people who represent it and see that their business is legitimate. More importantly, they will be able to send someone to survey your belongings and give a more realistic quote and time estimate.

After being in the industry for a while you get a spidey sense for when people are going to do dumb things and can often steer them away from doing anything too bad. That being said, here's one of my favourite stories to tell.\n\nI was 7 months pregnant and it was the week before I went on maternity leave. I was driving out to one of our sites and to get there I had to drive (on the road of course) through our penguin colony. This particular species of penguin burrows underground and stays hidden in their burrow during the day, and comes out at night when birds of prey and other potential predators have gone to sleep. As I'm driving out to the site I realise the parking lot up ahead is full and people have started parking up and down the road. And that's when I see a giant SUV pull off the road, drive between the bollards and into the penguin colony. I pull over as what seems like 20 non-English speaking tourists start to pile out of the vehicle and take selfies with the ocean backdrop. Staying as calm as possible and using sign language I point out the no entry signs of the bollards they drove past, the burrows they have just collapsed, inform them they may have killed penguins, and to get their fucking vehicle out of the fucking colony.\n\nOnce I got them out of there I started digging out the collapsed burrows to check for penguins. The first four were luckily empty but the last one had a breeding pair. I get the girl out, check her over for injuries, and having no where else to put her I follow protocol and tuck her under my left arm against my side. I get the boy out and put him in the same position on the right side and start to check him over. Remember how I said I was pregnant? Well normally, you hold a penguin down low almost on your hip, but because of my round tummy I was holding him more at the bottom of my ribcage. So when I turned my head to start my health check, the bastard reached up and grabbed my top lip with his beak and ripped straight through the middle.\n\nIt was about this time that the tourists walking along the road realised this ranger was holding onto two penguins. I had five or six tourists sprint through the colony towards me and start snapping pictures. While at the same time potentially collapsing more burrows. If any internet sleuths stumble across a picture of a heavily pregnant, pissed off looking ranger, holding two penguins with blood pouring down her face let me know. I've been waiting for that picture to show up for 3 years and haven't found it yet.\n\nHappy ending, I chased away the photographers, popped the two uninjured penguins in a nearby unoccupied burrow, and radioed for back up to help with the parking situation. My lip healed without a scar, and both penguins left the following morning for a well deserved day in the ocean.\n\nTL;DR Signage is there for a reason. Rules are there for a reason. If you don't know what the reason is, doesn't mean you should break the rules.  \n\n\nEDITS:\n\nReal TL;DR Tourists drove over penguin burrows. No penguins were harmed in the making of this story.

When you would call them out on their behavior as being inappropriate they would act like you were wrong for getting offended by it and that we should accept it since we were demonstrating life in the 18th century.

It wasn\u2019t a difficult job; the two biggest things we were responsible for were running our trips in a timely manner and ensuring that the guests in our boat had a fun and SAFE trip down the river. \n\nThe safety part is important, because people visiting the river frequently forget that it is a natural wilderness feature and carries all of the associated dangers. We frequently received questions about whether the rafts were on tracks, whether I actually had to do anything in the back, and (my personal favorite) whether the river went in a circle and we would end up back where we started. This last question was particularly funny because we TOOK A BUS from the rafting outpost to the put-in of the river \u2014 why bother if we were going in a circle?!\n\nOne summer afternoon, I had a boat with three groups of two people; one of those groups was a mother and son. The mother seemed nice, if timid, as did the son. However, as I was going through the routine of explaining the safety concerns and paddle commands, it started to dawn on me that he was not very bright. There was nothing wrong with him \u2014 he was just dumb as shit. \n\nOnce we were on the river, he almost immediately developed a habit of checking the depth of the water with his paddle. He would incessantly plunge the blade into the water without care nor concern for his surroundings and circumstances. The water on this river is pristine. Almost crystal clear. The riverbed is visible almost constantly, and still, this young man felt the need to verify the veracity of his own eyeballs by shoving his paddle into the river like some sort of deranged perpetual motion machine. \n\nOf course, I warned him against his actions. At first, my concerns were that his depth-checking interferes with his ability to follow my commands and paddle. Eventually, however, my pleading grew more desperate as it dawned on me that this child paid no deference to my authority. He answered only to chaos. \n\nIt finally came to a head when, in a portion of the river that was extremely shallow (probably no more than a foot deep), he plunged his paddle into the riverbed with a force that shook the surrounding countryside. Like Excalibur, the paddle wedged itself among the rocks, perfectly erect. The boy, with a staid iron grip that could only be wielded by someone incredibly dense, kept his hand on the paddle as the rushing water carried us away from its new location. In one swift motion, he was wrenched from the raft and landed in a foot of water. He wore a face of bewildered idiocy. \n\nIt was quite satisfying to keep his paddle in the back with me for the remainder of the trip after I returned him safely to the raft. All he could do was stare wistfully at the riverbed, his poo brain longing to verify its depth."}, {"score": 21027, "id": "eo0qwan", "text": "Tour guide at a university.\n\nSmall group gets into our gardens where there's a big turtle pond.

But the worst was a bus load full of asian tourists (12) came to ride. Only one of them spoke English and he was about 9 years old. Every time one of the girls got on a horse they would cry. i already knew this next hour to hour and a half was going to be hell so I decided to put a lead rope on the horse the kid who could translate was riding, and i had him stay with me the entire time. (There was another guide in the front) when we got out to the forest the kids father demanded that we stopped. He wanted me to take a picture of all of them after they got to the top of this super steep mountain. He starts kicking and smacking his horse and he is yelling at all of his family members to do the same before the kid even finishes translating what his father said. I asked the kid to tell them to stop. Tell them no. The kid is trying but they are all turning up this hill and not listening.\n\n Now these horses were well trained and mannered but they also will listen even though they have been trained to stay in line. So the father gets his horse going up this hill and smacks his horses butt one more time and his horse takes off up this mountain.\n Idk if anyone has watched how a horse runns up a mountain but the almost hop. Its not easy to stay on. The worst part is, About 7 of the 12 horses follow suite and start running up this mountain. The other guide and i look at one another in panic mode as all these peoples screams are fading up this hill. Thankfully the other guide and i can think quick. She grabs the few remaining horses that didnt run as all of their riders are also screaming and crying and yelling. I decide I need the translator boy to stay with me so i tell him what I am going to do, how to hold on and i ask him if he thinks he can do it so we can go stop all these horses. He nods leans forward and holds on as i get both are horses running up the hill. When I reach the top 4 of the older horses had slowed down and were eating so i tell the boy to tell them to get off the horses. He replies they dont know how and are too scared i (try not to show my irritation) jump off my horse as i tell him to give them my instructions step for step. He does but they all shake their heads as they are death gripping the horn. Thank God asians are usually light and small. I basicaly had to lift/drag them off of the horses. I told them all to start walking down the hill and go with the others. I tied up their horses to the nearest tree asked the boy to hold on tight again and took off looking for the others. I finally found a younger man and his wife(?) she was covered in pine needles with a few scratches on her arms and covered in dirt. The boy (i assume) asks what happened then tells me her horse went under a tree and she didnt fit. The mans horse was behind hers so it stopped barely missing her and he got off to help her. I again told them to start walking and i tie up his horse. So now i have 2 missing horses and 1 missing tourist...\n\n\nIt took me and that boy 40 min to finally catch up and find his father.

Everyone is in hysterics at this point. Then the first glass was smashed. I think it was an accident, but the next 30 glasses smashing wasn't. The lads went fucking insane, they started throwing chairs around the place and smashing glasses. A few fights break out as there's a bunch of other people in this pub who aren't taking their shit.

I went to the restroom, saw the stunned remains of an absolute unit of a turd, which the toilet did not fully eradicate. Went to another stall, just as disgusting as the first. Third was less nasty, but there was something on the toilet seat (liquid, not solid) and just decided to wait til I got home to release the build-up of at least 3 days worth of shit. I should've taken my opportunity with stall number three. Oh, how I regret that decision.\n\nMath and History went off fine, in between those classes and my last class was a break, in which time I decided was a great time to get a snack and a can of Coke. Consumed both quickly and headed upstairs for Computer. I sat down, and immediately the urge hit me. I waited. And waited. And waited. Class started, and we were to do our assignments. We were allowed to do them unmonitered, as she was super lax and didn't care - we could literally cheat and she wouldn't care.\n\nI was naturally good at typing (thanks to Runescape) and finished my assignments. I immediately darted out the class without asking to use the restroom, or with the bathroom pass, which was a big no-no in my school. I had a detention waiting for me when I got back, but I didn't care. I was just seconds away from my shit providing enough thrust to launch me to the stratosphere.\n\nI went to the bathroom, and wouldn't you know it, all the stalls are full. So, I did the only reasonable thing I could do. I went to the girls restroom. I then second-guessed that thought. So now, I was torn. Do I wait? Do I go down the stairs and risk shitting my way to the moon? Do I risk getting caught by a girl in the girls room?\n\nI made a decision to go downstairs, and I could feel it nearly poking out my sphincter. So I ran into the restroom, pulled my pants off and placed them on my bag (I like to poop naked, sue me) and before I sat, I looked. It was the grossest stall of all time. *SOMEONE DIDNT FLUSH! RED ALERT, RED ALERT!* My little 12 year old brain could not stand the thought of my shit touching someone elses shit, and risking the possibility of the shit splashing back onto my ass. So, I squatted ABOVE the toilet seat, and released.\n\nMy calculations were so exact, that with the force I exerted on my sphincter, and the proximity of my asshole to the toilet, that I thought the shit was gonna land square in the hole, and all would be said and done. My calculations were off. By a lot. I was a good couple inches from being anywhere close to the toilet. So I shat *RIGHT INFRONT OF THE TOILET*\n\nI went into panick mode. I flipped out; do I clean it up? Do I let Leguizama (the schools janitor) clean it up? Am I gonna get a detention for this? Or worse, a Saturday school??? So, I wiped, put the TP in the toilet, and didn't even flush. I washed and walked out, obviously panicked. I was so self concious and anxious at the time, that I sprayed myself down with the choicest body spray around, Axe body spray, to mask the smell of shit that I know would linger around until I showered.\n\nI walked out of that stall anxious as could be, and got a drink of water, and went back to class.\n\nThe next day, an announcement was made before the Pledge of Allegiance, stating that there was a dookie dropped in FRONT of the toilet, and not IN the toilet in the bathroom across the computer lab. For some reason, I felt proud of myself. I wasn't caught, and I'm sure Mr. Leguizama was the one who cleaned it up."}, {"score": 3371, "id": "en5yg96", "text": "This question needs upvotes.

Full of blood, poop, tampons even maybe some pads idk I almost lurched anyway my need to pee wasn\u2019t going anywhere so feeling like I have zero choice - I had been looking for awhile for a bathroom that didn\u2019t say \u201cpatients only\u201d for a good twenty minutes and it was like 3 in the morning I had drank lots of caffeine anywho there I go and pee on the floor. I find my way back to our little designated icu lounge we had kind of a private area with all the possible amenities of a hospital you could imagine decent ish lounge chairs, pillows, blankets, free soda and snacks all you could need with the exception of working restrooms. Now, there were restrooms there in that utopia of a hospital waiting area but they both had \u201cclosed for cleaning\u201d signs and had them for awhile. I feel like maybe they just put them on at night so not to be bothered with them and it seemed in all the little private family lounge areas all was quite except for ours and I guess maybe because the heart attack had just happened that day with an emergency surgery the adrenaline of the day made it to where we just couldn\u2019t sleep. So after doing my dirty business in the dirty bathroom I return and my sister is gone. Now this is about 2004 or so, we had cellphones but I don\u2019t think we had texting or if we did it was limited and yada yada so I\u2019m clueless as to where she was but unconcerned I had been missing awhile I assume she goes to look for me- we had some sort of device that the nurses station let us know if there was an issue with my dad so I settle back in and she returns to tell me the exact same story I had about a disgusting bathroom that she pees on the floor of because she sees no alternative. Now we\u2019re not sure at this point if it\u2019s the same bathroom because we had both wandered aimlessly to find it. The hospital is big and all we both knew is that it we didn\u2019t leave the cardiac area- we were both scared of getting lost (in hindsight why we didn\u2019t just go together is beyond me). At any rate she said the floor had been wet but with the toilet I saw being overflowed and nasty we still didn\u2019t know. The day had been awful and my dad went from most likely being dead to most likely being okay by midnight that night we had been through it and suddenly nothing was more important to us than knowing if we golden showered the same bathroom so we went to find it. We stumble upon the place that, sure enough, we both had used only to see another woman stumble out, shell shocked, and advising us to find another toilet.

My parents insisted they did, and Comcast wanted the UPS receipt, which obviously we no longer had because it was five years ago and we hadn't heard anything from them before this. So my parents refused to pay, Comcast sent a collections company after us, and when my parents explained the situation to the collection company, they were like \"those fuckers, we'll take care of this.\" That was, thankfully, the end of it."}, {"score": 23915, "id": "enmihul", "text": "If I see something is being shipped by OnTrac, I'll cancel.

This is a story from a long time ago, during the summer after my first year of law school when I was briefly working at a well-known criminal defense firm.\n\nThe client whose case I was working was one of several defendants charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Three individuals had committed the murders, and several others had either helped plan it, abducted the victims, came along to watch, or ***filmed*** it.\n\nIn order to see whether our client was one of the individuals present at the scene, I had to watch multiple videos of the murders. I watched multiple people brutally killed in about the worst possible way you can imagine - >!they were chopped into pieces while they were alive and had their skulls stomped in. It wasn\u2019t some grainy security footage. It was HD video taken by bystanders just a few feet away.

I never looked up the sentence from the case, and have no desire to. In our case there was no presumption of innocence - the individuals involved had all taken pleas in hope that the prosecutors wouldn\u2019t seek the death penalty. The only thing that would change was whether our client would get the death penalty (if he was present/filming) or life in prison (if we showed that he played a more minimal role).

The age ranges in the class can vary, and we probably had a mix of people between 12-18, but most were somewhere in the middle. \n\nThere was this one kid, probably 16-17 that really stood out to me and my friend as the typical \"school shooter\" type. Very solemn look on his face at all times, socially awkward and extremely quiet. We both got really strong serial killer vibes from him.

This lasted for probably the first 2 hours of the 4 hour class.

We were the only 3 in the changeroom and were intent on leaving as fast as possible. Eventually, my friend makes eye contact with the guy, who screams something along the lines of \"STOP LOOKING AT ME\", pulling a switchblade out of his swim bag and lunging at my friend. I stood there, somewhat frozen as this was happening and didn't really know what to do - whether to try and help or run. My friend ended up blocking the initial lunge with the locker door, and he sprinted towards the front exit of the changeroom, with this enraged knife-wielding teenager chasing him. When my friend had made it out of the changeroom the maniac turned around and started chasing me down.

My friend was still out in the lobby now with a ton of concerned parents around trying to figure out what was going on. Turns out when he blocked the knife with the locker door the knife got his forearm and he was bleeding pretty badly (not arterial, but probably a 6\" gash on the hairy part of your arm) Immediately my instructor ushered us away and called the police, building went into lockdown, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo this day I have no idea what happened to that kid - he never came back to the class, and the police didn't find him that night.

In middle and high school my next door neighbors were a boy one year younger than me (John) and his younger brother who was four years younger than him (Nathan.) My own younger brother and I had a similar age gap, and we found ourselves around each other all the time. Now I am a female and the rest of the group was all males, so there were just naturally times when the three of them would hang and I wouldn't be around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day my little brother who was around 9 at the time comes home with a porno mag and is telling me about the porn videos they were watching as a little unit. Now guys, I have no idea if this is something that is done in your pre/adolescent circles, but it freaked me the hell out and I told my mom. My mom then went and told their single dad. What I didn't know was their dad was an abusive piece of shit who beat both of those boys so badly that they couldn't go to school for weeks. No, we didn't call the police - we just filed it away and knew from that point forward to never tattle. I still carry the guilt of telling on John and Nathan with me to this day, because it set off a chain of events I would have never anticipated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we got older, the brothers started acting out more and more; bullying other kids, vandalism, weird shit like toying with road kill. As the level headed female in the group I opposed all of these things, and a faction emerged with me and the other neighborhood kids on one side, and John and Nathan on the other just fucking shit up and causing trouble. One day I had done SOMETHING to piss off John, and he came at me with a large chef's knife. I didn't have shoes on, so I took off running through the backyard and crossed into the neighbor's.  John was hot on my tail, trailing me by maybe 4 feet when I fell down. There was some sort of exposed PVC drainage pipe that had been shattered at the top that I didn't see it and ran over, my foot was sliced open immediately and I went down screaming. I think it shocked him; my screaming, the sudden change of pace, and the blood. He stopped, laughed at me, then ran home- presumably so he didn't get his ass whipped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I took care of myself, I told my mom what happened with the knife. She had started dating someone new, and I think this was the sort of feather that broke the camels back. We moved to another part of town in the same district about a ten-minute drive from our old house. Around that exact time we moved in, a new family moved into the house on the other side of John and Nate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings continued down a bad path for those boys. Over the next year they got in trouble with school, and would randomly show up at our new house locked out of their own. The year I went off to college I received a panicked phone call from my mom telling me to look up the local newspaper,  John had murdered the girl who had moved into the other house next door to him. It was really grisley too, he chopped her up and stuffed her into a trunk that sat outside in his dad's car all day while a family picnic was happening. He and his little brother got caught trying to throw the trunk into the river from a bridge at night by a cop who happened to be driving by.  I just thought to myself that could have been me! Both brothers have been locked up for what has to be about ten years at this point, they were both tried and convicted as adults. Everyone in our town just wants to see them burn in hell, but honestly the only thing I can think about is how it might have been different if our family reported the abuse from the onset - maybe their little minds would'nt have warped from a tender age."}, {"score": 10977, "id": "enh2d1h", "text": "I got jumped by two grown men when I was a freshmen in college.

I go to retrieve the discs for the pornography in question, which we kept in giant CD binders that held about 500-750 discs when completely full, which they were in this case, since we had just received some new stuff.

Everything seemed totally normal- we were making casual small conversation- and once we got to the spot I said \"hold on, I have to take a piss\". Turned my back on him to do the deed and next thing I felt was a super hard punch to my upper right back. Turns out this \"punch\" was actually a stab- specifically, a stab with an 8\" knife. He was kind enough to A) inform me I'd been stabbed and B) remove the knife. Survival instinct kicked in and I fell to the ground pretending to be dead, because he would of kept going otherwise. Once I fell to the ground he took my watch off my hand, which we soon learned (according to him) was the impetus for the stabbing- he planned to pawn it (a $200 Fossil watch my mom bought my on vacation to Italy a couple years earlier) and buy some coke. Once he ran off and I started getting up I noticed something was very wrong... I couldn't breath. My friends happened to be behind the school when I emerged from the wooded area yelling for them to go get help as I'd just been stabbed. They thought I was joking around as I usually did, but one of them finally came over after I fell to my knees and saw I was being for real, blood going everywhere. They'd fetched a teacher who proved to be the human embodiment of incompetence- she got the bright idea to have me lay on my stomach, which could of expedited the process of flooding my lungs with blood, but thankfully didn't as I only stayed in that position for a few seconds. The pain began to intensify as I was constantly gasping for air, but also some nerve damage had been done and my movement was greatly constricted. They propped me up against the lockers by the back entrance, where my blood coated the wall, and it took about 25 min for the ambulance to arrive. I was still in a great deal of pain even with the oxygen mask on, but it was nothing compared to the pain I'd experience shortly after in the ER/OR where they made a 5-6\" incision under my armpit in order to get at my lung so that they could insert a chest tube. The feeling of having the doctors hands INSIDE of me, feeling around and holding my lung while I was still awake (under local anaesthetic) is the most bizarre thing I've ever encountered and a sensation I will never forget. I still don't know why they couldn't have put me under fully for such a procedure instead of administering local all around my body... At this point my parents had been brought in and were in hysterics after seeing me on the OR table with blood everywhere. My mom was at home when the principal called to notify her what'd happened and ordered a cop to drive her to the hospital, a trauma centre about 30 min away from our home. My dad was at work on a construction site and went into a rage, getting together a band of his friends/workers to come to the hospital to find out who did this- they wanted to go kill the guy, but my mom managed to talk some sense into him. I was the most innocent 15 year old kid, never into drugs, alcohol, gangs, etc. and struggled for a long time with the question of \"why me?\" when there were so many much worse people out there than me... not that anyone deserves this kind of punishment. Was a $200 watch worth it? I spent a couple weeks in the hospitals trauma unit and then a further month or two at home recovering. Whoever stitched me up did a horrible job as they kept coming undone and I had to visit the ER several times to have that fixed... bleeding out in public was NOT fun... Psychologically it honestly didn't do too much damage as I think I was just too young to grasp the full weight of what'd happened... but physically it left the entire area around my upper right back and right arm/armpit completely numb for the rest of my life. I was also told that the lung could randomly collapse at any time-- apparently that's a possibility for those having suffered a traumatic pneumothorax, can anyone confirm?--, but it's been almost 15 years since the incident and I haven't had any major issues with the lung thus far. The guy who did it was 17 and protected by the young offenders act here in Canada, which means he did zero jail time for this... I think he just got some community service hours.

Me, being what like 10 whined \"what's happening\" and my parents basically quietly and sternly told me to shut the fuck up and stay down. Any time the guys with guns ask our tour guide questions he would just mumble responses and not look up. Apparently my mom watched the dudes rubbing their crotches and staring at her and my sister (who is just a year older than me). After probably like 10 minutes (but it was so long ago and I was so young I don't really know) the dudes put their guns down, hop in their vehicle, and drive away. While pressing our tour guide for questions we would only get response like \"oh they were just game wardens looking for poachers\" and other bullshit. \n\nTurns out it was (according to my parents after snooping around) a Kenyan militia who goes around and kidnaps tourist groups to hold for ransom. They stop one group, call up the owner of the park/ preserve, and say basically they'll let this group go if he agrees to pay the ransom but if he doesn't they'll kill them and ruin his business if they don't get X amount of money. If the game warden agrees to their ransom then they let the first group go. If he doesn't then they kill and/or rape them. And then try again with the next group. If he doesn't pay the ransom by then, well you get the picture. \n\nAwfully, although this was one of the more urgent near death experiences our family has had, we still laugh about it since something terrible like this happens on nearly every trip we go on with the family.

Also in Tanzania I stuck my face in a boomslang and didn't notice. India something else happened but I don't remember what, I'll add it if I remember. It's a running gag with our family at this point, and we just assume any family trip we take something awful will go wrong. So much weird random shit happens to our family that our friends ask \"what happened this time?\" after a trip.\n\nEDIT\nI remembered another story from South Africa, while we were out on safari a thunderstorm had rolled in, so we headed back to the camps. A bolt of lightning had struck the building directly next to ours (like 15 feet away) and burned it to the ground. The lady who was staying there, another tourist, handled it super well.

When he was out there he asked me on my head set if my boyfriend would have left me roses on my car. In response to that, I told him no, because the guy I was dating at the time was at home and didn't have a car. He told me \"huh, that's weird, you have a stuffed animal rose in your car door handle and it has a weird smiley face written on the tag... it must be one of your stalkers\" he said jokingly. But I was wondering who could have left me that- so when it slowed down my manager and I watched footage on the security cameras and we see a car back into the space next to mine- roll down its window- and stick the plush rose into my door handle and speed off. I didn't recognize the car so my manager told me he would walk me to my car when we left.\n\nHe walked me to my car and I started driving down the road- I got a call from him about one minute later where he sounded frantic saying that the guy who stuck the rose in my handle was waiting in a parking lot across the street and went through our grocery parking lot going about 85 trying to catch up to me and that I was most likely being followed... which is also when my phone died, and I didn't have a charger in my car.

I went around the abandoned pumps and what do you know- it is the same car and he follows me around the pumps too. At this point I want to cry and I'm in a panic.

I worked the whole year to save enough money to live for a couple of months in a city I loved before college. I left with an air mattress, a laptop, a suitcase of clothes, and a few essentials and moved into a shared house. I quickly made friends with my housemates and found that everyone I met had an amazing story and somehow we all ended up there at that moment, I decided I wanted to meet lots of new people and experience everything the city had to offer. I didn\u2019t have a car so I would have to use public transit, or walk, for my adventures. \n\nA month went by and everything was going better than I had ever dreamed, I was so happy!

I made a friend who lived in the area and they told me I could come there for the night when I was done since public transport would likely be closed for the night. So I got my things together and made my way there. After I got the pictures I wanted I decided to sit on a bench and listen to a man singing opera on the street, it was utterly beautiful and I decided I needed to meet this person and learn his story too. We got to talking and several other people joined the conversation; two girls from Europe and three men from the city. Eventually we all parted ways and I decided it was time to contact my friend about coming over... only my friend never answered. I tried for about 30 minutes and waited in the same spot until the three men from earlier came back and asked if I had any plans for the rest of the night. I said I did but now I\u2019m not sure, I might have to walk home. They offered to walk with me and handed me a bottle of rum they were drinking, said might as well have fun on the walk. Thinking about how everyone I met to that point had been wonderful, and that I had a better chance at being safe walking with three men than alone, I obliged and took a drink. Stupid. So stupid. \n\nAfter I was sufficiently liquored up they offered to get a taxi since I was having a hard time remembering the way home. They hailed one and I got in and thanked them, but they got in too. They then spoke to the driver in Spanish and the driver started going somewhere I couldn\u2019t recognize. I asked where we were going and they told me, \u201cThe Jungle.\u201d At that point one of them was talking to the driver loudly while another started groping me. I did everything I could to stop him but I couldn\u2019t in my state. When we got to \u201cthe jungle\u201d they all started groping. I fought back as hard as I could, I tried everything to get away... after I was effectively beaten to an utter pulp one pulled out a knife, another a gun. I stopped fighting back. They raped me for 6 hours before someone finally heard and investigated. I grabbed what I could of my things at that moment and made a run for it, getting to the closest populated area I could to wait for a taxi. \n\nWhen I went to the hospital a few hours later, after having passed out immediately upon arriving home, I realized just to what extent I was hurt. Every. Single. Inch. Of my body was bruised or cut and covered in blood. I filed a report and had a kit done, then they gave me a gallon bag of medications that would help me to not get an STD. I was able to gather later, when talking to the police, that they were in a gang. My best guess is MS13 from the things they said and what they called each other... when the dna tested positive for two wanted individuals I asked them to confirm my suspicion, but they said they could only confirm they were in a gang and not which one specifically.

[/u/jimthefeeder](https://www.reddit.com/u/jimthefeeder)) of women with their legs painted yellow. Not the torso, not the feet, just the legs, and specifically the color yellow. It is named fedlegs because the fictional process for getting their legs yellowed is known as \"Feeding The Legs\" All in all, a very benign fetish, but the lore of the creator is what I think makes this a real contender. Below are the highlights from the [stickied post on the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fedlegs/comments/8xzk6a/fedleg_explanation_updated_due_to_expanding/) detailing his creation, implementation, and outcome of the \"Leg Feeding Procedure\", along with the Dr. Fedleg Universe, which is a parallel universe to our own. \n\n \u2022 Wondered if it was possible to create a fetish from scratch. Based on what I've read it's a mix of: light bondage, leggings, orgasm denial, and ownership/marking in the vein of The Scarlet Letter (I assume that's a fetish, I don't know if there's an exact term for it.)\n\n \u2022 He has an detailed universe of how the system works. Who/Why people get \"Fedlegged\". Mostly based on the kind of clothing they wear. If they've got their legs visible to be seen, they're getting \"Fedlegged\". \n\n \u2022 In universe, everyone is aware of Doctor Fedleg, (full name Charles Fed Ostrog), the person who got the process of leg painting legalized; he has the government's support. He developed sustainable clean/renewable energy which is why he's successful. \n\n \u2022 He never wishes to see women injured/beat/hurt during the process.\n\n \u2022 \"His reasoning is a mystery, but the one thing for certain is that it has nothing to do with religion.\" - actual line in the writing.\n\n \u2022 On the 2014 midterm elections, prosecution for Dr. Fedleg was added onto the ballot; people voted against prosecuting him due to his successful ocean clean up act. \n\n \u2022 Dr. Fedleg has various kinds of paints that last certain durations. He also has a blend of the paint that can stop excessively revealing women, slutty, or rude women from having orgasms. Dr. Fedleg is the only person with permission to apply this special paint. \n\nRegardless, I find the whole thing fascinating. What led to creation of the character? Why create this universe to have it all work? Why does Dr. Fedleg care about the environment so much? Is it to be relatable to other people that might stumble across this, or is it the author inserting his own beliefs into the lore? Why did he choose the 2014 midterm election? The post was written in July of 2018, so the closest upcoming midterm election would have been 4 months away, but he instead chose to go back to 2014, which I think would indicate he's been thinking about this for a while.

My last job was in purchasing and we used a lot of spreadsheets. I started out learning formulas to do things quicker. Then I moved to more in-depth formulas like VLOOKUP, then INDEX-MATCH. I would just look at a process that I was doing in Excel, wonder if it could be done quicker or automatically, then Google how to do it. Eventually this lead to automating things in Excel using VBA. I have literally no background in technology but it wasn't hard to figure out! Before I left that job, I had multiple reports in Excel that would open themselves up at scheduled points in the day, update themselves, then email themselves to the correct people.\n\n\n\nI'm an attorney now, but I run my day through a schedule I made in Excel. It has all my cases and times/dates. It has a data entry form that I can use to quickly update the schedule or add to it. If I click on the cell with the opposing counsel's name, it brings up their full contact info plus an option to draft an email to them. The email auto fills the subject line with the case number and defendant's name, automatically has my signature, and starts the email off with \"(Attorney Name),\".\n\n\n\nWhen I add a new case, the schedule creates a new folder for it in a designated location and autofills that folder with templates of Word documents that I use for notes and trial prep. If I click on the cell with the next hearing's date, it pulls up a little calendar with that date circled and tells me how many work days I have to prepare. \n\n\n\nIt also tracks how my cases are resolved. I'm working on that today, actually. The goal is to be able to click a button and get a report that breaks down cases by outcome, judge, opposing attorney, and crime. Then I can use it to look for places I need improvement.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n\nTo clear up some confusion, we do have case management software and I do use it religiously. But when I started, I was bouncing between that software, physical calendars, emailed calendars in Excel, physical notes on legal pads/sticky notes, business cards, etc. etc. It was a pain in the ass, so I made this as a kind of hub to keep me organized. It basically shows me what cases need worked on in the management software and when that work needs done. And it organizes it all in chronological order while giving me a centralized area that has quick access to things like my notes or contact information. \n\n\n\nAs far as learning how to do things in Excel, I found that you will almost always learn more and retain information better if you have a goal in mind. If you go into this wanting to learn how to automate a weekly sales forecast, it will be so much easier than if you go in just wanting to know more about Excel in general. \n\n\n\nI'm trying to reply to comments and questions, but there are a lot!

Why did God create them?\u201d  \nThe Master responds \u201cGod created atheists to teach us the most important lesson of them all \u2014 the lesson of true compassion. You see, when an atheist performs an act of charity, visits someone who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is not doing so because of some religious teaching. He does not believe that God commanded him to perform this act. In fact, he does not believe in God at all, so his acts are based on an inner sense of morality. And look at the kindness he can bestow upon others simply because he feels it to be right.\u201d  \n\u201cThis means,\u201d the Master continued \u201cthat when someone reaches out to you for help, you should never say \u2018I pray that God will help you.\u2019 Instead for the moment, you should become an atheist, imagine that there is no God who can help, and say \u2018I will help you.\u2019\u201d  \n\u2014Martin Buber, Tales of Hasidim Vol. 2 (1991)"}, {"score": 1106, "id": "en2hvpz", "text": "Forgiveness.\n\nI seen a video of a family that has son killed and it's tear jerking.

I love the religions that offer some kind of support system for people who need help (medical bills, losing jobs).

You can do meetups, but most aren't held on a weekly schedule if they're consistent at all.

I despise companies that talk about being a family (that you lose when fired), and I'm cynical about team-building exercises and companies where everyone hangs out with each other on weekends. It leads to nasty cliques, people taking work too seriously, and people working hard because their whole life centers around it.

Sometimes, the eggs don\u2019t feel like it going, and they venture off. And if fertilized, it\u2019s considered an ectopic pregnancy. It can plant anywhere in the abdominal cavity at that point. Most of the time, it will die because it has to plant in a well vascularized region to be viable. Sometimes, it finds a good, bloody spot, and starts growing there. At that point it\u2019s essentially a tumor, and of it can eat enough into a blood vessel, in can rupture and bleed like shit.\n\n\n\nYou would think that millions of years of evolution would create a Fallopian tube that opens up right to the ovary, but that\u2019s not the case"}, {"score": 4556, "id": "enec9un", "text": "Right now my shin is itchy for no goddamn reason.

Contemporary and unbiased sources actually suggest she was rather plain, but it was her intellect and charming conversation that got her power. Also, as far as sexual relations go, her affairs with Julius Caesar and Antony, as well as her traditional marriages to her brothers, aren\u2019t bad compared to the well-known affairs of some other figures, especially Antony. Defaming Cleopatra made her easier to demonize and portray as a seductress ruling over Antony, making war easier for Octavian. \n\n-Marcus Lepidus was useless. In reality, though he lacked the clout or force of personality that Octavian and Antony wielded, he was a competent administrator and leader who played a key role in defeating Sextus Pompey. He was a big enough political threat that both Antony and Octavian wanted him gone, but couldn\u2019t just kill him (he was forced into joining the priesthood as a solution). Octavian would rather just have people forget that he wasn\u2019t the only \u201ctrue\u201d Roman option (Antony being, semi-fairly, perceived as far too decadent).\n\n-Sextus Pompey was a barbaric pirate king who raped and plundered the Mediterranean. The youngest son of Pompey Magnus was likely a competent ruler, given that he held Sicily and Sardinia against the Triumvirate with no internal attempts to unseat him. He did blockade the city of Rome from its grain supply to force the triumvirs to negotiate with him, but the characterization of him as a monster is unfair.\n\n-Octavian being a great military leader. All evidence points to the contrary: three great victories often are attributed to him, and we shall examine them. At Mutina, where pro-Senate forces fought Mark Antony in the chaos after Caesar\u2019s death, Octavian was a general, but was subordinate to two other men who did much of the real leadership. These two were killed in battle, however, so Octavian gets the credit. At Philippi, where Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Antony and Octavian, Octavian\u2019s forces were overrun by Brutus\u2019 while, a little ways away, Antony destroyed Cassius\u2019 army. When Octavian\u2019s camp was overrun, he was found to not even be present; he had claimed illness the night before and stayed away from the battle. Antony had to bring his own troops around to defeat Brutus. And finally, Actium, where Antony and Cleopatra were defeated not by Octavian, but his more capable subordinate, Marcus Agrippa. Agrippa was known for his engineering and architectural skill, but was also a valuable commander (he was the man who defeated Sextus Pompey at sea while Lepidus took his territory by land). Agrippa organized the fleet at Actium and was the one to lead them to victory.\n\nA lot of this was instilled by Augustus\u2019 rather successful record destroying once he became ruler and no one having enough power to challenge him."}, {"score": 1172, "id": "eo4ioey", "text": "That you need to eat three (or more) large meals per day to be happy and healthy.

Lars was somewhere in his late 30s, tall, ruggedly handsome with one of those faces that just exudes character. He was dressed like an old-timey prospector and carried a huge, hand-made leather rucksack. \n\nLars had hiked in to the festival without purchasing a ticket. He walked 10 hours through uncut woods, hiked over a mountain and then swam across a river just to get there. \n\nLars had never taken psychedelics before the night I met him, so of course he thought it would be a good idea to take 4 hits of LSD. \n\nSecurity escorted Lars into the space (a large, secluded area near the center of the festival full of hammocks, tents, art supplies, snacks and a committed staff of wonderful, caring people), and from the moment he saw me, he was imprinted on me like a baby duckling. He literally didn't leave my side for the next 8 hours as I talked him off the psychedelic precipice. At one point I had to literally go into a porta-potty with him, as the thought of being without me for even one minute was too much for his fragile psyche to bear. \n\nLars was, and still is, one of the most interesting people I'd ever met. We talked a lot, and while he mostly went in circles, they were ever expanding concentric circles, and so in time I learned a little bit more about him with each cycle. He had this little hand gesture kind of like little tiny karate-chops he'd do every so often to accentuate a point, accompanied by this kind of \"tch tch tch\" sound. He was very intense, but mostly just wanted someone to see him and hear him. He really needed me to understand where he was coming from, and I was only too happy to oblige him. \n\nLars grew up in Sweden, and came from a broken home. He was for a time the Swedish national youth archery champion. He was also a member of Sweden's version of the Navy Seals, though was very cagey about his time in the service. He left Sweden after the death of his mother (this part was unclear, but she was possible murdered by his father) and eventually made his way to Canada. In Canada he lived the life of a true man of the wilds. He had an old Dodge pickup he'd made a custom camper for, and he traveled around the back country, hunting and living off the land. He made literally everything he needed for his life himself. He made bows, he made clothes, he made shoes, he made pots and pans. If Lars needed something, there wasn't a damn way in hell he was going to a store to buy it when he could damn well make it himself. He also had a Donkey that he sometimes traveled with that seemed to be his one true friend in the world. \n\nI found out later that Lars is also one of the most amazing landscape photographers I've ever seen. I won't share a link to his work as I don't want to out his real identity, but trust me, the dude's work is fucking spectacular. The way he uses color, and the scenery he finds in his wild-man travels are truly stunning. Printed large format, his photographs could easily grace the walls of any high-end gallery, though of course Lars thinks selling art for money is unseemly. \n\nLars and I spent near 8 hours together, him becoming a little more lucid with each passing hour. He eventually decided he was ready to take a nap in one of the hammocks and after exchanging contact details he thanked me for \"saving his life\" (I did no such thing) and fell into the blissful sleep of a man who'd done battle with his demons and come out the other side mostly intact. \n\nI saw Lars in the real world a few years after our night together. We'd stayed in touch and eventually he was in the city where I live and we met for a walk. He was just as interesting as I remember, and wanted me to buy this abandoned old hotel he'd found in some small town in the middle of nowhere so he could turn it into an art gallery or something.

She leaned close to my face and said \"We hope YOU have a nice day.\"\n\nWell she knew what she was talking about I guess. I went to the beach and brought my little transistor radio and my towel and lay down on the beach. I first noticed the music was coming out of my radio in circles, directly into my ears and seemed to go on forever. It sounded wonderful. Witchy Tai To https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg9LT4qR_Dw was playing and I suddenly heard the most wonderfully magical sound I had ever heard. I sat up and looked to see what was causing it. It was the sound of some car keys in the hand of someone walking by. I looked out on the ocean and noticed that the breakers were coming in like pink cotton candy. \n\nI freaked a little noticing that things weren't real at all. I worried about myself at this point because I didn't know what was in the cigarette that I only took took puffs on. I saw a cop down the beach and considered , for a moment, turning myself in to him. At this point the VOICE returned in my head and said **\"You know what's wrong with you, dude? You don't like people.\"**\n\nI decided to go the hamburger stand and get some coffee and food, thinking this would counteract whatever I had inhaled. There was a line of 8 or so people. I turned my face away from everyone in line thinking that if they could see it they would immediately know what I was experiencing.\n\nOh yeah, almost forgot, as I was walking to the refreshment stand I noticed that I was sort of floating. My feet didn't seem to be touching the ground.\n\nWhile I was in line I accidentally brushed up against the person standing directly in front of me. the physical sensation was like a wave washing over my body and I nearly had an orgasm. I turned to peek at who it was that felt so good, It was a big fat hairy guy standing there.\n\nI drank 3 cups of coffee and had 2 hot dogs and went back down to my towel on the beach. My radio was gone. It had been stolen..\n\nI don't actually remember how long I lay there but the effects wore off by sunset and I drove myself home.\n\nI don't know what was in the cigarette. It smelled like pot, but obviously was soaked in something else. I have asked some friends about it and they said it sounded like PCP or some really good grass.\n\nThat is my only experience with any hallucinogens this lifetime. I never smoked much pot either.

I have literally copied it and pasted it in my google notes and it gives me immense hope to stay alive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\" I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.  \nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.  \nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  \nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  \nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  \nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves.

Some of them would hook us up with free fries or sodas, that kind of thing, and every now and again if things were slow, they'd sit at our booth with us. One of the people who would hang out with us was Charles.\n\nCharles was an older guy in his 50s who was very nice to my friends and me, but he was a little... creepy. He would never get overt about it, but he definitely embraced the whole 'creepy uncle' persona, maybe even being a little tongue-in-cheek about it. He'd tell the girls in my group how pretty they were, and how he wished he was still young, that sort of thing. Reading between the lines, he was telling them he wished he could have sex with them. BUT THIS IS NOT GOING WHERE YOU THINK IT IS. I'm just setting the stage, y'all. \n\nThe guy was a little weird, but he *was* a nice guy to us. All the same, I remember telling people \"Charles has a secret. He's in his fifties, slinging coffee at an all-night restaurant, but he comes off as educated and sort of worldly. He talks about traveling and living well --  I don't know what it is, but Charles is damaged. I bet he killed somebody or something.\" I was convinced that the \"nice guy\" bit was a cover for something dark.\n\nUH, YEAH.\n\nSo as my group got older, people came and went, some of us fell out with others, some of us got real jobs and couldn't stay up until 4:00am at a Denny's, and we eventually stopped hanging out there. Never really gave Charles much thought after that, for YEARS.\n\nThen I saw Charles on the news.\n\nTurns out Charles was Charles Rothenberg, a man who, in 1983, was going through a bad divorce. In what I understand was originally intended to be a murder-suicide, he drugged his six-year-old son David, doused the boy in kerosene, and lit him on fire. \n\nDavid survived, but was horribly scarred for the rest of his life. Charles continued to get into criminal trouble, and was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison as a result of California's \"Three Strikes\" law. He's still in prison today, but in the late '90s he changed his name to \"Charley Charles,\" because sure, why not.\n\nIn 1988 there was a TV movie based on the incident called \"David,\" which starred Bernadette Peters as his mother.\n\nMeanwhile his son David became one of Michael Jackson's child-friends and eventually an artist. \n\nWhen he was 19, he visited Charles in prison, apparently reading a prepared statement to him: \n\n\"Charles, you are not my father. You are an impostor. Parents don't hinder their children from experiencing a normal childhood. I wish that you could experience the trauma and pain that I have gone through.\"\n\nAfterward, David told the press \"He wanted me to know that he loved me. The last thing I said was, 'No you don't.' And I walked out.\"\n\nIn a somewhat bizarre turn, David later legally changed his own name to \"Dave Dave,\" mirroring the \"Charley Charles\" name his father adopted. I have no idea if this is coincidental somehow, but the irony is not lost on me, that's for sure.\n\nDave Dave even appeared on the Larry King show to talk about Michael Jackson when he died. If I recall correctly, he defended Jackson against the reports of child molestation and denied he was a victim of Jackson's. \n\nUnfortunately Dave Dave himself passed away last year, at the age of 42 -- his ongoing medical issues, which were the result of his burn injuries, eventually killed him. And in my opinion, that means Charles was ultimately successful in murdering his son.\n\nSo, yeah. I called it -- Charles was harboring something dark when he was getting free fries for my friends and telling the girls how pretty they were.

We both agreed that I should do the timing, as I was more confident about it (which makes little sense thinking about it now), and that he wanted to remove the spark plugs. When he was taking out the 1st plug, I noticed that he wasn't very careful about it. \n\nFor those of you who don't know much about cars, spark plugs are made of ceramic and metal, and the ceramic is easy to snap if you're not careful, and when it does, little pieces of ceramic will end up falling inside the cylinder, which, if the car is started, can cause *serious* damage to your engine.\n\nAnyways, I tell Ryan that he should be careful about taking out the spark plugs. He just says \"Nah nah man it's fine, they're made of metal.\"\nI didn't reply as I noticed that he didn't give a shit about the job. So he unscrews the 2nd spark plug and pulls really hard as he can't fully undo it, and right there, I hear the spark plug snap in half. And to top it off, the entire ceramic part of the spark plug fell inside the cylinder. I immediately told him to tell the tutor, which he of course didn't. \n\nSo then after he moves away from the car, our tutor tells us to move the car to a different spot. I give Ryan the keys and say \"Go on then\", as I didn't have my license then.

Since I had zero filter at that moment, I blurted out, \"Brianna. It isn't you. It's your dad. He's a child molester, I can tell just by looking at him.\" As soon as I said it, everything changed. I apologized, that didn't work of course. Both of my best girlfriends dumped me that day. I still had a solid best friend, but I had to get myself a new group for sure.

Don't flush 100k down the drain for an art history degree.\n* On that note, if you're planning on going to college, start applying for scholarships early. Even if you're extremely fortunate and your family is covering your tuition, start applying for scholarships. Student loans may seem like some distant problem, but you'll curse the ever loving fuck out of your past (current) self if you don't start taking some steps to mitigate needing loans.\n   * If your family is covering your tuition through a 529 plan, whatever is leftover goes to you at the end of college.

Parents left town for a few days and I had some friends come over. Night starts off normal we play some video games and all is well. 2 of my friends need to use the bathroom so one goes down stairs and one stays upstairs since theres 2 bathrooms in the house. First friend comes back from the bathroom and says \" yea yes really funny guys\" to the 3 of us that are in the room. We have no idea what he talking about. He said \"banging on the door and making weird sounds while I'm taking a piss, soooooo funny.\" We are all genuinely confused as we haven't moved. He doesn't believe us but sits down and rejoins the group. Now the second friend comes back from downstairs and has a similar complaint. He says we were bouncing a ball, shuffling things around laughing outside the door and heard us run off when the toilet flushed. We again are confused especially since there weren't enough of us to mess with both of them at the same time. Conversation kind of drops but neither seem convinced we did nothing\n\nA couple hours go by and for some reason the conversation comes up again. We deny it they dpnt believe it. Eventually that turns into jokes a out ghosts and how we disturbed them when the house was remodeled(I was about 13 when we started remodeling). Jokes continue and someone said, \" ah come on now you cant really believe that ghosts exist?\" And everyone is like nahh they probably dont. On the other side of the room is a single-fold closet door and right as we said that this door explodes open so violently that the folds slam together and bounce almost back shut. We immediately end that conversation, flip every light in the house on and no one dared to touch that door.

I said sure. \n\nAfter it kicks in we go for a walk, we were talking about the constellations and space for a while, but then I noticed she got quiet. I had my eyes glued to the sky for the entire walk, so I look over... And she's gone.

Get back to her apartment, knock on the door, and some guy answers the door. Keep in mind this was like 4am at this point. Some guy answers and I ask if he knew Sapphire and described her. He said he had no clue who I was talking about and to just go home.

Oddly enough I never got freaked out being completely alone in a remote cemetery, in the middle of the night, surrounded by dense woods on all sides. It was actually kind of peaceful, to be honest.\n\nHowever, one night I was patrolling near the perimeter fence where some of the oldest headstones are, when I heard the sound of a woman humming. I followed the sound and noticed a light glowing through the vines and brush of a large tree. As I approached, I could literally feel my hair beginning to lift as if there was an electric current in the air.\n\nI pushed aside the brush and what I saw nearly took my breath away. It was an old, weathered headstone with a large cross etched into the marble. Only the cross was glowing a bright, vivid blue, like a neon bulb. The humming was also suddenly much louder and had a weird plurality to it, like it was coming from hundreds of voices at once.\n\nNeedless to say, I freaked the fuck out. I screamed like a scared little girl and sprinted back to the parking lot. I radioed the guard who was supposed to relieve me and forced him to come early, then spent the rest of my shift in the cab of his truck. I don't think he believed me, but he stayed in his truck and didn't go out on patrol until the sun was fully up.\n\nA few days later, I worked up the nerve to return to the grave (during the day, of course). As I suspected, in the light of day it was a completely mundane headstone. There was no name, only the aforementioned cross. I ran my hands over the stone and checked to see if maybe there was some sort of hidden light source or solar panel, but no, it was just plain, solid, unremarkable stone. The humming was gone, too.\n\nI eventually returned to my normal shift, but never again experienced anything out of the ordinary. I never learned whose grave that was, either, but I find myself thinking about it from time to time.

Home of the Joshua Tree National Park (those of us that are older call it \"The Monument\" as it was that before National Parkdom). I was in my early 20's at the time of this, which was approximately 14 years ago, and was the only one with a car and a license.\nGrowing up in a small desert town leaves you will limited options for fun and we would make use of the park. Occasionally, maybe once a week or so, a group of us would pile in to the station wagon with beer, smokes and a mix tape and drive through the park late at night. An empty road, so dark and quite other than the loud group of guys in a red Mercury driving fast from one enterance to another. Hours would go by each time as we drove the long desolate road and stopped at various rocks we liked to climb.\nAnd I can't understate how desolate it was. How alone. No other cars, no lights... except the occasional road work sign when warranted. Hell, that was exactly what we thought it was....\n\nThis trip started like every other, except maybe more of us than usual. Crammed in that car, windows down as I chain smoked and drove a good 20mph over the speed limit, gravel spitting up as we had a good time. Shortly in to the trip I saw a light. A blue light. Possibly (and it was) miles and miles ahead. That is the thing about dark, light is free to shine. I remember saying something about having to slow down at some point ahead, must be some road construction left by itself up ahead. Had to be a sign, the light hadn't moved.\nWe continued for a few miles to one of our favorite stops and got out. We climbed for a while, maybe 45 minutes or so. Drank a little. Joked. The norm. Then we piled back in and continued.\nLet me be clear, this light never moved and we had already been about an hour in to our adventure.\nWhy would the sign have a BLUE light??\nAs we approached the light I started to slow.... and slowed more and more as we approached the source.\nIt wasn't a sign, it wasn't a car, it wasn't a UFO.\nStanding on the side of the road, facing towards us unmoving for over an hour at this point, was a man. A pale white man, white beard, dirty old miner clothing with an old mining helmet and a pickaxe. His light giving off an unnatural blue light. His face blank but he stared at us, directly at all of us. We sped up and as we drove by faster, his head turning to keep pace with us as we left. His light visible, unmoving once again, facing us the entire trip out.\n\nI remember looking at the car clock shortly after passing him, it was damn near exactly 1:00 AM when we passed him. We never saw a car, hell.. a horse, any way for this old sickly pale miner to get in to the park, nor any reason for him to be there. Worst of all we estimated that this miner had to have been standing there, facing us, for at least an hour and a half never moving. Not once did that light flicker as if he looked down for a moment, or turned his head... He just stood there staring down a road at a car full of dumbasses.\n\nWe never saw him again. However, a couple of years ago I decided to check to see if anyone experienced the same. I found one other story of a couple that saw him near where we did. Standing there, staring late at night.\n\nAs a man I wish we would have stopped. Even if it would have been the most horrifying thing ever, I wish we would have stopped because I honestly believe there was a ghost of a dead miner out in that park and I would know for sure today."}, {"score": 12414, "id": "eotz4s2", "text": "In the same room of my old house, I have seen a convulsed face floating outside my window, my brother has also seen it too.

I've worked with her on various occasions, often changing between working the shop with her and doing construction with my dad. For awhile, she ran her business a few towns over with my best friend's dad, and the business was ok, but didn't make enough to support the both of them.\n\nWell, a few years back, she sold her ownership to him, and just boxed up some of her things from the shop to bring home. My dad, however, surprised her and rented her a building in our home town so she could run her OWN shop. She quickly brought everything there and began unpacking. \n\nWhile unpacking, I found an old Ouiji board from an estate sale she had bought out. I showed her, we joked about the creepyness of it, and she said when she'd gotten it, her coworker had jokingly played with it to tease her (our family isn't super religious, but we ain't about tempting demons lol). She thought he'd thrown it away, but apparently he'd snuck it into her stuff as a final prank. So, we laughed, and she tossed it in the garbage pile.\n\nA few months later, I was running the front desk when she brought a box of antiques to price down from the attic. We began going through it and what happened to be in the bottom of the box? The Ouiji board, still in it's cardboard case, planchette underneath. I recognized it as the same one (the box had the same tears and dents I remembered). Mom and I looked at each other, and after much debating, threw it away... again.\n\nWell, in about 2017, mom stopped opening the shop (we weren't making too much while open), and instead started buying out estate sales or helping them run it, then buying what was left over to take to the shop (which we still owned). It became a storage house for antiques she hoped to one day sell. \n\nThis last week (May 20th I believe?) She asked me to help buckle down and clear out damaged junk from the shop. We began going through boxes and boxes and moving them to a trailer to take to a garage sale location. As I was shuffling a box through to the back area to load it, I heard my mother shout, \"No. F***ING. WAY.\" I thought maybe she'd been bitten by a spider or found something valuable, so I set the box down and rushed back to her. What I saw sent a chill down my spine. \n\nIn the back room where she was, the back wall was lined with shelves, and there were clothing racks and boxes of clothes stacked in front of it. After moving the boxes, the shelves were in clear view. Most were cluttered with knick knacks or such. But on the bottom shelf, centered and all alone there sat a familiar board-game sized cardboard box. We stared at it, then each other. Neither of us said a word. We pulled it out and sure enough, it was the SAME DAMNED BOX. The corners were torn. The sides Were scratched. Same one. I'd seen it thrown out twice before, yet here it was. \n\nWe tried to tell my dad, but he isn't superstitious. My brother didn't believe us. They assume it's a separate game, and part of me wants to think so too. But I've seen that box too closely too many times. I know it's the same one. \n\nTl;Dr - Mom opens her own antique shop and we find a Ouiji board and throw it out. Then find it again and throw it out.

Whenever she wanted me to come up, she would blink the light and I have to run upstairs immediately. I couldn't finish my last task, like finishing the sentence I was just writing or wearing a shirt because I was about to get dressed. If I wouldn't be there 10 sec after the blink signal I would have consequences reaching from losing internet/my laptop for a few hours/days, or being force fed or having mandatory \"family time\", because I would need to learn respect. Family time was me sitting in the living room, not allowed to move or do anything than sit and stare (not even reading a book or writing my diary), while uncle and aunt would belittle me and say hurtful things to me. The signal was happening up to every half hour. I am still sensitive to lights.\n\nI didn't want to eat meat for ethical reasons. I didn't make a big thing out of it. I just told her she wouldn't have to buy extra meat for me and I would be okay with the veggies. That's when she started to add bacon pieces and eggs into the veggies. \n\nWhen I had a different opinion than her or her fat loser husband, she would bend my arms so I couldn't move, hold a mirror inches away from my face and let me repeat to myself \"I am a liar. I am wrong. [Aunt] is right and I'm a liar.\" until she would be satisfied. Different opinions would mean stuff like once I came home from school, they wanted to know what I learned today. I was telling them about my philosophy class, and started my sentence with \"so first we assume that humans, as all animals...\". \"DID YOU JUST CALL US ANIMALS? YOU HAVE NO RESPECT! THOU SHALT NOT LIE!\". This particular argument dragged until the evening.\n\n\nMy door to my bedroom was broken, because she kicked it in. I asked her if we could repair it. The answer was no, because otherwise she couldn't just enter because I surely would lock it. The door was always a crack wide open. I asked to get a magnet, so at least it would click close. After a few weeks I got one.\n\nI am very skinny and she is very fat and old. I don't like to show my body around, so I like to wear tights when I wear skirts and t-shirt that go all up to my neck, so nobody could see my bones. She would think, that I was making fun of her and feel better than her for having a \"perfect body\". She would force me to strip down in the hallway, where windows were to the street, because I was body shaming her by covering mine up. I wasn't allowed to wear tights. She would make fun of me for wearing my skirts low, so they would cover more of my boney legs. Once I was wearing a blouse and was about to leave for school. The blouse was wrinkled so she wanted to iron it real quick. She told me to take it off, so I wanted to go to my room and switch to a shirt until the blouse was ironed. I wasn't allowed to do that. I had to strip to my bra in the hallway (where all neighbors could've seen me). I was holding my hands up to my chest and tried to stand in a doorway, so I couldn't be seen. When she noticed that, she forced my hands down and let me stand in front of our glass door. Because I did that for shaming her body, she said, and I shouldn't be so ignorant.\n\nShe force fed me. I was eating very little, but I never was anorexic or anything. She would cook extra much and let me having to eat more than I could, until I felt like puking. I gained 10kg in a year. That was the time when I tried to be bulemic, but jokes on me, I can't puke. No matter how much I press back there or force my finger or toothbrush down, it doesn't work. I gag a lot, but nothing comes up. Believe me, I tried. So I started to drink a lot of alcohol, because i would always puke from that.\n\nI ended up in the hospital twice for alcohol poisoning during my time at hers. I started self harm. Not cutting. Not my arms, because she would see. I would scratch my legs with my fingernails and/or scissors, until I had raw and fleshy wounds. Then I would touch those wounds as often as I could with dirty hands so they would get infected and crusty from pus. I wanted to have maximum pain throughout the day. In the summer, it was smelly.\n\nDuring my time there I lost track of all my hobbies. Before I read several books per week. I played guitar and piano. I had a very solidly kept diary. I learned a bit of programming myself. I drew so much. I really wanted to go to art school. Being called up several times a day interrupted everything I loved. Bit by bit I gave up everything and started to just sit on my laptop mindlessly all day, because I was just waiting for the next time it would blink.\n\nI ran away two times and lived among some punks in some occupied spaces, because it was better than living in constant fear.\n\nI stood behind her with a knife in my hand too often to count. I once lifted it and was seconds away from stabbing her ugly fat back, when she turned around.\n\nI told her I want to see a therapist. She didn't allow me that because \"WE are not sick\". We, as in the family. Because only sick weirdos go to therapists.\n\nShe didn't allow me to have hobbies. Aty parents place I was a good dancer. I was in a dancing group for 4 years and my whole life evolved around it. It was the only place I had friends. My aunt forbid me, because I had to focus on family first. If I would behave, I could join a dancing group. Going behind her back didn't work, because she would track my school bus and control that I would be home on time. My school friends often hung out after school. I wasn't allowed to.\n\nMy school friends would always hang out at this bar every Friday. I lived in a village, so I asked my aunt and uncle to drive me there. They did it. I always asked them to drop me off a bit further down the road (like every teenager I guess). After a few weeks my uncle grabbed me by my shoulders, face to face inches away and whispered that he knew I was a looser who didn't have friends. He knew, that I was just just a poor ugly girl drinking alone on that park bench where he drops me off whole night.\n\nI moved out when I was 18.\n\nAll the time I was telling my parents and teachers about what I experience at home. But no one believed me, because my aunt told them I was just a raging teenager. Nobody believed me. I know this isn't even the worst what people experience. There are people who had it way worse. I never believed I was abused until my therapist told me it was definitely legit to call it like that.

As I figured, a lot of people wouldn't believe it (thus the theme of the thread.) Little follow up to what all I can remember is that my dad instantly switched from working nights to working days so he could be home at night if anything else happened. A few months later my parents finally saved up enough money to move into a much better neighborhood. Ever since I moved out of that area I never had any problems, other than the night terrors, since then.I will post a picture of the house below. Mind you the surround houses drastically changed in appearance over the past like 20 odd years, but the old house still remotely looks the same. (Its the puke green colored house)  \n[https://imgur.com/a/eOdtxq8](https://imgur.com/a/eOdtxq8)\n\nOnly my mom ever believed me about this, unfortunately she is no longer alive so I cannot ask her for anymore details than what I have been told while growing up. My dad just never wants to talk about what happened.\n\nI used to live in this rented house near an appliance store from birth up until I was six years old. I am 24 now and out of the military, if that tells you how long ago this was. Since it was a small house and I was the younger sibling, and my dad worked nights, I ended up sleeping in my parents room until we moved out. It should be noted that one side of my bed was against a wall, and the other facing the doorway.  \nI remember having this Cookie Monster plush that I was obsessed with and would never go to sleep without it. If my mom ever tucked me in without it I would throw a tantrum until I had my best friend.  \nThings started to change when I was about to turn four though. My mom would wake up and notice I would be sleeping without the plush and that it would be under my bed. Not thinking much of it, she would just put it back in my bed and let me continue sleeping.  \nThis kept going on for a couple of weeks until my mom finally decided to ask me about why Cookie Monster would always be under my bed when she would wake up. I remember saying something along the lines of \"He is my friend, he talks to me and likes to walk around at night.\" or something of that matter.  \nFrom my perspective, I knew I was talking to Cookie Monster because I could see his eyes. You know how he has those big white eyes that stick out. He would talk to me at night and help me go back to sleep when I was scared.  \nMy mom played it off as my overactive child's imagination, but it slowly was about to get worse.Over the course of the next couple of months I would have night terrors. No, not simple nightmares. I am talking about full blown night terrors, so bad to the point I would stiffen up and do nothing but scream as my mom tried to rock me back to sleep. This went on for almost every single night.They were so scarring on younger me that to this day I remember what they were about. I would be laying in bed at night when my Cookie Monster plush would came to life, drag me out of my bed, and pull me under it to eat me. Shit, I never stopped getting these dreams until I was 14 that is how scarring they were.  \nAbout a year from moving out of the house and into a better place, my mom would learn the truth behind the whole ordeal. She woke up to some noises one night and heard me out in the living room talking to Cookie Monster.  \nNow you might expecting that I am going to say she saw me talking to the plush, but you are wrong.  \nYou might expect me to say that I was laying in my bed and only the plush was out in the other room, but you are wrong.  \nBut reality is much, much scarier than any fictional story.\n\nWhat she saw instead, is much worse than any paranormal activity shit you could ever see in any move theater, for instead of a possessed doll, she saw me standing there, talking to the dark.My mom instinctively turned on the light and as soon as she did, two old guys went running out of the now wide open front door.The only thing I remember from that night was my mom holding onto me for dear life as my dad and the police rushed to the house.The thing that scares me to this day is not the fact that I was talking to two random strangers that night.  \nWhat scares me to this day, is that I was talking to these people for months without knowing it. I was talking to the people who were constantly breaking into my house every night.

When i was four my family moved into a Victorian villa that was built in 1860. Lovely place, beautiful big garden - happy days! \n\nThat was, until what i like to refer to as The Incident of the Window. \n\nSo, one afternoon small me was sat under the window in the ground floor living room playing with some Barbis. Mum is in another room, and no one else is in. No-one else should be outside either, may i point out!\n\nBut lo\u2019 and behold, i look up to notice someone walking along the front of the house toward the window i am sat under. Panic ensues at this point, but its hard to describe. While i was definitely a shy child, i wasn\u2019t terrified of general people in the public sphere. All i can remember is this really strong feeling of \u201cwrongness\u201d, so i dipped behind the armchair that faced away from the direction the gentleman was walking and hid.\n\nAfter a bit i peek around the side of the chair to see if its safe to come out yet, and see a man passing the window. He lifts his hat at me and smiles, then continues on his way. i howl for my mum!\n\nAfter a mad dash through to the sitting room, and my garbled explanation of the problem, she goes outside to obviously find nobody there. She checks our wash house, the summer house and the garage but they are all free of middle aged men in jaunty hats. She assumes someone has come down the drive, which is long and cuts around the side of the building with a separate entrance, assuming it was a short cut off the street and left when they realised their mistake.\n\nadult me finds this story pretty implausible but heyho, we say what we need to to placate kids eh?! And in the past a couple of people had made that mistake, only they realised and turned back / apologised long before reaching the far windows! \n\nAnyway, i am assured its nothing to worry about and go back to days whiling away the merry childhood hours doing random crap in this room by that window. \n\nHOWEVER!! Later in that same week the *same man* appears again! (How bad aaare his directions, you might well ask). \n\nThis time mum and i are alone again, but with the important difference she is doing the dishes in the kitchen next door and is stood in front of the window: looking out. She has seen nobody go past, but at my shout of \u201cthat funny looking man is back!\u201d she bolts out the door in a flash - to find absolutely no-one there. A fact she already expects because she has seen nobody go past the entire time she has been in the kitchen. Again, she checks all the out buildings - and finds nothing.\n\nOnce again she attempts to reassure me that it is probably nothing to worry about; that it probably wasn\u2019t the same man and that they will put something on the drive to make clear it isn\u2019t a passage for the public. I insist doggedly to anyone who will listen that this was the same man, and that he looked funny.\n\nEventually my grandma, who is a big believer in the supernatural, came to stay with us and the whole incident is brought up. By this point i no longer willingly go anywhere near windows on that side of the house and live in general terror of people looking in at me. She asks me to describe who i saw. \n\nAt this point i feel i should mention how utterly obsessed with the Victorian period I was for my entire childhood. I was forever playing \u201colden days\u201d set then, i had loads of dressing up clothes of it, and collected lots of children\u2019s tv or books set in, or about, the period. \n\nYou can probably see where this is going, but i described a Victorian man\u2019s get up, which my grandma recognised instantly. She said she thought it was the old gardener by the style of dress i explained, down to the hat, and that she thought it was just his way of letting us know he was happy a new family had come to live there. Her and my mum thought that was a lovely heart warming tale, but i have spent the rest of my life terrified of it - meanwhile anyone else who ever heard the story either believes the same man stupidly walked down that drive by mistake twice in one week, or that i fell asleep and dreamt it. Twice in one week tho?  \n\n** edit: just clarifying, i realise people do have recurring dreams. Its the notion of me falling asleep, while sat on the floor next to a table playing with toys,  twice at a random time of day in a week that i would say is unlikely to me! \n\nAlso, not saying it was def a ghost.

Which turned out to be a video he recorded on his phone.  He proceeded to tell me that he left it on his bed and forgot about it.

I remembered being a little unnerved by this.  Then late into the video, he asked if I saw it.  I said *saw what*.  He then backed tracked, and pointed to a mask he had sitting on top of his tower computer.  Something that I completely overlooked when watching his video.  Then he said to watch it. \n\nI saw this mask-head thing go up and down very, very slowly. He even scrolled back and forth in the progress bar and made sure that I saw it.

This house is estimated to have been built sometime in the 1700's ( not that uncommon in the English countryside) the family there consisted of a husband, wife and 3 kids between the ages of 3-5. A very important detail is that one of their kids died at teenager age, maybe 14 based on pictures (mum never asked how, she felt too disrespectful to ask) the husband was a bit strange, anti social, career focused. He was mostly at work so mum and I didn't see him often. The wife was maybe mid 20's, very chatty and friendly and she loved her kids. The fact they were such a normal family makes the events of this story worse. So, mum was asked to clean the 3 floors of the house. However, the wife told mum that on the 3rd floor is where the guest rooms are and they collect a lot of cobwebs. (old house, completely normal) and so they only need cleaning once a month. This is where things get weird...\n\nShe was given strict instructions not to enter the room 3rd along the hallway on the 3rd floor. That was their dead sons room and they want it left completely alone. Okay, sure...\n\nThe first time she did the new cleaning job at this house, she came home early in absolute hysterics. Now, this is a woman who was a carer for years, she's held many dead bodies and guts in her time. So not a lot affects this woman, she's a tough mum. I've never seen anything affect her like this day she came home.\n\nShe said as soon as she climbed those stairs to the 3rd floor, everything went quiet and freezing cold. Chalking it up to old creepy house, she pressed on. She opened up the door to the hallway that leads to the 6 guest rooms. Upon walking in, the 3rd and 4th door opens inwards and she hears a young child giggling, and a child on a tricycle comes out the 3rd door and wheels round to the 4th. My mum dropped the hoover and ran the fuck out of there. She asked her other employee to come up with her. They didn't see the boy again, but the atmosphere was still there. They peeked into the 3rd room (my mum has huge balls and morbid curiosity that overrides her fear) and she said it looked like a murder scene. There was dried brown blood on what looked like a normal kids room, on the covers of the bed, the carpet etc but she said the worse part was turning to the wall and seeing \"help me\" scrawn into the wall in fresher blood than the rest. Mum and employee got the fuck out of there. They immediately went downstairs to the wife, and just as she was about to say \" I'm not cleaning the 3rd floor at all, you need to find someone else.\" the wife looked to her and said\n\n\" I can tell you went up to the 3rd floor, I understand you don't want to clean up there, none of the cleaning companies we've hired will go up there. We usually do it ourself. \"\n\nUpon hearing this story from mum I was thinking hoooly shit. I dont understand how this family uses those rooms as GUEST ROOMS! As in, friends and family stay in those rooms over Christmas etc. \n\nA few months later, she was scheduled to do that house alone, she practically begged me to come along. Now it's not uncommon I helped out at the time because I loved her and supported her business but in all honesty I was shit scared. She even had to offer me payment before I considered.\n\nSo upon arriving I immediately hate this house. Huge long driveway, massive courtyard in front of the house. Old rotting wood supports, all windows facing outwards towards the courtyard where we park the van. I can see those 3rd floor windows and I am extremely nauseous. The 3rd floor windows are completely black, but my mum was certain they didn't have curtains. Oookay.\n\nSo, I start cleaning, and the first thing I noticed is that there are hidden cameras everywhere. I mean, FUCKING EVERYWHERE. maybe mum didn't spot them because she doesnt know what's she's looking for ( she's a bit old bless her) but I could see little glowing lights where they were on and recording, they were very well hidden mind you, I can't be certain I found all of them but in the whole house I counted 130 cameras. 130. ONE HUNDRED, AND FUCKING THIRTY CAMERAS HAVE BEEN RECORDING MUM AND ALL HER EMPLOYEES ( INCLUDING ME) FOR MONTHS. WHAT THE FUCK. Upon this discovery, I immediately told mum and she went apeshit at the wife, who was the only person present. Mum hated being filmed while doing her job, and it's not uncommon people record cleaners to make sure they don't steal, but not 130 fucking cameras. This is where the story gets worse than that creepy upstairs... The wife had no fucking clue what we were on about. What the fuck. We went around the house and I pointed them all out for mum and the wife. The wife was gobsmacked at this. We had to leave for the day as we had finished, and the wife said she'd have words with her husband when he got home.\n\nSo.. The next week I come with mum again and as soon as we greet the wife we know something is very wrong today. The wife is teary eyed and has a weak voice. She asks us to sit down in the kitchen for a talk. She says she confronted the husband and found out a lot of things. Firstly, all these cameras went to a random, locked room where the husband had a mini cctv setup where he held all the footage, and he was forced to show the wife what recordings were stored. Ooh boy. There were thousands of trimmed videos of my mum cleaning, bending over, working and were extremely perverted, not only that, but he saved recordings of his own kids undressed in their rooms. Oh my god I felt so sick hearing this. She said she was going to the police when he goes away on a trip to avoid more confrontation because she was scared, she was also packing up her and the kids stuff to move to her mums house. She begged my mum not to ever come near the house again and she will pay her to keep this quiet. ( I guess they had a reputation in the area and didnt want word going around? Not sure how you can keep that shit safe??)\n\nTo this day, mum and I have never said a word about what that wife said to us. She said she wont accept any money for bribery, and she will never be in contact again, and that was that. We went in the van, went home and had lunch. We both didn't want to speak and felt so sick. We still haven't spoken about it in full.\n\nBonus, we drove past that hellhole house about 2 years afterwards and we saw a new family playing in the gardens outside the front. \n\nMyself, mum and that employee are the only people who know what we saw. Mum tried telling the story of the room to the rest of the employees and they laughed as if it was a ghost story. She never mentioned that weird fucking husband.

One wing was the actual chapel and the other was living quarters. My mom said multiple exorcisms had been done there and she once watched the double doors to the living quarters fly open and something stomped down some stairs, all during an exorcism. Hell, even when I got there, my other friend I was living with showed me the unused concrete basement and in there was a room that seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, bigger than a closet but smaller than a typical room. The only thing in the room was a symbol painted on the middle of the wall that gave us bad vibes. We googled it and turned out to be a symbol that represented some demon who preferred taking childrens\u2019 souls or some shit (can\u2019t remember exactly what it was).\n\nAnyway, its 1 am and all my roommates are asleep and I decide I\u2019m going to go outside and smoke some weed and look at the moon and listen to some Radiohead to relax myself after work.

Sweetie is so well trained that she will stick to you without a leash and typically scares off packs of coyotes that lurk around. However, as I\u2019m walking towards the forest, Sweetie stops and starts whining and won\u2019t follow me like she usually does so I tell her to come on but alas, Sweetie refuses to go. I take her back to the apartment and have her sit in my bed and she is *shaking* at this point, but stupid me decided it was okay and went back around the garage outside and started walking towards the forest again, but this time I noticed something was walking alongside me (pretty much directly next to me) in my peripheral.\n\nI just kept going until something clicked in my head that said \u201cyou did not imagine that\u201d and I turned to see what was next to me. I shit you not, what I saw was a white figure that was as tall as my waist, and it was wearing a dress, then something whispered in my ear and I took off running into the huge backyard area where I usually smoke.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nAfter smoking a bit and listening to In Rainbows for the thousandth time in my life to calm me down, I decide I had to of imagined it and Sweetie probably just saw a coyote that was bigger than usual.

Drivers can\u2019t read your minds, so signaling will let us know you want to get off the bus. Signaling as we pass your stop is pointless, because...\n\n2. Buses can\u2019t stop on a dime! Don\u2019t step out in front of a bus and expect us to stop safely for you. Also, after getting off the bus, don\u2019t cross in front of us! Either cross behind us or wait for us to pass. It\u2019s too easy for us to run you over. \n\n3. If you see your bus at your stop, board quickly. We are on a schedule and cannot wait around for everyone to lollygag their way to the stop.

If you are on the street in between stops and see a bus you need or want, don\u2019t flag them down and expect them to stop for you. Many times our policies don\u2019t permit us to stop anywhere except a designated bus stop. \n\n6. We are most likely not the last bus that will ever service your stop. So if you miss your bus, or if we leave before you make it to the stop, don\u2019t try to sprint to catch up with us. Wait for the next one! And if you really need to catch my bus at that very moment, BE ON TIME TO THE STOP!\n\n7. When the bus is crowded, please move as far back as you can to allow people to get on the bus. There is no stigma to sitting in the back of the bus. \n\n8. When exiting the bus, use the back doors unless you need special attention offboarding, e.g., if you\u2019re in a wheelchair, use a walker, or otherwise require us to kneel the bus (which can only be done at the front).\n\n9. When boarding a bus with a special needs passenger who is offboarding, WAIT FOR THEM TO GET OFF AND CLEAR THE BUS before you push your way on. \n\n10. Be considerate of other people! This is not your personal limousine. This is public space. Not everyone wants to watch you eat or hear your music or watch your videos. \n\n11. If you clip your nails on my bus, I will kick you the fuck off it. That is just plain disgusting. Take care of your personal hygiene in a proper bathroom somewhere else!\n\n12. If you need help with anything, especially route information, never hesitate to ask the driver. Nine times out of ten, they will be happy to help. \n\n13.

I just had a call the other day where someone complained the bus they rode on was \u201cold and dirty and just trash\u201d.

I feel bad for the people who really need it.  Public transit constantly gets requests for more service, or to expand it to areas where it isn\u2019t, but they can\u2019t because there\u2019s not enough funding.   There\u2019s plenty of money in the economy, but politicians prioritize other things.  Please speak up to your representatives to provide more funding for public transit.

I operated streetcars that functioned like buses (a stop at every block, but they don't stop unless there's demand for it), buses, and light rail trains now. Operators can be kind of petty because we work a somewhat thankless job.\n\n1) If you want terrible service, be sure to remind the operator that he's late. I've gotten stuck in traffic, or stuck behind another train that broke down, or any number of things that I couldn't do a damn thing about. Once I'm on the move again, there's always at least one person who looks at me sternly and taps their watch. I get it, I'm late. The little trip computer has been showing negative numbers for the last fifteen minutes; it's hard to miss. By doing this, I specifically remember you. If there's a point in the future where I'm on time and you're not, I won't wait for you now because you annoyed the hell out of me.\n\n2) If you want great service, bring food. Sealed food is the best. A bottle of soda where the seal hasn't been popped, an unopened bag of chips or whatnot can help a lot.\n\nI'll not even joking when I said I had a regular that brought me a big cookie once, and two weeks later I didn't see him at his usual station. I did, however, see him running up from about a block away. Since he was actually running and had brought me good food, we all waited for him even though it made me a little late. I made up the time quickly enough though.\n\n3) Stop requests are important. If you're on a route that has stops in every block, we're not stopping at each one every time. Pull the cord, push the button, even saying \"next stop, please!\" is enough communication. Standing behind me is not. Do you want a better view of where you're going because you're lost? Do you want the next stop? Or what about the stop after that? If you stand there silently, I know nothing.\n\n4) Hearing music on the bus and train sucks because 99% of time it's not music you like. Shut that shit off, an don't you dare get upset when the operator or another passenger asks you to be a decent human being and turn it off.\n\n5) The trains I run now have very limited rearward visibility from the cab. A lot of stuff happens behind me that I miss. If you see someone unload bodily fluids onto the train, let the operator know. I wouldn't want to ride a train with vomit all over the floor, and I don't expect you all to either.\n\n6) Holding the door for your buddy who is late or was hanging out on the wrong side of the platform is a dick move and I don't know if any train operator who doesn't wish misfortune upon those who do it.\n\nI personally try to limit the amount of misfortune I wish upon these people to \"I hope a bird shits on your head\" but man, if you do this at the wrong time, you could probably bottle my rage and sell it as a renewable energy source."}]}, {"id": "btb5si", "title": "What are some red flags of a bad friendship?", "comments": [{"score": 9295, "id": "eovl7lz", "text": "When they don\u2019t listen to what you have to say."}, {"score": 5264, "id": "eovlmpt", "text": "When they only talk about themselves and don't ask or take any interest in anything about you"}, {"score": 12045, "id": "eovkyqy", "text": "When they only ask you for things but never offer anything in return.

Really, it's a mixed bag for how we can handle these patients.  Ostracizing the parents is only going to build further barriers between provider and kid, so that doesn't help.  Frankly, what has worked best in my experience is to try to understand where the families are coming from, explicitly asking what their thoughts are on vaccines to let them voice their (mis)understandings.  Oftentimes, this is the first time they've been allowed to talk about their questions and concerns regarding vaccines with a trained MD that doesn't just belittle them.

Animal control had captured and destroyed a raccoon that tested positive for rabies on the same street that the mother and child lived on only a day or two prior.  Animal control was actively searching for this raccoon as well since it had apparently just gone up to the house in broad daylight and entered the garage where the kid was playing and bit him before running away.  Obviously this is an extremely high likelihood of another infected animal and the kid needed the rabies vaccine.  \n\nWell the ER doctor had made 2 mistakes.  One, he had not initially referred to it as a \"rabies vaccine\" but rather as a \"series of injections to prevent rabies from infecting the child\".  Most anyone would hear that and suspect \"vaccine\" but apparently the mother had not only never heard of the rabies vaccine, but didn't initially interpret preventive injections as a vaccination either.  She was told the boy would need the first injection as soon as possible and since we had the medicine on site we could do it right away.  The mother consented to the treatment and the physician made the order and went on to explain the procedure to the mother in greater detail to make sure she was properly informed; which is when the he made his second mistake, which was referring to the rabies injections as the rabies vaccine.  \n\nThe security cameras above the nurses stations caught the details but the mother lost her gourd over this.  She screamed at the doctor for so many things.  She accused him of trying to deceive her, that she never would have agreed to the procedure if she knew it was a vaccine.  She said he was trying to poison her child and give him the autism.  She accused him of being a pedophile because he wanted to stick something in her boy.  Finally she accused him of being racist (all three of them are black).  \n\nBy this point other nurses, in hospital security, and a few actual officers are all at the room.

It's one thing to walk around your manicured yard barefoot, but to walk around a rocky campground, at night, with coperheads and rattlesnakes is something that should never be done.\n\nWe were almost done with the doctor when he said he needed to give the boy a tetanus shot. He looked at the boy's medical chart that was loaded on his computer (we had to get physicals to come to the camp, all these were scanned and loaded into a computer so that any boy could go to either of the 2 medical areas and they would be able to look up the info).\n\nThe dr. said he could not give the boy a tetanus shot because the boy never had the initial shot or series. In fact, the kid had never received any shots or vaccines. The doctor was honestly confused as to how the boy had been allowed to come to camp that year. The dad was with us and was basically bragging about how none of his 8 kids were vacinated. The dr ripped him a new one and told him how agonizing and painful lockjaw was. \n\nSo the doctor didn't have the shot that was needed (because everyone was supposed to have already had that prior to coming to camp).

She seems uncertain, shaky, and like she doesn't have a clue about what she's doing. She then takes me back to get my hair washed. She doesn't wet my hair thoroughly and proceeds to shampoo my hair when it isn't even wet. We then get back to the floor, and she starts separating my hair out into sections. After stabbing me with the pins and pulling out my hair, I told her to stop and that I wasn't comfortable letting her cut my hair.\n\nI felt terrible, and this was the only time I ever did something like that. A class instructor gives me a hair trim, and it took him less than 5 minutes. I was out the door.

Even though I'm late and no one will read it.\n\nThis was about 20 years ago.  I was visiting Baltimore for a month, staying about 45 minutes outside of town in Pikeville.\n\nI needed a hair cut, so found Sam's barbershop in the phone book within walking distance, advertising $5 haircuts (first red flag).  I went there, and it was downstairs in anything hair salon (2nd red flag).  I found it downstairs, and there was no one else there (final red flag).\n\nSam was older, but nice, so I sat down and he started cutting and talking.  He proceeded to tell me about his life, including how he emigrated from Poland as an adult to avoid Hitler.  I did some quick mental math, figuring out he had to be (at the youngest) in his very late 80's.  I also began to notice he had to hold himself steady with one hand, while cutting with only one hand.  This meant he couldn't pull the hair up or anything between his fingers, he could just hack away with scissors.  I tried to mentally signal my wife to pull the fire alarm, but she just read her magazine.  I then just resigned myself to my fate, and listened to his story.  To quote Bill from King of the Hill, \"It's only hair.  It'll grow back.\"\n\nHe finally finished.  He didn't ask what I thought, but I said thanks, and gave him $5, plus a $2 tip, which by his reaction was the first tip he'd gotten in about 40 years.\n\nI drove straight to the next barbershop I saw, and when I walked in the barber's eyes got really wide for a second until he could regain his composure.  I said \"It's a little uneven,\u201d to which he replied \u201dYou think?\". I asked him to do what he could, so he cut it down to about 1/4 inch on the sides, and about 1/2 inch on top.  Cost me another $20, but at least it was even.\n\nAll in all, an interesting day.  I was out of town, and enjoyed the low maintenance cut.

I threw my xBox controller mid-game at my roommate, leapt to my feet and said \"Hey man, I have to GO!\" Once I arrived at her apartment and calmed her down I managed to ascertain that it was not her Grandmother who had died, but her goldfish. She said she wanted to have a funeral for her fish. I was...annoyed...but determined to compassionately help her cope because obviously that goldfish MATTERED to her. I recommended she go get cleaned up and take a hot shower to relax, and while she was in there I called up a couple of my friends, and some of her girlfriends. I had a buddy of mine go to the park at the small campus lake and dig a fish grave, I had her girlfriends take her out to lunch, then I got the floating carcass out of the bowl, wrapped it in toilet paper, and placed it in a jewelry box coffin. We went and had a full fish funeral with music and people speaking and Psalm 23 by the lake. Afterward, when we were back at her apartment, she said \"I don't know why you did that, we should've just flushed it.\" We broke up a few weeks later.  \n  \nTL;DR: I was an idiot who made underappreciated grand gestures\n\nEDIT: My first Silver! Thanks kind stranger! I'll use it to buy a life insurance policy on my kid's first goldfish!  \n\nEDIT 2: My wife is going to be THRILLED that my first Reddit Gold was a story about ex girlfriends. Now I have to go figure out how Gold works, lol.\n\nEDIT 3: There's some vitriol in the comments toward the bereaved fish owner. This was 15 years ago, most of us are cringy and foolish at times when we're younger. She's a perfectly delightful person, just not the person for me.

She lived in another state, nevertheless, we started a long distance relationship. Coincidentally, she had just lost her job, so I sent her money every week.

We dated for 4 years while we were in school for Architecture.  Towards the end of our degrees, she started having trouble with her thesis project and asked for help.  In what can only be described as a lengthy period of insanity, I decided to stop working on my own projects and focus entirely on her thesis.  I did everything for her - designs, drawings, models, and write-ups.  Her presentation went flawlessly and she had the top grades in her class.  As a result of staying up all night for weeks at a time and repeatedly delaying my own work, I failed most of my classes and dropped out of school.  She was grateful, and begged me to help her work on her masters degree as well.  No Problem! Got her straight A's and a brand new diploma to add to her collection.  She dumped me on graduation day and immediately began a relationship with someone who understood the importance of self-respect.  I'm not even mad - It was entirely my own doing, and I learned some valuable lessons.  Really expensive fuck up though... cost me about 8 years of my life playing catch-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNEVER put a school relationship before your own success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:  For those of you interested in a followup, here is what happened right after that shit show.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I failed out of school, I tried to re-apply to my Architecture program the following year.  I got a letter in the mail letting me know that my student loans were in default, and I was ineligible for any financial aid.  The news was soul crushing, and I really expected that my life was over.. That's when I seriously considered suicide as a way out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I spent about a year in a complete haze, unable to function properly, not eating and rarely leaving my bed.  I ran out savings, lost my apartment and had to move back into my parents house.  The turning point for me was when I started speaking openly and honestly with my friends about what I was going through, and I credit them with pushing me in the right direction.  I started researching suicide and how to combat negative thoughts, and ultimately came to the conclusion that life is something I want to experience - something interesting might happen eventually, even if things suck right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo move forward, I embraced the fact that I was at rock bottom and convinced myself that there was nothing more I could lose.  While my past self was afraid of failure, the new me said \"fuck it, let's do this.\"  My mission in life became getting back into school, no matter the cost.  So I applied to any job I could, and was fortunate to be accepted at a landscape design company that needed a draftsman. After four years, working 9 hours a day at $12-$16 an hour, I had managed to make enough consecutive payments on my old school loans that they were deemed \"rehabilitated.\"  Please keep in mind that during this time, I was able to live rent free and had minimal payments to bear, so I was extremely fortunate during that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last step was signing up for classes at my old school and taking out new federal loans.  Going back to school as an adult while working full time is tough, but at the same time I feel there's no better way to do it.  I had a new appreciation my education, crushed my classes and graduated within 2 years - I even managed to bring my grades up from a 2.7 to a 3.2 GPA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that's the basic version of what happened.

Those 15-20 minutes felt like more than 30; I had to find my way through the snow to the flower shop. I finally did it: I bought that rose, the biggest and the most beautiful one that was there. I got in class, waited for her with an insane anxiety ( as everyone, almost, in the class, after understanding to who the flower was ment to be given, was cheering on me).\n\nShe comes, I start walking towards her, with the insane anxiety still hanging there, and I give her the rose, in a pretty \"common\" way, but still elegant.

That\u2019s for Americans born between 1946 and 1964. Once these people grew up, they wanted nothing to do with high taxes to support cheap university education, especially. So they drew up the ladder of educational opportunity and more or less said, \u201cScrew you, children and grandchildren! Our own parents gave us these great educational benefits without us taking on any student debt. So we got ours! Now you\u2019re on your own!\u201d\n\nWorld-class infrastructure? That\u2019s for Americans born between 1946 and 1964. Well-kept highways, bridges, tunnels, and subway systems are for young people to use, not old people since most old people are going to be dead soon. Bridges that are well-kept, for example? Those last 50 years, and will mostly benefit the young. So the Baby Boomers also said, \u201cScrew you, children and grandchildren! Our own parents gave us great infrastructure, but that means we have to pay higher taxes to keep this up. But we don\u2019t want to pay for that! Now you\u2019re on your own!\u201d\n\nCheap housing in large cities bursting with economic opportunity? That\u2019s for Americans born between 1946 and 1964. Now that the Baby Boomers are old and have lots of property in these cities\u2014especially nice coastal cities like San Francisco and New York\u2014they don\u2019t want high-density anything because it destroys \u201cthe character of the neighborhood.\u201d The worst of the worst NIMBYist people are Baby Boomers who got in on this urban property pretty cheaply 40 years ago or so. And they want to keep those property valuations way up. So that means no high-density anything, which means crazy high property prices and very high rents. And who bears the burden of this? The young, the people trying to start their careers. So the Baby Boomers also said, \u201cScrew you, children and grandchildren! Our own parents gave us cheap property in cities, but now we don\u2019t want our property values to go down, even a bit. So no to high-density development, no to apartments, no to affordable housing! Now you\u2019re on your own!\u201d\n\nThis is the harsh truth Millennials must face: the old are screwing us, the young, big time. And the old don\u2019t like hearing this harsh, harsh truth because they don\u2019t like to see themselves as the bad guys who achieved much lower taxes after the 1980s by ruthlessly cutting back on things that benefit the young, the things they themselves enjoyed when they were whippersnappers.

Free is good, paid is fine, subscription is a scam.\n\nI have an iPhone, and I'll post the best underrated apps I have that I use. With both Android and iOS, there are usually a bunch of apps competing for the same spot on your phone. The difference between a phone guy and a casual user is one who looked at all the options and found the best (not always the same answer, since we're all different) and the other who just got the first thing they found and made it work, for better or worse.\n\nMost of these are free, and most are on both major mobile platforms. I'll let you know if they're not.\n\nOurGroceries: Shopping list. Been using it for almost 10 years now. It's on iOS, it's on Android, and it's on the web. Totally free to use, but it has a banner ad. $5 to get rid of it. Worth paying on Android. If you have an iPhone, you should know the developer doesn't care about Apple at all. We don't get any of the good features. It's pretty bare-bones. Still worth paying if you want that extra quarter inch, but absolutely not necessary.\n\niShows TV: tracks TV shows through Trakt.tv. This is iOS only. Trakt.tv is a website you can use on your desktop (or mobile) browser. On Android, SeriesGuide is the way to go, and it's free. iShows costs $2 or $3. Basically, you add the shows you watch, and as you watch them, you mark them as seen and you can rate them out of 10 (five stars but you can do half stars). If the show is ongoing, it will show how many days until the next episode, but if you're behind, it'll show how many aired episodes you haven't seen yet. For anyone who watches a lot of shows, this is good stuff.\n\nBing: Laugh it up... it's not Google. On mobile, it's better. I've checked it out on Android, too, and it's just as legit there. Microsoft threw everything but the kitchen sink at their app. Private searching is front and center if you want to be anonymous. It has maps, weather, news, all kinds of stuff. And the best part of all? While the Google app will quite literally tunnel around your ad blocker, if you have one, to get ads onto your phone, Bing. Includes. An Ad. Blocker. Yes, it has Adblock Plus built right in. ABP is the controversial one with \"Acceptable Ads\" which means ad providers can pay to bypass it, but this feature can be disabled to make ABP a decent ad blocker. Look, if you need help with games, ever, you know Wikia is a festering shithole of ads. Bing your game stuff, you'll see the difference it makes. ABP has to be turned on first, though, as it's off by default, though once it sees so many ads, it will tell you about it.\n\nGoogle Keep: A few people mentioned this already, but it's worth repeating. Best notes app ever. Once you do categories and sharing, it gets so much better.\n\nApollo: Best Reddit client on iOS, and it's not even close. When I used Android, I used Sync and BaconReader. Bacon's on iOS, too, but it's a different app made by a different team at the same company. There are a TON of Reddit clients for both platforms, and most of them are made by Redditors who want to make Reddit better, so... most of them are somebody's favorite. I just try different Reddit clients and find things that they don't do that Apollo does. Apollo matches my flow. Maybe you use Reddit differently. In any case, it's worth trying different ones, and it's worth paying for a few different ones. I prefer Apollo, but I want to see others thrive, too, because that encourages everyone to do their best.\n\nGoogle Photos: I saw this mentioned once as \"free backup.\" It's more than that. All photos 16MP or less will be backed up for free. Above 16MP, you get to make a choice. Downsample to 16MP or use your Google Drive storage (15GB free, with paid plans for more). No iPhone has had more than 12MP to date. Some Android phones have gone over 16, though. My wife's last phone was 20 or 24, I forget which. 16MP is fine, though, and if your camera is less... I always hear about people who lost precious photos... this doesn't have to be a problem. And it's a solution that is free to solve. And there's much more to Google Photos.\n\nScanner Mini: Someone mentioned CamScanner, which has issues, and they were brought to the poster's attention, I suppose, given their edit. The truth is, you shouldn't pay for scanning. Google, Microsoft, and Apple all do it for free. Google's is Photo Scanner. Microsoft's is Office Lens. And Apple's is built into Notes. I use Readdle's Scanner Mini. It works with Documents, their file manager. There is a pro version but I don't need it.\n\nDocuments: Almost forgot this because it's on my dock and I'm going by homepage. Documents is an iOS file manager and cloud manager that plays media and reads documents. It also lets me turn my phone into a WiFi drive and share everything with anyone on the same WiFi network. I have yet to meet a good Android file manager that does that. Let me be clear, if we're on the same network, I can take your Android phone, open Chrome, browse to an address (docsfiletransfer dot com), this will give you a barcode, my iPhone scans it, and now your Android phone is browsing my iPhone, and you can download any file I have on it. If you have an iPhone, it's easier, my Documents will detect your Documents and they auto pair and I can send the file right on over. For Android, Solid is the file manager of choice. But it doesn't do the WiFi drive. There are apps out there that do, but since I don't use Android as my personal phone, I haven't really looked into it.\n\nMovies Anywhere: More of a service, but it's also an app. It's Disney's movie streaming service, but it has a poorly kept secret. If you connect another streaming service to it, like iTunes, it will give you free iTunes copies of everything in MA and free MA copies of everything in iTunes. Well, limited to certain studios, and movies only, not TV, music, books, anime, any of that stuff. There are like 7 services it supports, and if you connect more than a couple, they even give you free movies, and they go to all services. I'll tell you two reasons why this is awesome. One, if one service goes under, your movies still exist on ALL the rest. Two, iTunes has good sales and whatever, but you can only really watch its movies on Apple devices. If you switched from iPhone to Android, Apple sort of holds those movies hostage. Connect MA and Google, and now you can watch iTunes movies on YouTube. Yeah. That's huge. YouTube is on everything. So is Vudu, but YouTube is probably something you use more.\n\nWaze: Social maps. Shows things like speed traps, and debris on the road. Contingent upon people actually reporting these things, and you can report them yourself. Pretty nice map app, too, though Google Maps reigns supreme here. (Google owns Waze.)\n\nChrome Remote Desktop/AnyDesk: You know what's cool? Running Windows on your phone. You can't actually run Windows 10 on an iPhone, or an Android phone for that matter, but if you have Chrome Remote Desktop on your computer, you can access it right from your phone, whether you're in the same room or on the other side of the planet. The possibilities are endless. AnyDesk has more options, but isn't quite as smooth. But AnyDesk lets you control an Android phone from the computer or an iPhone, as long as the app is running (but not the other way around, iOS is the only platform that cannot host). So yeah, Android on an iPhone. This isn't for practical use, it's for helping someone. So if you were having problems with your Android phone, you could give me your desk number, and I could take over your phone, over the Internet, from my iPhone, and use it like I was holding it. There is some input lag, and if you didn't like what I was doing, you could kick me off. Good for people with older parents. Chrome Remote Desktop can only host on PC. I prefer CRD for taking control of my PC with my phone, but AnyDesk has uses as well.\n\nGoogle Opinion Rewards: Mentioned before, but they didn't mention it's for iOS, too. And the iOS version pays out, every $2 earned, to PayPal. That's because PayPal can be used for App Store/iTunes purchases, but, unlike Android users, iOS users can cash out their Opinion Rewards money. Also, being an iPhone user means your opinion is worth more. That's not my opinion. That's Google, giving me fewer surveys than my wife when we both had Android (women get more surveys) and now me getting more surveys with an iPhone. If *she* got an iPhone, her surveys would go way up.\n\nOpener: This is iOS only, because it addresses a problem that Android never had. So on Android, if you have two or more of the same app, Android will ask you which app you want to use. Makes sense, right? Apparently, Apple never figured out how to do that. And it's a damn shame. Some apps can choose the app they want to call, but there's no system-wide setting. So something that would open in the app you don't want it to, share it to Opener, and Opener will do what Android does, offer you the choice and let you set it. Android expats using iOS will enjoy this greatly.\n\nedit: Broke Reddit's limit! One more in the replies."}, {"score": 15, "id": "eofjhgn", "text": "UVLens. It shows you the UV index for your area.

He (lets call him Mickey) had been with this girl (Minnie) for almost 4 years when out of nowhere, she told him she is leaving him and moving out. He had no idea the relationship was in jeopardy, but she dipped. \n\nAnyway, a few weeks go by. Mickey is hanging out with a coworker of his with who he had just recently met and ends up back at his place just to hang out. On the fridge, he sees a note in Minnie\u2019s handwriting. The note detailed several issues in Mickey and Minnie\u2019s relationship and so Mickey asks his new friend where he found this note.\n\nTurns out, this new buddy had gone to the same music festival as Mickey and Minnie a few months prior. The friend had found the note on the ground of the parking lot and thought \u201cwow, what a sad and angry note. I\u2019m going to keep this because it\u2019s so raw and interesting.\u201d \n\nThe next day, Minnie came over to pick up some of her things. Mickey produced the note and it led to a long tear-filled conversation about their relationship and what went wrong. They didn\u2019t end up back together, because despite the pseudonyms, this is no Disney story. However, the resulting discussion helped them both achieve closure in a meaningful way. \n\nAll because a random coworker found and kept her discarded note in a festival parking lot.\n\nEdit: a bunch of you are saying Minnie was hooking up with the coworker but I can assure you that was not the case. Mickey and Minnie had never even met the coworker, as Mickey and the coworker both work jobs for a massive company and had never crossed paths until well after Minnie left. Mickey and him had just become friends days after the breakup. \n\nAs for why he kept the note, he\u2019s just that kind of guy. He was moved by the content of the note so he kept it. They weren\u2019t having an affair or anything - and if they were, that\u2019d be well over because Minnie moved to another city the same week she left Mickey.\n\nDon\u2019t be too cynical folks. Sometimes things just don\u2019t work out.  \n\nEdit 2: and for those thinking Mickey is partly at fault for the relationship ending and being oblivious to the reasons for her sudden leaving... of course he is. And he recognizes this. He recognizes his role in the situation and doesn\u2019t hate her or anything. He just wants her to be happy and is heartbroken over both of their failures in making that happen. He\u2019s a good guy, and he\u2019s learning.\n\nEdit 3: for people saying I am in fact Mickey, I am not haha I\u2019m happily married for one year and you could probably comb through my other comments to prove it if you really wanted but that would be boring.

I chose the hospital since I was in that much pain. Turns out there wasn\u2019t anything to do but take pain killers and chill.\n\nWhen it got round to the Saturday my aunt went out to get me some LEGO to cheer me up. Her and my brother stopped at a swimming pool for a while on the way back where she was throwing some of those weight toys that they got from the toy store into the pool for him to dive down and get. Some German teenagers were taking the toys so my aunty tried to shout at them in broken German so they left to a deserted part of the pool.

He\u2019d never heard them before, really dug it and asked me about them. It was the day before Easter break and he was like \u201ccool, I\u2019ll check them out\u201d. Cut to two weeks later, he\u2019s telling me how he has bought all their records, got his long-distance girlfriend into them when he visited her and has basically listened to nothing but them since we spoke about it. I feel good for helping a buddy discover his new favourite band, but think nothing more of it.\n\nThat summer me and this dude have a falling out (long story, but the tl;dr is that he screwed me out of nearly \u00a31000) and a bit later, I stop seeing him around. After a while a mutual friend tells me he\u2019s dropped out and moved away.\n\nThe next summer, A friend of mine asks me if I want a Ticket to see Reel Big Fish that evening. His sister was supposed to go but is really sick and can\u2019t. I say sure and tag along.

Me and said girl have been together basically since that night. We\u2019re moving in together and it\u2019s going really great. The night we move in together, we\u2019re sitting amongst all our boxes of shit on the only seats that are unpacked and I say something like; \u201cImagine if I hadn\u2019t taken [friend\u2019s] offer to go to that RBF show that night. We\u2019d never have met\u201d She\u2019s then like \u201cNot only that, imagine if you hadn\u2019t bumped into me and we hadn\u2019t got to talking. Our original plan that night was to leave after Goldfinger played as they were the only band we were bothered about seeing\u201d\n\nI commented something about how I really liked them or something, I forget what. And then I ask how she got into them and, I\u2019m paraphrasing but the long and short of it was: \u201cOh my sister got me into them. Her douchebag ex-boyfriend got her into them. They were long distance while she studied in the US. They used to go to shows together when he would visit. He\u2019s actually from round here I think\u201d\n\nYup.

We're still friends though.\n\nSo I think this story takes place in the summer of 2003.  Might have been 2004, not sure, but I think it was 2003.  She was up in Cape Cod because her grandmother had a house out in Eastham.  Her whole family is up there visiting, her parents, some cousins, a bunch of people.  One day she borrows her mom's minivan to drive into Boston to meet up with a friend.  She's driving back late at night, and the road is pretty deserted.  All of a sudden she sees some kind of animal up on the road ahead.  She's not sure but she thinks it might be a wolf.  She slams on the brakes.  I'm talking, shit-goes-flying kind of slam on the brakes.  It's scary and chaotic and the wolf, or whatever it is, eventually runs off.  She drives the rest of the way to her grandmother's house, and tries to discreetly tell her dad what happened.  But the oldsters in the room have cottoned on to the fact that a secret is being shared and they all want to know what happened.  Eventually the story comes out.  My wife's grandmother, who, God love her, would go on to live to the age of 97, responded by saying, \"that's why women shouldn't drive at night.\"  I found this response absolutely *hilarious* and for years I enjoyed making reference to it at inappropriate times and circumstances.\n\nAnyway, everyone goes to bed and all seems well.  Until the next day when my ex is driving the same van back out towards Boston.  Now, Cape Cod is pretty much a 1-way-on, 1-way-off kind of an island.  And I forgot to mention but it's the end of a holiday weekend, I think it was the 4th of July.  So traffic is really crazy.  Eventually she is at a standstill on the main road for so long, she puts the van in park to wait.\n\nAnd then when traffic moves again she can't get it back out of park.  Like, it just won't shift out of park, no matter what she does.  She turns the car off and back on.  Nope.  Nothing.  So now she has a car in murderously awful traffic, on a road that (if memory serves) only has 2 lanes to begin with, and she can't move. She can't get out of the way.  She's stuck and making already bad traffic much worse.  She's by the side of the road and people are driving by screaming obscenities at her.  And she's thinking, \"believe me, I would *love* to fuck off right about now but this car is broken and I don't know what to do!\"\n\nSo after what seems like forever, eventually these 2 guys stop to help.  And they're trying to figure out what's going on.  It's a really weird problem and it's taking them awhile.  And the whole time, my ex is thinking, this one guy looks kind of familiar.  Like, she keeps eyeing him, you know.  Trying to figure out if she knows him.  And if she does, where does she know him from.\n\nNow, at this point, I'll mention the answer to the car riddle, which the 2 guys sadly never figured out.  It turns out, (and I know how crazy this sounds), that the following had happened:  when she stopped short for the wolf, a coin somehow got lodged in the cigarette lighter.  It eventually caused a short circuit.  The circuit that blew was also connected to the gear shifter.  So when the short happened, she was no longer able to shift.  Insane.\n\nBack to the 2 guys.  The one guy notices my ex noticing the other guy and trying to figure out why he seems familiar.  And so finally he says, \"Do you watch Alias?\"\n\nAnd that was when my ex realized that one of the guys who stopped to help her was Bradley Cooper.\n\nUnfortunately, selfies weren't really the standard at the time that they are today, so she didn't think to include herself in the picture she took of the 2 guys.  But she does have the picture of Bradley Cooper and his friend, the nice guys who stopped and tried to help her with her car trouble.  And she didn't recognize him at all at the time, but much later she realized, from looking at the picture, that the other guy was Bryan Callen.\n\nSo, to review, some kind of animal was hanging out in a road on Cape Cod one night, and as a result my ex-wife met Bradley Cooper and Bryan Callen."}, {"score": 579, "id": "emzloun", "text": "If my former roommate wasn't an alcoholic going thru withdrawal and had to be hospitalized, we'd have had enough money for rent.

There was a briefing of this in class and I didn't listen to a word the teacher said. So I wrote down my home address which was further away from where the school was. So, while most of my school agreed to go to \"Secondary School A\" which is near to the primary school, I was assigned to go to \"Secondary School B\" which is on the opposite side of town (much further from School A and my home).\n\nMy dad tried to get me reassigned back to School A (where everyone I knew was going to), but the school was somehow already full and I couldn't get in. So the only alternative (other than going to School B on the other side of town), I got into School C which is nearer to home.\n\nInteresting note: I was a timid, reclusive child in primary school, never really had close friends and was often picked on and bullied. So in the new school with new faces, I wanted to make a change for myself and decided to be a prefect for the discipline and boost in self-confidence. I became one of the only two prefects to stay one for all 5 years of secondary school (the other was the head prefect). Also, School C was the only school in the district to offer \"Engineering Drawing\" as an elective, so I took the class based on the fact I was good in English and Maths and that paved way to my current career as a Civil Engineer. My engineering classmates was also much better to interact with than my primary classmates and the childhood bullies.

Based on other circumstantial evidence from the same context, this was from a relatively poor family, who trained their children in the same trade as them to create beautiful pottery to sell to the elites. In the Stuart era, that style of pottery was around a lot, but it had started not too far from the city we found it in, so we figured they must have been copying the popular style.

It\u2019s like a one stop shop for dancers.

One of them held up some lingerie against her body and looked at him as if to ask him what he thought.

Told my store manager about that one before I talked to the person I thought he may have meant and turns out this weirdo was calling all the stores saying the same thing.\n\n* Had a customer who wanted a couple of the women employees to try on shoes for him so he could pick something out for his wife.

I've worked in Hot Topic for 3 years! I'm 8 time employee of the month and really well liked by most customers at my location, so much so that I'll be eating in the food court and people will come up to me and ask if I'm the hot topic girl.\n\nAnyways, one day I was working a shift with one of the assistant store managers. It was an incredibly slow day and we were just tidying up the store while chatting about our pets. Since there wasn't much to do, my boss thought it was a perfect time for a break, so I had the floor to myself. Our location is small and usually this is fun for me because I get to help ALL customers that come in. \n\nHowever right as he leaves, we have the nastiest, rudest two women come in. They charge right up to me and begin screaming at me in a Chinese language, I'm unsure if it was mandarin or Cantonese. Note, I'm half Japanese half white but people often think I'm just white. \nSo cut back to the story, these two women are SCREAMING at me. I calmly tell them I have no idea what they're trying to tell me as I only speak English and the tiniest bit of French. The one woman just starts shouting return as close to my face as possible. So I ask for her receipt. No receipt. If they don't have a receipt we have to ask if they have a points account so we can see previous purchases and make sure they did buy this shirt within the last 30 days. So I ask if they have a phone number or email with us. One is still screaming in her language at me and the other woman says I'm trying to steal her information. I explain that I just want to see when the shirt was purchased. The absolutely no English speaking woman pulled a different receipt from her purse and shoved it into my hands. The shirt in question wasn't even on the receipt and the receipt was from October, this happened in February. I explain this to them and say they have 30 days, not multiple months and the woman decides to say I don't know how the store works and she's done it before. \n\nI decide to at least take a look at the shirt she was trying to return. It was a pickle Rick shirt that had no tag, not one but multiple stains on it and was oddly warm. I explained it needs to be unwashed, unworn and have the tags still on it to be able to be returned and the woman says \"yeah, no washed,\" as if I couldn't tell from all the stains. I tell them I won't be doing the return as if I had returned it I'd get some serious questioning from the Store Manager and the ASM'S.\n\nThey leave and come back in about 10 minutes. Right after the ASM comes back from his break. They begin to scream at him in their language too. He is white, doesn't look remotely Asian at all so at this point we were both kind of like, \"what the heck?\" I explain to him the situation and he agrees that we can't return the shirt. The woman then smacks me with the receipt she had and begins screaming in my face in her language. The other woman says we are too rude, and should be fired. I decide enough's enough and we'll call security. I'm waiting for them to pick up and my boss says, let's just do the return. Then he retracts that idea once he sees the shirt. It was honestly gross.\n\nSo he explains that the shirt needs to be unworn, unwashed and have the tags still on, the woman again says it wasn't washed. The other woman who spoke no English shoves my boss and screams more. \n\nMy boss is the nicest person. Like people are rude to him all the time and he still gives them service with a smile but will tell us his tale of woe afterwards. So he just kindly refuses to do their transaction. At this point I call security again but nobody was answering the phone. So we ask them to leave the store. They do, surprisingly. \n\nThen, maybe 5 minutes later, they come back with a woman from Michael hill, a fancy jewelry store who basically was trying to act as their translator with some obviously made up story that they were vacationing in Canada and there was no way she could be bought the shirt in October because they had only been there a week. I asked how she had a receipt from our location from October and she ignored my question and just argued with the store manager over the return in question. After guilt tripping him and offering him a discount on rings if he ever needed one, she convinced him to do the return. \n\nAt this point I walked away from the cash because we had other customers. As I was talking to one of our regulars, they were leaving. The one woman who didn't speak a word of English pushed me on her way out. Had I not been at work, I seriously would've considered punching her. But this customer, who happens to think I'm one of the kindest and most helpful associates we have, gets FIRED up from this and begins telling them how rude it was and how they can't go around shoving people. The make the rude blah blah blah hand motion to him and smirk at me. Nice customer feels badly for me and says he doesn't know how I deal with stuff like that. Nice customer also tells customer service about what happened and that I'm great so if there's any complaints he wants to cancel them out.\n\nLuckily there was no complaint but I'd be happy if I never saw those woman again."}, {"score": 72, "id": "emqqbhb", "text": "I never worked there but in my youth hanging at the mall was like totally the thing to do and hot topic was in my price range for shopping.

It seemed like every person who touched a t-shirt would ball it up and throw it somewhere out of place. I probably folded thousands of t-shirts. But whatever, just part of the job.\n\nI started there when they first began their rewards program. My manager was always on my ass trying to get me to sell this membership. Nobody wanted a damn membership, or maybe I was a bad salesman, but either way, I rarely signed anyone up. This was reflected on the weekly report sent to the district manager, and I even got written up over it.\n\nI started working there because I loved music, and their album rack was always down my alley. They're a musically oriented company, so they had this sound system integrated with a central server that played a selection of maybe 10 songs, to be updated every month.\n\nWell it didn't update for close to 3 months. Every day I would hear the same songs 5 or 6 times over, for months, and it *drove me insane*. To this day I still get burnt out on music faster than anyone I know. \n\nDuring my breaks I would hang out in the run down, barely open mall and grab a bite at the Auntie Ann's. Their pizza pretzel was my shit, and the cute cashier would hook me up with free marinara. We would flirt and chat all the time.\n\nI eventually got her number, I texted her (with my flip Motorola) and we planned to hang out. \n\nI had my older friend buy me a Four Loco, when they still had caffeine, and I drove to her place at 10pm to pick her up. We shared the drink in the car on the way back to my house. We barely talked, unlike at the mall. Very awkward.\n\nI took her to my sparsely furnished, unfinished basement and immediately we went at it. When we were done we kind of awkwardly sat there and I took her home just after midnight. \n\nFrom then on she would come into the Hot Topic to look for me and I would hide in the back while my manager covered for me.

I had pretty much taken care of all the organizing and cleaning up that needed done on the floor, everything that had to go out the next day was out. So I was just strolling around the floor looking for stuff to fold and this lady comes in. She looked young but I honestly thought she was older than me (I was 19 at the time).\n\nShe strikes up a conversation with me almost immediately and I rattle off my retail manager jargon, asking if I can help her find anything and letting her know the sales. After she looks around for a minute, she asks if we sell any nipple rings. We did have a few, so I told her yes and opened up the cabinet that held that particular style of body jewelry. \n\nThe rule was that we had to stand with the customer and be near them when those cases were open so they didn\u2019t steal. As she looked, she asked me to get down with her and look give my opinions on what she was looking at. I felt a little awkward, and honestly I thought nipple rings were a little much, but I tried my best to be friendly and told her \u201cYeah, that one\u2019s cool.\u201d and let her know we had more on our clearance shelves.\n\nEventually, while she was looking, she decided to dive into the story of how she got it, and how she thought the size of her current piercing was different than it should be. I nodded along and said whatever \u201cOh, dang.\u201d or \u201cYeeeah.\u201d it whatever to make sure she didn\u2019t think I was ignoring her.\n\nThen she asked me if I wanted to see it.\n\n\u201cOh, no thank you.

Now, she asks me to join her in sitting on the floor and seeing what hair color she should get. I obliged her until more customers finally came in (thank God), but BEFORE that happened, she once again asked me if I wanted to see her nipple piercing. Again, I declined. She acted like I was missing out on something. \n\nOh yeah, and I also had a pair of 40-yr. old moms come in and flirt with me at the register when they checked out. One asked if they could take me and get me a drink for being so helpful and I told her no, I\u2019m too young.

Like some tied it around their waist, some tied them around their heads, some tied it around their arm, some of them used them as hair ties, the list goes on. Needless to say, it made the teachers furious and embarrassed, however, the founder found the entire situation \"very funny, appreciated our respect for the school\" and praised us for our \"United front.\"\n\nThe \"Red and gold rebellion\" was successful in more ways than one. (The ties were Red, gold and black.) Not only did we get our restrictions lifted, but we also became closer to the founder and was given access speak to him if more trouble arose, the teachers grew to appreciate the many more aspects of life and the entire student body became more like a family. \n\nAnyway, after that, they refined their student handbook and specified where to wear your ties and more. They really disallowed rebellion through uniform loopholes after that, which I found hilarious. \n\nTL;DR: Student body had enough with the heavy rules and restrictions, used a loophole through uniforms rules to revolt and got any uniform loophole exploitation banned."}, {"score": 107, "id": "epdtnba", "text": "The numbers 212, 313, & 525.

What is supposed to happen is I was to walk to the crew chief and hand it to him so he could have the pilot turn off the #2 engine and then he we walk over, check that the engine was off by holding his hand close to the inlet (often while holding onto something in case the suction tried to grab him.) then when he felt it safe he'd proceed forward and pin the nose wheel.\n\nWhat I did was start walking straight to the nose wheel from under the jet. I got inches from being sucked into a meat grinder when I saw the crewchief's face contort into an expression that can only be described as \"I'm about to watch someone die.\" I snapped out of it and backed the fuck up.\n\nSleep deprivation and jet engines are a bad and all too common combo."}, {"score": 43, "id": "eoxqdq9", "text": "Looking for a pencil to do homework with and thoroughly checking the kitchen pantry."}, {"score": 42, "id": "eoxw0dc", "text": "One time I was eating wheat thins while wrapping christmas presents.

When my city (Joplin Missouri) was hit by a multi vortex EF5 tornado on May 22nd 2011 we had a torrential downpour for 2 or 3 days after it. Anyway, back to the school. We recovered the living & the bodies and flew them out to a larger hospital for treatment. I gave them medical attention on scene and started what's known as \"Psychological First Aid\" because I knew these kids were fucked from what they saw & experienced. Every few months I reached out to family members of the children to check and see how they were doing (weird maybe but the last time I saw these kids they weren't in great shape. The kids were able to recover for the most part and things were going good, I thought. I learned that 3 of the kids started massive drug addictions when they got into junior high and at least 2 of them had attempted suicide. It tore me apart because I'm now a father myself and I saw what these kids experienced, all the while hoping they wouldn't be affected long term. I fear the future because these kids who are now in middle school & high school started doing some pretty horrible things to address the pain & nightmares they live daily. I honestly wish I could do more because these kids never had a chance and it was no one's fault, no one could have predicted what happened and what would happen.\n\nWe learned a lot about tornadoes with this particular tornado, the tornado that hit my town, and the 2nd tornado that hit the town the kids were in. We'll never again send kids to the hallway or basements because pop machines, water fountains etc get sucked down the hallways, kids get sucked out of hallways, and basements fill with water during these events.\n\nI see these kids in my sleep, I see the people they've grown up to be but somehow I still see the soaked, filthy children with tears running down their faces, blood soaking their clothes, and I can feel how tight they dug their nails into me as they hugged & held on for dear life, not wanting us to let them go because they were terrified that it would happen again.\n\n\nIt's not family induced trauma but it's the one thing in my career that sticks out more than anything."}, {"score": 182, "id": "ene9qbk", "text": "I had a patient whose mom pulled her out of school due to anxiety and bullying....and then just didn't seek help.

I quit my job of 10 years, got on a plane and arrived in the UK in September 2018.

I was kind of skeptical when she sent me these because he would never say that stuff, but obviously I couldn\u2019t just come out and tell her I didn\u2019t believe her cause if it was true then I\u2019d be a terrible person. What I thought was happening was I thought she was changing her contact info and texting herself making it seem like it was her dad who was sending that stuff. Anyways, this happens a few more times in the next few weeks and I\u2019m just there for her trying to be a good boyfriend because there\u2019s always a chance it could be true. Well one weekend she went to a concert with her friend and after the concert she was drunk and we were FaceTiming and she told me that I was still in love with my ex. Immediately I\u2019m like what are you talking about why do you say that?? And she responds by telling me that I texted my ex telling her I still love her and she has the screenshot. I told her to send it to me and there it was a screenshot of me telling my ex I love her. The problem was that I never sent that and it was obvious she texted herself saying that because she was drunk and wasn\u2019t able to type that out correctly. She made it realistic though, because she even went out of her way to use the exact contact picture I had for my ex which was a very unique dumb picture. The moment this happened I knew the screenshots of her dad weren\u2019t real and I proceeded to say goodnight and break up with her the day she got back.

He was a decent kid, well liked, he just had troubles in school and was a bit hyperactive. Well, an untrue rumour had started earlier in the day that he had cheated on his girlfriend. By our block in the afternoon in Grade 10 the rumour had been cleared up. Apparently it was started in spite by a previous friend of the guy. Anyways, apparently the teacher hadn\u2019t received the news just the content of the rumour. \n\nClass starts and the teacher (who is a known bully) starts off by saying today you are going to hear a special piece of literature in order to comprehend the importance of spelling and grammar. Immediately the hairs stand on up on the back of my neck. I was a shy kid and raised to do our best at respecting our elders but my mom was one to root for the underdog. I had this feeling, I just knew what she was planning to do, she was going for the jugular. And it didn\u2019t feel right. \n\nI stood up (kind of stunned with myself) and yelled \u201cyou better stop this bullshit\u201d. Picture the quietest easily bullied kid in your class saying it. The rest of the class didn\u2019t comprehended my intent and I froze or maybe they just wanted to witness the drama.

In high sight I should have just ran to the office but I was scared. \n\nThe teacher then proceeds to read out a very personal letter that she says is written by a guy to his girlfriend. It includes details about how the author was sexual abused by his step-father at 14 and the confusing feelings he had about the situation and thoughts of suicide. (This is the 1990s and sexual abuse wasn\u2019t well understood and the victim would sometimes be shamed for apparently wanting it. Yes, I lived in the sticks.) She also intentionally stumbled at every grammatical and spelling error. She then turns to the guy and says \u201csee if you wanted to confess your feelings to your girlfriend, you should have edited first.\u201d\n\nThe class bursts out laughing. The guy is just emotionally stunned. I didn\u2019t know how it impacted him and was too shy to even ask. And it just wasn\u2019t ever discussed. That kind of bullying was so normalized. And I stupidly worried I\u2019d be in trouble too for failing him and worried nobody would believe me. And afraid I\u2019d be bullied more. Luckily the rumour mill didn\u2019t fly. He had good friends I guess. But, some kids would always tease him and say \u201cDaddy wants a BJ\u201d. \n\nYears later drunk at our high school reunion he came up and asked if I could chat. He then proceeds to thank me for my kindness and apologize for never standing up for me. I said but \u201cI failed you.\u201d He said \u201cyou didn\u2019t, you tried\u201d. He said that it was discovered the girlfriend had given the letter to her mom out of fear for his safety. And the teacher had taken it from her best friend (this lady was a bully to everyone).

This was in the snowy North of the U.S.\nI did extensive research online, and I felt that there was enough reasonable doubt and concern to at least take what I felt were the minimal necessary precautions.\n\n- generator, I bought a 4000 w generac, with cast iron cylinder sleeve and overhead cam. It was expensive, but I didn't want a cheap one, with a lawnmower engine. I still own it, and it powers the furnace, fridge, microwave and lights when we lose power from storms.\n\n- Gasoline, it was possible gas supplies could have been interrupted, so I purchased some plastic, 55 gallon barrels. I filled three with gasoline. I also had the 50 gallon tank in my boat filled, and all of my Jerry jugs and portable boat gas tanks. All together, I had about 255 gallons of fuel. I estimated we could have had normal electricity for two months with this. In the end, it worked out ok, because gas prices went pretty high early in 2000, so I liked using up my cheap gas over a few months.\n\n- Water, I had two, 55 gallon plastic barrels filled with water, preserved with the required drops of bleach.\n\n- food, we had a modest supply of food. We had a couple shelving units with dried and canned foods. Nothing crazy. It was stuff we normally ate, so we used it all up eventually.\n\n- misc., I had rechargable batteries, candles, etc., All of the usual storm prep items too.\n\nOverall, I feel I had adequate preparation, without going overboard. I didn't buy a shotgun, for example. I felt the prep was worth it, even if the risk was small, because I couldn't imagine how bad it would be to have to live in a shelter with an infant and a toddler.

I work for a company that sells steel parts and we had a client that required every purchase of a particular steel grade to be hardness tested in a very tedious and antiquated way. It was a  repetitive job and the colleague I'm referring to was hired for it because of her autism. The company got subsidized to employ her and she liked the routine of the job. We work with a small team in the warehouse, which is in another city than the sales office (and manager/ceo) is located. It's a relatively small company and we don't have any scheduled HR talks or whatever. So if you don't make an appointment with the  manager our wage or work is just never discussed. That's why I took the initiative to negotiate (without her knowing) to get her a pay raise. I had a very good relationship with her, we had become good friends. Due to the pleasant atmosphere in our team she had also blossomed into a much more all-round worker than what she was initially hired for. She's just a smart and kind hearted woman with a lot of humor, but very unconfrontational and socially anxious due to her autism. Bad experiences with people exploiting her in her previous jobs had made this worse throughout the years. In our team she was fully accepted. She worked hard and efficiently without ever complaining. So it was right for her to get a raise and she would have never gotten it spontaneously. I only did what I thought was right. When I told her she got a raise she was super happy, in tears. We are still friends and see each other, even though she is retired now. Yesterday I had lunch at her house, which we do every couple of months.

My mind was a million miles away. I wasn\u2019t talkative at all, and I left after about an hour. I feel like I lost three good friends that evening because of my behaviour at dinner and my subsequent withdrawal from the whole community. I\u2019m sure they look back on that evening and think what a nightmare host I was.\n\n*Edited to add several missing Ts"}, {"score": 1824, "id": "eo56klc", "text": "I was on MeetMe, met this guy who was super cool. We ended up texting every single day and i took the train out to Los Angeles to meet him. When i got there, he was being kinda shitty and he told me that he hadn't gotten much sleep becuz he was partying until 5am. We walked to his house and when I walked into his room, i was kind of shocked. It was a 8x6.5 room. All he had was a mat on the floor and a small little jewelry box full of mementos on top of his suitcase of clothes. We took a nap together. Later, we went to get ramen and he asked me to pay. I didn't mind. We went back to his place and we listened to music while we waited to go to a party. \n\nFast forward to that night..we met up with some of his friends and they were so mean to him. They kept roasting him and picking on him and he was visibly getting upset. I stopped him for a bit so his friends could walk ahead of us. I reminded him that it was all fun nd games and to ignore them. Ended up at the party and lots of people knew him. I sat out in the patio with a few cool people that i had just met while i waited for my friend to come back from saying hello to everyone inside...he never did. I was outside in the patio with these strangers for about 3 hours. People kept coming up to me and asking if i was alright. Idk if i looked sad or if i just looked like a plain loner. I went to find him and it was so packed. Didn't see him so i walked back. I seen his roommate and asked him to please tell my friend that I was gonna go get a motel. He went to tell him, came back and said my friend was being a dick & he would walk me back to the house instead so i didn't have to spend money on a hotel. We got to the house and I thanked him for walking all the way back home. I really appreciated it as my friend was probz inside doing coke or fucking girls. I went to bed in my friends room and he woke me up in the middle of the night kissing me, trying to get his freak on. I simply said no. I'm not interested in having sex. His exact words were, \"Are you serious? What was the point of you coming here?? You're such a waste of time!\" My feelings were really hurt. I went back to sleep, woke up and left.

We met because she made one of those\u201dwhich twilight characters are you?\u201d quizzes, and I was asking for help on making mine. We got to talking and realized that we were roughly the same age, lived in the same state only a couple hours apart, and had quite a few things in common. \n\nFast forward a few months, I start thinking of her as one of my genuine best friends, and we start to broach the subject of meeting irl. My parents- understandably- have their doubts, and only agree to let me meet her if I agree to bring my older brother along. (I was 13, he was 18).  I agree, and the girl and I arrange to meet at a museum that is equidistant from both of us. \n\nSo the day comes, and it\u2019s time for me to finally meet this girl I\u2019ve been talking to for a solid 6-7 months. My brother agrees that he\u2019s not going to breathe down my neck, but that I\u2019ll always be within eyeshot. I see her at the entrance when I walk up, and everything seems to be going well! After all, she\u2019s not an 80 year old man, and she looks exactly like her pictures, which is really all that I could possibly expect from the situation. \n\nLater on in the day, my brother meets up with us so that he could drive us somewhere to get lunch, and everything immediately went downhill from there. This was the first time my brother had really seen her up close, and not from a few meters away, and he gets a really confused look on his face. He doesn\u2019t react further, but stays pretty much quiet the rest of the drive. I think nothing of it, and just assume that he\u2019s letting us talk and doesn\u2019t want to interrupt. \n\nWhen we get to the restaurant, she doesn\u2019t want to sit on my side of the booth with me, instead choosing to sit next to my brother. She claims that this is because she wants to be able to look at me while she\u2019s talking, but my brother is looking more and more uncomfortable with the situation. I decide to sit next to him instead, and don\u2019t really give her an option. Suddenly, the conversation starts to drift from me and her, to just about my brother. What he does for school, where he works, his friends, etc. I start getting really jealous, and eventually blow up saying \u201care you here to talk to me, or to just my brother???\u201d She starts backpedaling, and apologizes for ignoring me. \n\nAt that moment, my brother finally realizes that he recognizes her as a girl that had been stalking him on MySpace for the past few months, but without all of the terrible filters/makeup/angles that he was use to seeing her with. He immediately gets super freaked out, and starts saying that we need to leave, and that she needs to find her own way home. We end up leaving as soon as her parents come to pick her up, and I never hear from her again. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how my Junior High online best friend was ALSO my brothers weird MySpace stalker.

I started to see why she was such a lonely person. She was mean, if not cruel, to anyone who ever disagreed with her or even had a different opinion. She was so mentally unstable that she couldn't even buy something without having to call her elderly mother and ask for permission. I found out that she was scamming the disability services to get money from the government because she didn't want her mother tracking her spending. She was so horrible to her caregiver. I'll admit that the guy was a complete moron, but he was still a sweet guy that was just trying to help. She was so abusive towards him that I had to step in on multiple occasions, which she fucking hated because it meant i wasn't on her side.

Screaming and crying because I missed a spot while mopping or because I spilled a little bit if water in the kitchen or ate my food too fast. She was fucking INSANE! As soon as I realized how messed up and unstable she was (after being screamed at and chased back to my room) I told her that I was going to be moving out as soon as possible. So, for the next week, she decided to make my life a living hell. She would scream about me to other people on the phone, telling lies about me, saying I did things i never did. And because she was a YouTuber with a big following, she doxed me on social media, telling people I punched holes in her walls and keyed her car. She even called the cops and tried to get me arrested for things I didn't do. Her followers began to harass me, sending me rape/death threats. Then she started posting and sharing all of my personal secrets that I had shared with her in confidence. \n\nI ended up having to call my family to come get me because she was wanting to keep my dog so that I would have to keep in contact with her and I was no longer feeling save.\n\nSo, after six months of living in hell and three years of internet harassment and stalking that followed, I'll never meet someone i met online ever again.

Just my type. We match, talk for a week or so until we decide to get drinks. I get to the bar (took an uber there) and look around... dont see him.

I thought youd never make it!\" Now, I'm not unusually one to judge by appearances, we all have rough days and lord knows I dont wear makeup or do my hair on the busiest of them, but his hair was significantly longer (think short, well manicured hair versus mid back length uncombed waves), he was covered in a patchy beard, and dressed really badly. I honestly didnt recognize him, and he waved it off with \"sorry. Those pictures are kind of old\". \n\nRed flag stupidly ignored, we grab a small table with huge chair and start drinking and talking. One drink, just to be polite, but I'm turned off at this point wholly. \n\nThen, the kicker. \n\nHe leans in toward me, puts his hand on my thigh, and says, \"you know, after you didnt message me back on fetlife, I'm surprised we matched on tinder.

I'm sorry????\"\n\nHe chuckles, literally chuckles like a villain in a movie, pats my thigh, and says \"I'm going to the bathroom. You should look at your profile and figure it out. I found you because your body is quite distinct.\"\n\nIt's worth noting we live in a MAJOR international tourist city. There are thousands upon thousands of new people here every day.

Almost. LONG Story time:\n\nI am an artist, and my main job before the one I have now was selling my work at comic, anime, and video game cons across the US and Canada, and sometimes in more countries. It was surprisingly a lucrative job if you did it right and I enjoyed it, and required a lot more work than people realized. But I digress, the point is I was familiar with the convention scene and this leads me to my next point:\n\nI used to take commissions at conventions but I stopped doing them years ago because I got too busy and my art had improved enough that $100 felt too low for my skill level, and I\u2019m all about artists pricing their work fairly and not working for pennies. A couple of years ago, just as I had started phasing out commission work, a man had approached me at a con. You get a lot of socially awkward people at cons, to be expected, but 99.5% of them are really sweet and just like to talk about stuff the dig. If you have a good amount of patience, it\u2019s enjoyable.\n\nBut this guy... he immediately asked me if I did commissions. I said no, unfortunately not anymore.He asked me how much my prices were, and usually when people ask I just... quote some arbitrary high number just to get them to throw out the idea without outright telling them no. And if they want to pay it, well. Then we can talk. I said $350. He said, cool, done. In cash? I was stammering at him, not expecting him to go for it. Eventually I just asked him what he wanted. To make a long story shorter, he wanted furry art. Soft core porn to be exact. I had never in my life done furry art, but I knew how lucrative it seemed to be. I said oh, each character would be extra. NSFW would be extra too. This would be a big commission. He\u2019s like oh no worries. How much extra?\n\nThis went back and forth for a while and to save time, he paid me $700, in cash, on the spot, for some furry porn. I wasn\u2019t even mad, $700 is nice, so I said sure I\u2019ll draw the furry porn. What do I care? I\u2019ll fake sign it, it\u2019s one and done.\n\nAfter I did it in one night in my hotel room, I found he had taken my business card and had given my email to his friends who may be interested in commissioning art. The requests for weirder and weirder, but the pay stayed surprisingly good. Eventually, I ended up making a FurAffinity account under a fake name and tweaked my style and techniques enough that no one could ever trace the art back to me. I decided to just fully embrace the furry art bank life. It was open season \u2014 I guarantee you I was a no-name in that community and still made good money, so I\u2019m horrified to think what the really popular artists get. I didn\u2019t feel ashamed for drawing weird furry fetish porn, nor did I feel bad for kinda being a fraud. I provided a service, and that was it.\n\nThings went downhill when I mistakenly befriended someone in the community. She was another furry artist, and we just sort of hit it off in the online community. She seemed like an edgy self-hating furry so our jabbing humor at the expense of furries made us bond. She was cool, all was well. Eventually I admitted to her that I didn\u2019t actually give a shit about furries, and she took it in stride. Said she understood why I used the community to make money because she wished she wasn\u2019t a fucking furry either, but you can\u2019t help what you like.\n\nShe told me that if I really wanted to make bank, I should go to a furry convention. I was immediately like fuck no. Never in my life, but she told me about an anime con that I regularly attended that next year would be sharing the same venue and weekend as a furry convention. Just table hop, she said. She told me to split her table with her, try it out, see how I fared. I already had a table at the anime con, so I was like sure, why the hell not? What could it hurt?\n\nWe decided to even share a hotel room. This isn\u2019t uncommon. In artist alleys many artists room share together since we have similar schedules and don\u2019t tend to party hard because we are working. She seemed like a good person and it\u2019s not uncommon to just meet someone irl when you\u2019re rooming with them.\n\nI arrived Thursday before the con, but the furry con had already started. I got a text from my friend to come sit at her table in the furry con \u201cdealers den\u201d for a few hours since my con didn\u2019t start until Friday, just to see if it clicked. She had already checked in to the hotel room and had the keys anyways, so I picked up my badge and went. I was... surprised to find her at the table. In full fursuit.\n\nThey was the weird part. She was a self hating furry, or so she claimed, so to go full commitment and be in a suit was... ok. Hmm. I was already out of my comfort zone in the sea of furries, and my friend was supposed to be like my anchor, my guide through this Other world to protect me from this shit. I was immediately on edge. It got worse when I sat down and introduced myself and she did that... thing. That thing that furries do where they are in fur suits and don\u2019t talk. She nodded when I made sure she was who I thought she was, but she just did the overly exaggerated cute poses and even had a fucking squeaky toy in her fursuit to make noise. But she didn\u2019t say a word. She hugged me, and somehow??? Managed to interact with customers who all knew her and adored her (I guess she was well know in the community) and if she wanted to communicate, would write. Or text in this big ass oaw things. She said she hates wearing suits but because she doesn\u2019t have to talk in them, she doesn\u2019t have to interact much with customers.\n\nOkay. That I could kind maybe believe. Sort of.\n\nAt around 7 Pm we packed up to leave to go to the hotel room. She stayed in suit the whole way up. In the room I flopped down on my bed exhausted. I asked her if she was going to come out of that thing, understandably a little freaked out... from this whole thing. Then she did the thing that made me want to run out of the room, which I didn\u2019t against my better judgment. I had flopped on the bed with the upper half of my body, my feet still on the floor, my shirt had ridden up my torso. She stepped in between my legs and fucking TICKLED me on my exposed belly. I flipped the fuck out, as one does when sneak attacked by tickles and wriggled out of her reach.\n\nShe made that \u201claughing\u201d pose that furries do where they hold their paws to their mouths bashfully but still silent as fuck. I was so creeped out. My go to way of handling stress like that is laughing it off nervously. She got the hint and motioned she was going to get a shower.\n\nAs soon as she was in the shower I decided I didn\u2019t want to be there when she got out, for now. But instead of lugging all my stuff I decided I would come back for it, preferably with friends. But I needed a key, so I went to her wallet she had taken out of one of her suit pockets, and tried to find the keys I had seen her slip in to her wallet. And of course as soon as I opened it I just had to see her ID. I just had to, I was too curious not too. And when I opened it I looked at the ID slot and I flipped. My. Shit.\n\nWhoever was in that ID was not in any way who I was expecting to see on that picture. I didn\u2019t know the super personal details of my friend besides her name and age and general descriptive factors. Mid 20s, white girl, etc. That was not who was on this ID. It was a man, with long greasy hair, glasses, and stubble, in his mid 40 or early 50s I\u2019d wager. I was so fucking shocked that I literally threw the wallet across the room after grabbing a key and ran the FUCK out of that hotel room. I took fifteen flights of stairs down to the lobby and called up a friend who was coming to the con freaking out.\n\nI never saw the real person under the suit. My friend, a tall burly scary looking dude, went up for my stuff later that night with the key I\u2019d grabbed. When he came back with all my things, he said there was no one in the room. I stayed with him in his room that weekend, and kept only to the convention my \u201cfriend\u201d didn\u2019t have a badge to get in to unless I was with a group outside of it. The next night I deleted my furaffinity account, blocked my \u201cfriend\u201d on my chat app, and deleted every connection I had to the furry world. The money be damned.

At the time I thought he cared like a brother or a dad figure. I didn't know he was grooming me. It was just nice to be able to talk to someone who seemed like they cared about me. We decided to meet up for coffee for one day. We agreed to meet up at night a  couple days days later. The whole time leading up to it he was saying he was nervous and scared. I couldn't figure out why he would be scared or nervous. He picks me up a block away from house. First red flag I actually noticed. I get into the car and realize he is one of my brothers high school teachers. I had met this guy before at a open house and he was really nice. So, I put the red flags on pause. We kind of laughed that we had met before and didn't realize it. As we are talking he passed by the coffee place. He says I have a better place in mind. He drove us 15 miles outside of town in a country like area and pulled over. This area of town was rarely ever populated by moving traffic. We were alone and there was no way out. At this point I knew what was going to happen. I thought to myself \"great, now I'm an after school special\". He said that my top was really sexy and started to touch my breast. He began to kiss me and held my hands down with force. You guys can imagine what happened after that. He was kind about it (as kind as this situation could be) until I got up the courage to say no. Then he turned into a monster. I thought he would leave me for dead on the side of the road. After it was over  a wave of remorse hit him. He apologized for getting so rough. He begged me not to ruin his life.. I promised that I would never say a word to anyone and that I wanted it. He said he needed to hear me say I wanted it. It was pure survival  mode at that point. I would have said anything to get out of there alive. Once he felt reassured I wouldn't tell.

A was there for me at any hour of the day/night and comforted me when things were bleak and not looking good for my mom.\n\nWe made plans for New Year's (I live in New York and he lived in Kentucky) to go see the ball drop in the city and finally meet for the first time, but I was broke and December was really rough for my mom, so I cancelled.\n\nI quit school to take care of my mom and because I was so busy with her, we didn't talk as much. I started dating this guy and stopped talking to A altogether. It didn't last long and A messaged me after I had changed my relationship status back to single on Facebook. He told me he also had broken up with his girlfriend and from that point on, we were \"talking\".\n\nWe would be on the phone for hours, texting all day and night. We would download movies on our laptops and press play at the same time so we could watch it \"together\". He would call up Starbucks at the mall I worked in and buy me a drink over the phone, then tell me to go pick it up. He connected with my mom on Facebook to wish her well in her illness. He was in my opinion perfect. And I was falling HARD.\n\nThis went on for months. The week before my 20th birthday, my best friend told me we were going out to dinner with her boyfriend and a few of his friends that she wanted to try to hook me up with. She knew about A but didn't know it was \"serious\". I wasn't really interested but she kept bugging me and bugging me so I relented. \n\nWe go to dinner and A walks in with my best friends boyfriend instead of his friends. My heart dropped into my stomach and started doing the Cha Cha slide. He had contacted my best friend weeks before and wanted to surprise me for my birthday. He stayed for a whole week. We went to the local aquarium, the beach (he had never seen the ocean before), got slurpees (they don't have 7-Elevens where he's from) and went to Dave and Buster's, went paintballing. It was amazing. \n\nWe kissed the night before he left and I was heart broken he was leaving. He told me he would be back. The next day, he messaged my dad (whom I live with) and told him that he wanted to be with me and wanted to know if my dad could help him move to New York so that he could do that. My dad, impressed at the speech and how I was treated the week A was there, told him he could live with us rent free if he helped my dad with his business (I live on a poultry farm). It was labor intensive but A was extremely adamant about moving to NY to be with me. \n\nSo he did. A month later, he drove his little car from Kentucky to NY with his dog and all his belongings. \n\nThe first night he was there, he had run out to his car to get something. Our phones, both iPhones, were next to each other and one of them beeped. Thinking it was mine, I picked it up and saw there was a text from E. E was his exgirlfriend. The text said \"I miss my whalenugget\". I was super confused and slightly disgusted (whalenugget???) but he had just driven 9 hours, hundreds of miles with all of his belongings and his dog. I didn't sweat it and never mentioned it to him.\n\nThe first two weeks were heaven. I lost my virginity to him. Fell in love. Finished the summer with a new job, and new confidence. He was working with my dad and that was going well. My mom was on the mend finally and things were just going really good.\n\nThen he started getting phone calls from his mother saying how much she missed him, how could he leave her, why would he do this to her, etc. She would make passive aggressive Facebook statuses, would message me and ask for him. It was overwhelming, especially only a few weeks into the relationship, and it was every single day. \"How could you leave me, my baby!\" Gag.\n\nSomething changed about a month in. We had been having sex every single night and then it went to a few nights and then it stopped completely. We had been squeezing onto my twin mattress but suddenly he wanted the couch instead. He would blow my dad off to go fishing every single day, all day long. Didn't want to hang out with my friends anymore. And was always always on his phone.\n\nThis went on for another two weeks before he finally broke the news to me that his mother was falling into a deep depression and that he was going to have to move back home. I was devastated. \n\nHe moved back home and the next day on Facebook he was back in a relationship with E. Which was funny because him and I had never broken up...we had kissed goodbye and had sex the night before even. I received a message from E on Facebook that they had never broken up, hat it was just a \"break\" and that he needed to find himself, but he did and that's why he moved back home. I was furious that I had been used for the last two months. I was furious that he was an amazing liar. She sent me screenshots of conversations they had during the two months he lived with me. Making fun of my weight during sex, how bored he was there and how he couldn't wait to go home. Every single thing he had told me, was a fucking lie.\n\nI don't remember how it started but he started posting pictures that he took of me unknowingly on Twitter. And these were really really unflattering pictures. One in particular that has stuck with me was a picture of me and his dog on my couch that he tweeted to National Geographic and said \"Look @NatGeo, a whale is eating my dog!\" Another one read \"we all have that one fat bitch we've slept with. Guilty as charged.\" \n\nFor 10 months, this was every single day. Back then, you could block someone on Twitter but all blocking did was prevent the person from @ing you. I could still see all the tweets and morbid curiousity got me every single time. Didn't matter how many times I reported him to Twitter, they never took the tweets or his account down. Pictures I hadn't known he had taken. He had gone through my diary and posted entries on his Facebook that he and his friends and family commented and laughed at me on. \n\nEventually I stopped caring. I stopped looking at his social media accounts. I met someone else and eventually moved on. Hindsight really is 20/20. I wish I could go back and slap myself for ignoring the whalenugget bullshit.

We started chatting every day, eventually I met her brother Justin, and her close friend Norma. We all chatted on this IMVU website, sometimes played games on steam, hung out over skype. It was pretty great I even started dating Morrow. So, after dating for about a year she hits me with some weird shit, about her being a vampire and how shes over 2000 years old. Basically the vampire from those Christopher Pike novels.\nNow to preface here, this was around the time twilight got big, vampires were all the rage, and I was super naive so I still believed that almost anything could be possible, maybe. So I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, especially when her brother and friend are saying yeah she's totally a vampire and treated it as if it were some big family secret. (I know, fucking stupid in retrospect but I was young and really naive).\nfast forward a couple years I'm 17, still dating her and believing she is a vampire with this long history and a family. Even believed that maybe I had talked to God about it because of another set of circumstances in which a random number texted me and I asked about these things, and the other textee, or texter?...anyway the person who texted me seemed to understand all of this stuff that I was hiding from basically everyone I knew, because I knew on some level that it all sounded crazy as fuck. The short of it was I was just willing to believe and I loved Morrow.\n I was in my first year of college down in TN at this point, and I decided I was finally going to meet Morrow in person. Only one problem, she lived in MT, hence why I hadnt met her up to this point (although we had exchanged pictures throughout our relationship. I'd even gotten supposed pictures of all of her and said family together)\n So, I used my savings to move out to MT, but i was supposed to be moving with her 24 year old brother, Justin. I wouldn't be able to see her for several more months due to her taking a long trip to India to visit her ancestral vampire roots. Again, I know it sounds insane, but you see where this is going.\nEventually, we move in with other people, they help me to figure out that Justin was the only one who ever existed. I was 18 at this point so I had spent 3 years believing in this whole interconnected network of at least 8 people by now, but it turns out old Justin had been pulling the strings the whole time.

I don't bother replying to his sexual messages and report him to facebook again. A month later he sends me a new friend request on his third FB account. I report him to FB once again. His account is deleted....Have I won the battle? Close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I take a break from FB and spend some time on twitter. Little did I know, he has a twitter account and followed me and sent a series of sexual messages to me over a long period of time. Normally I don't read DMs, but I deleted all of the messages and blocked him on twitter. I tried reporting him to twitter but they don't do anything about it. Hi twitter is still active. Ugh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 2 years ago. My IRL friend calls me sobbing. I ask whats wrong. He apologizes for dragging me with him to meet the online guy. He says he should've listened to me and how it was wrong to chat with the guy online in the first place. To make matters worse, he says the online guy has been calling him, saying sexual things to him. Anyways I tell him to report online person to the police. Friend says hes too scared because no one will believe him. I tell my friend to block the number and just ignore him. So in the end, my friend unfriends the online guy and to this day, we haven't heard a peep from him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friend met a guy online. Drags me in. Got catfished. Guys a pedo.

We had met on an old school roleplay chat and eventually moved to skyping, since we both liked crafting. We both lived alone at the time, so we'd put on movies and sit and crochet or whatever, and that was a big chunk of our relationship. She was 24 and I was 22.\n\nShe seemed lonelier than me and spent a lot of time bemoaning how she had no friends or money. She had bought a house by herself at 21 and was part of multiple MLMs. I liked her enough that I just politely turned down all her offers to buy weight loss shakes and makeup. She was always angling for me to come visit, so when the opportunity came up, I let her know that I was helping a friend move a few hours away, so we'd be passing through. She graciously offered for us to crash at her place on the way.\n\nTurned out, she lived in the middle of this very 50s suburban neighborhood, in a one-bedroom house *with no doors*. On any of the rooms. She'd spent all her money trying to live this Facebook Mom Group life, despite being a single 20-something, so the house itself was basically empty with pillows on the floor in lieu of furniture. She had no bathroom door or table, but she had an expensive coffee maker and a metric ton of weight loss shakes. She was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag. She never had anyone over, because she barely had friends in real life, so her house was staged to keep up appearances with her mom friends online, and not really meant to be lived in. \n\nWe decided to be polite and make do, but the bathroom was facing the living/bed area such that you had to look dead into the house if you sat on the toilet.

And because of this he was basically 'powering' us through the game. Through his travels, he met a girl on there that called herself Katie. Katie sent us pictures of herself, told us she was from New Zealand. She slowly injected herself in to our MSN groups and added us all one by one. We were all like 14-15+ at the time, so it was somewhat interesting having a girl in our calls who liked Video games like us, until she started having private conversations with us separately. She never spoke on Voice, as she didn't have a mic and was always very quick on text. Mostly every conversation was a competitive \"1-up\" battle, where she'd talk about how great she was at seemingly everything. Renown Ballet dancer? Check. Beyond Grade 8 in Piano? Check. Knew 3 different Languages? Check. I had really really bad eyesight, she had worse. My friend beat Halo on Legendary, she did it before them. All the while being constantly online. We were a tight knit group and she was starting to divide us all so I think one by one we all got sick of her bullshit and dropped her completely.

At the time, I was playing a very geared Alt character and she would group with me for Dungeons. She was very competitive, and I enjoyed talking to her but she was in to some really weird shit. Would link me cartoon pictures of herself without limbs, claiming she had an amputation fetish. Would ask me that if she wanted to die, would I be the one that did it. She'd link me pictures of her bruised feet from Ballet, saying she wants to saw them off. She'd link me her prescription papers, complaining about her vision and claiming that she'd like to get an eye removed so someone could fuck her eye socket.

I don't really remember what triggered it, but it was heavily implied she was going to kill herself and then I heard nothing for a day.\n\nThis girl lives on the other side of the world, and I had way more than enough information from her to contact her brother to make sure she was okay.

I grew up in a cult, had an abusive uncle, and lived with my single mom who had bipolar/schizoaffective disorder. I was awkward as hell, had no social skills or self-confidence, and home life sucked. So let's get to the three.\n\n1) I had been playing an online text-based game with a guy that lived two hours away. I thought he was the coolest guy, really nice. One night my mom bashed my head in with a lamp (she was the sweetest woman when she was well, but violence was common when off her meds)-- bleeding and desperate, I message him about what happened.\n\nHe told me \"Hey, I talked to my parents and we are coming to get you right now\". Never met him before, they came and picked me up and I moved in with them. I had a trash bag full of some clothes and nothing else. I had just turned 16 a month before.\n\nThe VERY first night I was there the mom got drunk, started ramming her Mercedes into the dad's BMW (on purpose), and the son pulled a gun on mom to get her to stop. Mom runs off into the night and moved in with her boyfriend (she'd been cheating - dad didn't know until that night).\n\nSo all three of us are in a bad place. We played Monopoly and ate junk food until like 3am.\n\nI got a job at Walmart, started community college (I got my GED at 16), things seemed ok.\n\nThe family very generously was letting me live at their place for free. The dad was pretty well off so he didn't bat an eye at taking me to dinner with his son and paying for it, etc. I'd never experienced anything like this in my life, we had always lived hand-to-mouth.\n\nAbout three months in dad gets arrested. Apparently he was a prominent member of the \"Republic of Texas\" movement that wanted to cede from the Union, and as a \"sovereign citizen\" hadn't paid his taxes in years. House and cars get seized for back taxes, son goes with his grandma, but I find myself with no place to live.\n\nI ended up moving back home.\n\n2) Two months after moving back home my mom tried to stab me in the chest with a knife - I caught her wrist in time so it barely broke skin. I decided it was time to leave again.\n\nI had been talking to a girl online for about six months. She lived near Chicago, I lived in Texas. We are both 16.\n\nSo naturally I think \"I'll take a bus to Chicago and get a job there\". Because that's what rational teens do, right?\n\nI saved up for about a month from my crappy data entry job, didn't tell my mom I was leaving, and went straight to Chicago (a small suburb, actually).\n\nI knock on the door of the address she gave me (she asked me to come, of course). Nobody answers. I call a mutual friend that went to school with her from a pay phone (remember those?), and friend confesses that the girl had catfished me the whole time.\n\nShe was using the friend's pictures (the girl I went to see was around 300 lbs, not the hot teen she was pretending to be), and both girls thought it was really funny - until I actually showed up.\n\nThe girl I went to meet eventually did come out and apologized to me profusely, she had been catfishing almost a dozen guys because she was addicted to the attention. Hot friend apologized too.\n\nI hopped on a bus and went back to Texas feeling defeated.\n\n3) Home life still sucked. I started talking to another girl online (because I was too awkward for real relationships). She lived in Canada.\n\nTwo weeks after my 18th birthday I flew up there thinking \"I'll get a job in Canada, everything will be fine\". This was before 9/11 and you didn't need a visa.\n\nAt airport security in Canada I went through customs. Apparently I knew nothing about immigration or the law.

I downloaded Gmod (cause, you know, that was the \"big thing\" at the time).  There, I met my first (and last) online group.  There were, like, twelve of us(?), and I was one of three girls.  The ring-leader of sorts was this one guy who was a senior in high school.  For this story, I'm gonna call him Joe (not his real name).\n\nNow, at the time, my parents were EXTREMELY overprotective of me online, as my mother saw the online world as an absolute evil and my dad just went along with what she said because he didn't know much about the platform.  So, I wasn't allowed show my face, I couldn't use my real name, and if I played with multiple people, one of my parents HAD to be in the room so they could make sure I didn't accidentally let any personal information slip.  No one in the group even knew how old I was; they assumed I was older because--at the time--I had a deep voice for a fourteen-year-old girl (they assumed I was in college because of this).\n\nWell, fast forward about a month and the group went from using no cameras at all to always using face cams and even just calling on Skype instead of gaming.  For a while, they were okay with me not revealing my face, but they assumed I was just shy or self-conscious.  It wasn't until then that I accidentally let slip that I was in high school (complaining about a teacher that hated me because I stood up for a girl with a \"fake\" learning disability), and then everyone wondered if it was a good idea to keep me there, as most of them were either seniors in high school or older.  Now, Joe wasn't the oldest (he was a senior in high school himself), but he was the ring-leader, so it was up to him whether or not I stayed.  He said it was fine, as he had been a part of this particular group since he was in middle school.  \n\nNow, I'm not exactly sure when this happened because I was kept out of the loop on a lot of things (I was told about this by Joe's friend way after this happened), but Joe and one of the girls (I'll call her Belle) got into a huge argument.  Apparently Belle had a huge crush on Joe, but he wasn't interested, and this exploded into most of the group getting involved because Belle was being immature about it and decided to vent to everyone.  When Belle found out that I knew she got rejected, she then started to vent to me about stuff she didn't like about Joe (he's a slob, he shows too much favoritism, etc, etc).  Why? I don't know.  Maybe to save face or to make me hate him?  I really don't know.  I was a freshman, and I didn't understand relationship drama of any kind. \n\nAbout a week after I found out about everything, Belle called me and told me to stop flirting with Joe.  Now, here's the thing:  I HADN'T BEEN FLIRTING WITH ANYONE.  Everyone in the group knew that I was not interested in dating, that I was a bit young to date (again, I was a freshman), and they all knew that my parents HEAVILY monitored my internet use (again, I couldn't even show my face).  No matter what I told her though, she wouldn't listen.  \n\nFrom here, things get a bit...weird.  At a scarily fast speed.   I didn't tell Joe about Belle's interrogation, but everyone found out.  The group basically banned all girls except me (the other girl took Belle's side and went on a similar tirade), and the guys assured me that nothing would be different now that girls were banned.  Boy was THAT a lie.  Suddenly, instead of girls joining the group to game, random girls would join the Skype calls for like two gaming sessions, leave, then be replaced for another two gaming sessions.  I also realized that these girls never actually played with us; they kinda just flirted with the guys and encouraged them while they played.  I started to get weirded out by this (cause, you know, this was NOT what I had agreed to join when I first started playing).  I slowly started to pull away from the group, and Joe, noticed.  So he asked me if I wanted to have a \"cheerleader\" for myself (Joe was the second person I told I was bi).  I not-so-politely declined, as I thought it was extremely disgusting.  I reminded him that I was a minor, and he said that he knew girls my age that would love me.  I, again, declined.  He asked me to turn my webcam on (\"Come on, your parents won't know if you turn your camera on and then just open up the gaming window), but I refused, as I was scared of what would happen if my parents ever found out. Which pissed him off.  He then said that he didn't want me to play, but would love for me to be his \"cheerleader,\" which would require me to use my webcam.  I declined and basically cursed him out as best I could (again, my parents were kinda within earshot).  The other guys each asked me at some point or another to be their \"cheerleader,\" and one guy found out we live in the same state and asked if I wanted to hook up with him (he was 17 at the time).  I was so disgusted by all this, so I left.  This experience wasn't the only reason I haven't joined another gaming group, but it is definitely a major factor.\n\nI was told later by the third girl that had left with Belle years later that it was best I left, because Belle came back, and she and Joe have apparently blocked everyone that was in that group and began to date about a year after I left...yeah...\n\nSorry it was so long.\n\nEdit: So I don't know much of the details about the girls and the how and why they were there. This was years ago and I was kept out of the loop because I was the only girl. The best reason I can give for them being there is that none of the guys really had any girlfriends (probably because of their attitudes and behavior) and having girls around to boost their egos and flirt made them feel better?

I hung out with her mom and did some exploring by myself including a day trip to Cologne and went for a weekend trip to Paris.\n\nOn the morning I was leaving, we were having breakfast and it\u2019s when I realized (after about a week), that things weren\u2019t okay.

I had made sure to be the best darn Canadian I could be. I constantly was polite, said please and thank you.

We talk on the phone after and she tells me exactly what I was wearing and also described the friend I was with perfectly.  Told me she was standing right next to me but didn't have the courage to say hello.  Buttered me up with \"You're really really hot and I want you really really bad and I panicked.\"  \n\nI decided hey, it happens lets try this again.  I take a different friend with me this time and we went to a spot on The Strip in Vegas.  My friend and I were standing outside a MCDs on the sidewalk and kept hearing a girl in a car driving by yelling \"WOO HOOO!!\" which was a catchphrase of sorts for her and I immediately recognized it.  My best friend started talking sense into me and telling me I was a putz if I stayed any longer.  We left.\n\nI wrote her a long email when I got home and basically told her I really appreciated being made a fool of and that we should probably just stop talking.\n\nA few days later I started finding notes on my car after work from her.

We're playing basketball and a car pulls up with a single woman inside.  She says she's this girls mother and that she won't be bothering me anymore.  She also said that she can see why she was obsessed with me as she looked me up and down.  She was maybe 50, quite large, had really bad caked on makeup and a slight smell of sulfur masked by a strong perfume.  I'll never know **for sure** if this woman was indeed her mother or was the stalker herself.\n\nShit scares me now that I'm older.

Before Netflix and Chill, we had VHS and couch.  The woman wasn't especially pretty, but was smart and rich (daughter of a doctor) and really liked me so I give it a go.  Our first date she wants to meet at her place and watch a movie.  Great, I figure I'm in like Flynn!\n\nSo I arrive at her address, and feel even luckier as it's a new neighborhood of McMansions, years before that expression was even coined.  Walking inside, it's a semi open floor plan showcasing a professionally maintained *rainforest* in a 25X25 floor to ceiling glass on 4 sides area in the middle of everything, open to the sky and now perfectly lit at night.  I make a good impression on her Doctor Dad with some smart banter, then we settle in for the movie.\n\nHer Girl Game soon proved to be as awkward as her unkempt plain looks, as she started making over-the-top PDAs with her Dad sitting nearby, nose buried in some scholarly tome.   I was trying to keep the escalation slow and discreet below couch level, and she kept putting both arms around me and leaning in too heavily, causing us to shift and move in the Good Doctor's periphery, even though he's apparently fine with it all.\n\nAt one point, she gets on all fours, ass up and pointing in the general direction of her Dad, and starts making out *with my ear.*  Mind you, we haven't actually kissed yet, but now she's breathing and slobbering loudly into my ear while her tongue explores it indiscriminately in a pattern like a Norway Rat trying to find the little platform in the dark experimental dunk tank.  Finally, she let out a low moan which was supposed to be sexy, but at that intimate distance of 0mm to my ear canal was more like a whale call fit to carry across countless nautical miles.  Then she plunged her tongue piston-like into my ear canal, simulating upon one eardrum a sudden dive to fathoms of depth and barometric pressure whales are accustomed to, causing me to jump up and yelp.  I locked eyes with her very Jewish father, while a long awkward moment passed while no explanation was asked or offered as to why the hitherto nice very blonde and white boy suddenly jumped up and shouted,  \"**OYE!**\" while in the process of making out with his daughter, whose ass is still up and pointing in his general direction.  The moment passes; we get settled back into the movie, and at some point he bids us a friendly good night and pads silently into the dark catacombs of his suburban castle.\n\nNext lull in the movie, I go in for a regular kiss, which she overeagerly reciprocates.   She PLUNGES her tongue into my mouth as deep as she can, then swishes it back and forth rhythmically, like a windshield wiper.  I try to interact using my tongue, but hers just sweeps it aside like a bug, and continues the determined *Swish-Swosh-Swish-Swosh!*   I break for air, then we kiss again, hoping it was a fluke.   Nope, she plunges the tongue straight in again, and starts sweeping back and forth mechanically.\n\nNow we've gotten through the movie and she invites me to spend the night.  She leads me to bed, strips down to a shirt and underwear, then says just a minute and goes into the bathroom across the hall.  I'm lying there thinking it's weird but hey, easy pussy coming right up.\n\nA minute turns to ten, then twenty; during which my detective ears picked up the distinctive sounds of several sizes and hardnesses of pills rattling around different size bottles as they were upturned to disgorge their various rewards, and bouts of ugly crying.  Finally, she burst in, turned out the light, and climbed into bed with me and immediately started to try to make out.   I paused the action and asked, are you okay?  She said yes, but it was obvious she had been crying and might start again with every unsteady breath.   She was obviously rapidly coming under the influence of whatever pills she popped, and the whole thing was now just a sea of red flags, so I pulled the ripcord and made apologies as I quickly dressed to go.  She clung to me and pleaded, \"I don't want to lose you!\" as I thought, \"We JUST FUCKING MET TODAY!\" \n\nWalked out of that palace of grave dysfunction, got in my inappropriately old and inexpensive car and drove out of the clutches of McMansionville forever."}]}, {"id": "bk8ypo", "title": "Gamers of Reddit: what video game are you currently playing?", "comments": [{"score": 10706, "id": "emex9gh", "text": "Me and four friends are doing a generational Crusader Kings 2 game where we play as one character from the death of the last players character until the death of our own character.   \n\n\nWe started as a minor count (though independent) in Brittany and we are now kings of Burgundy and Brittany.

I absolutely was. \n\nI grew up in an affluent area of Orange County CA. My family had money, but not nearly enough as many of the kids at my school. I was an only child, got picked on, had pretty low self-esteem. My family were basically country club racists. Basically they didn't actively drop N Bombs all over the place, but they had prejudices and didn't push back at all when I started saying racist things as a kid. I absolutely said the N word with my friends, laughed about it, but was always too scared to do so publically.\n\nWhen I got to high school, I was big into right wing politics, wanting to join the army, and learning German. I wouldn't say I was a neo-Nazi, my best friend's brother was a neo-Nazi and I didn't hang out with any of his friends or want to go into that scene, but I often thought that I would have made a good Nazi had I been a German during the Third Reich. I definitely had friends in high school, but I wanted to go to college in a place that was more conservative and less diverse than I currently was. I figured my life would improve if I went to a place like that. \n\nSo what changed? I did move to a small Midwest town and started taking German in college for real, I took history courses that kind of started to chip away at my view of the world. Studying abroad in Germany though my Junior year is what really started to break the glass on my views. I thought that my German background and last name would win me some favors over there, but people didn't really give a shit at all. I saw that modern Germany was categorically and vastly different than the one I crafted in my head. I made friends from all over Europe and the world. I had some people I cared about really roast me for some nationalist and militaristic views I had, it made me really mad at the time but eventually, I took their criticism seriously. \n\nI came back and finished doing some work in history classes and wrote a paper on Nazi propaganda. It was then that I really examined Nazi viewpoints through recent experience sand saw how fucking dumb they were. I remember seeing a poster and the text said that the Jews were both behind Communism and Capitalism and just thought, this is just complete fucking nonsense and the people who believe this are morons. \n\nI actually did go into the military, I did ROTC in college and my time in ROTC and active duty pretty much flushed the rest out of me. Getting to know, working with, and leading people from different backgrounds and getting to see things through their eyes was an invaluable experience.\n\nSo to summarize, meeting people from different backgrounds is probably the most important for me and really actually having meaningful conversations, and not walking way when you're challenged. The thing is, I didn't just say 'you're right, nationalism and being racist is wrong I get it now' when I was in Germany. I fought back, I defended myself, I thought these people were just butthurt leftists and weren't going to take anything I said seriously anyway. But those conversations planted the seeds that grew over several months, and eventually, they made me recognize how wrong I was. Second was I always knew it was wrong to hate people, but I still did. I didn't have an online support structure to keep me in the mindframe. Had these online communities existed 10 years ago, I don't know if I could have broken out of this.\n\nEdit: let me just add because people are seeing this. You often hear that hate is a poison. A huge part of being such a racist is being angry that so much of the world that doesn't conform to your narrow views of what a society should look like. You waste so much energy being so angry all the time. Everytime you see a group of people in a place where you don't think they should be, or a couple of different ethnicities, or hearing different languages where you don't think you should be hearing them, you just react to this with anger it's just so fucking poisonous. Once I started to let go of this a little bit, I tried to think about these feelings and wondered why I felt them. Why were all of these people making me so angry? And why did I think it would be so much better if I was somewhere else? The answer, of course, were problems in my own life, my own feelings of inadequacy, my feelings I squandered a privileged background and couldn't meet my parents' expectations. Once I started making those connections and take steps to improve the things in my own life I could control, I felt a lot better about myself and felt that I had a lot more to value in myself than being just a white guy from Newport. \n\nHate really is poisonous. It poisons your self-image, your impression of others, your sense of empathy, your ability to humanize problems, your ability to connect with friends and family. But it doesn't have to be a death sentence, you can break out of the negatively reinforcing thought process. Start by reading stories of people who are totally different from you, watch movies made by people like this, just try and kickstart the apparatus in all of us to give a shit about people. I've had the opportunity to travel to so many places since my first time in Germany and the thing I've learned above all else is people by and large want the same things, to live somewhere cool, the hang out with their friends, provide for their families, etc. I'm sorry that it took me a while to learn this, but I do hope someone can see this and start have a gutcheck moment with themselves to think differently about how you think of others.\n\nedit2: go figure, I have a reddit account for 5 years and my first gold is on a throwaway where I confess to having been a bad human being.

In other words, I was that, \"Slavery is over. Here's an MLK quote, but affirmative action is bullshit. I have a black friend.\" white person. \\* cringe \\*\n\nSo anyway, what changed all that was first of all, joining the Army and actually living among people of every race, religion, background, and persuasion, in reasonably close quarters, for a few years of my life. When you actually get to know people well enough that a few of them will tell you how things really have been for them, it's really eye-opening. That was what showed me that no, things actually aren't equal now, even though the laws would make it seem as if they were. We're still experiencing the world in very different ways.\n\nAfter I got out of the Army, and went to a state university for an engineering degree. Two really important things happened there.\n\nFirst, my history professor, when I was a freshman, was a black woman who told the side of the story that you don't hear about much in most history classes. Sometimes I was skeptical of what she was saying, but I'd always Google it, and it turned out she was right. This opened my eyes to the fact that there's this whole story of our country that most of us never even hear, and that there are real and ongoing reasons for policies like affirmative action, and that concepts like reparations actually aren't crazy when you consider the ongoing economic impact of policies like Jim Crow laws.\n\nThe other thing that happened which opened my eyes was when I was a junior, I got pulled over by a cop for speeding on the way to class, and was talking with my classmates about it. My experience as a white woman was that I got pulled over, and given a warning. My white male classmates said the police officers in our town (this was in the south, just for reference) were usually cordial with them, but always gave them the ticket. The one black woman in the conversation said the police were a bit rude to her and she always got the ticket, and the two black men had some real horror stories about this stuff, how they were always made to get out of the car, were sometimes asked if they could search the car, etc. It was just so obvious how differently we were treated.\n\nFrom then on, I made more of an effort to understand where POC are coming from when they say something is an issue rather than just thinking it's not an issue because it's not an issue for me. I used to not believe people on stuff like that, which was pretty fucking racist of me, but just learning more about it and listening to people's experience really changed my mind."}, {"score": 2982, "id": "en8gdiq", "text": "I wasn\u2019t a self-proclaimed \u201cracist\u201d, I actually was very certain I wasn\u2019t racist at all.

I went over to the candy section and picked up 4 boxes of Mike and Ike for the 2 of us to binge while we write a YouTube script. On my way to the cash register, I ran into my grandmother. She saw me then saw my friend and gave him a pissy stinking look, then the look on her face snapped and smiled at me which was weird. We had small talk and I introduced her to my friend, James. James and I were friends for about 5 1/2 years. My grandmother only heard of James, but never saw him in person. I told her my friend is James, the guy who I always hang out with and she had a shocked look on her face. She told me \"ddunknjay, you know candy is bad for you right? It'll ruin your teeth and ruin your life\" and she went off. I mentally thought \"wait pause, Mike and Ike is life\", and ignored most of what she was telling me.

Story time.\n\nOnce upon a time, MTV produced a reality TV show called \"[Made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_(TV_series))\".

MTV would set them up with a life coach / fitness trainer / tutor / whatever, and capture their progress as they were \"made\" into the better person they wanted to be.\n\nMy classmate, \"Beans\", had no such lofty ambitions.  He was a total fuck-up.  All he wanted to do was *graduate high school*.  He had already failed at this (yup, he was a super-senior).  MTV picked him.  I still can't imagine why.\n\nSo my whole senior year, MTV camera crews were roaming the halls of my high school, mostly following Beans, but others were capturing other shots of the building and the students.  Beans had a mentor assigned to him.  Some tough-as-nails wannabe drill sergeant to push Beans in the right direction.  Someone to get Beans to study, stop partying, stop doing drugs, stop getting in trouble.\n\nBeans didn't change one bit.  He kept doing drugs, he kept partying, he kept getting in trouble, he remained a delinquent.  He and his idiot friends even went out joyriding around town and bashing in mailboxes with a baseball bat.  Local police caught them.  We'll come back to this later.\n\nDespite the fact that Beans legitimately should have failed his Senior year again, the faculty caved to MTV's pressure and gave him barely-passing marks.  Beans walked last in the graduation ceremony so he would get an extra-big cheer.  It was all dreadfully fake and cringey.\n\nA couple months after graduation, the episode aired.  Beans, stupid stupid Beans, flat-out told the MTV camera that he had lied to the local police that night when he had been bashing in mailboxes.\n\nAfter the episode aired, and his self-incrimination made national television, *the police came back for him*.  I don't know how it all ended (I moved on with my life and out of that town), but from the sound of things he was in deep trouble.  He never stopped being a fuck-up.  He never self-improved in any way.  He never stopped being a druggie loser.

It happened one semester before my first. One of my professors relayed the story to my ootl ass, so I'll try to stick to how she told it. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nMy university has a faculty union. Around 10 years ago, they noticed the spike in university shootings and wanted to do something about it. At the time, all the buildings on campus had outside locks on their classrooms and each professor had a key. In an active shooter setting, professors would have to lock the door. That meant that they would have to step outside the classroom, find the key on their key ring, get it in the lock with their undoubtedly unsteady hands, and step back inside the classroom to close the door and block it.\n\nThis, of course, is extremely dangerous. It's time consuming, puts the professor in immense amounts of danger, and by extension, puts the students in danger as well. If a shooter sees this, they can shoot the professor and stride in to massacre the students. The union decided that they wanted a solution: installation of simple lockable thumbturn deadbolts on the inside. That way, all they would have to do is close the door and turn the lock. No stepping into the path of a shooter, no fiddling with keys, nothing.\n\nThe union approached the higher-ups with this idea and they were declined on the basis of expense. They asked the next year; nope, too expensive. They asked the next year. And the next. And the next. Over a decade passed.\n\nFinally, with the Parkland shooting earlier in the year, something had to be done. If a shooter comes into a classroom, what would be the best item to use to defend yourself? Well, ideally, a weapon, but the university has a no weapons policy. The next best thing? Something small, heavy, easy to aim and throw, and guaranteed to stun them. Something like a cue ball or...a hockey puck.\n\nWith the help of some local businesses, the union bought over 2500 hockey pucks and distributed them across campus. Students were told to keep them in their backpacks and to use them as a last resort against a shooter. While news outlets quickly picked it up and assumed that they were serious about using them to defend against shooters, there was a deeper purpose to them. Each of them had a code on the back that would lead students to a donation page to purchase indoor locks.\n\nIt was seized within the day. Many outlets had articles about it, interviewing students, professors, campus police, etc., who all played along with their initial assumption. The message was clear: because they wouldn't protect us, we had to take our defense into our own hands.

I was *wasted*, as was everyone else - so when a female friend turned up in her brand new 4x4 and promptly fell asleep the obvious course of action was for us to \u201cborrow\u201d the vehicle for a joyride around the lanes of Somerset... This was, actually, pretty anomalous for us - drink-driving was always heavily frowned upon - but clearly under the influence of anything and everything it all seemed to make perfect sense.\n\nFor the next while - I was far too pissed to know how much time was passing - we took turns speeding round the roads in what was effectively a stolen car, drinking and getting (even more) high. My turn came last and everyone was joking about our good fortune running out and us getting nicked/dying in a fiery crash (ha... ha.... ha...) - especially with me behind the wheel, as we were quite close to the spot where I\u2019d been a passenger in a crash the previous year. Which was thoroughly reassuring.\n\nI settled in and started tearing up the lanes - can\u2019t remember what the vehicle was but it was great fun to hoon round in (and a bit different: automatics aren\u2019t especially common in the UK) - and put on The Prodigy for the ideal soundtrack. Turning the corner I saw that we were at the start of a long straight (an old Roman road leading to Glastonbury) ideal for just flooring it - so that\u2019s what I did... \n\nAt the end of the straight I made the turn with, I think, two wheels ever-so-slightly leaving the ground - and I\u2019ll never forget the definitely discernible shift of mood that caused in all of us, like \u201cyeah OK that was a little close... It\u2019s time to stop this\u201d. - just before I saw flashing lights in my rear-view mirror and my whole world got ready to go down the shitter.

Outwardly I was totally dispassionate and calm (to the extent that later one of my friends said he\u2019d decided I was either a psychopath or a terminator) but internally I was screaming, sobbing and already trying to guess how many years inside I was looking at... \n\nFinally I saw a place to pull in, and put my indicator on like pulling back the hammer on my suicide.
